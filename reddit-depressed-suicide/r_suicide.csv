0,Holy crap I’m back,"Is that what this account will be? Pouring my heart out to strangers high on my latest fix, low on my latest failure, left to plateau with my head just above water? I’m breathing but barely, and too much. Breath caught in my throat in almost sobs, a deep breath in for that life saving smoke, that smothers all else, even at the cost on my conscious. Such expensive habits, only slightly more effective than nothing at all. But I cling to my vices for just on more step down and I may actually cry, whether I allow it or not. But the world doesn’t stop for misery, work isn’t canceled for the headache from long repressed tears. I only wish I had enough left of me to remember how I survived before my addictive indulgence. I push these feelings out by force, blasting my ear drums into an even sadder state, erasing and rewriting until the feelings come out just right, until I’ve run out of steam and lie helplessly in bed as though I’m in a coma waiting for someone to pull the plug. Even when nothing’s happened today to cause such a spike, my medications taken, my life unchanged. No worse for wear, but no better. Is this my lowest? A faceless stranger with a story so tragic only for you to see and wish you could help, and wishing for help yourself. I’m not sure why I’m writing here again. Perhaps I crave that level state, not feeling good but no longer feeling as though I could just will my soul to leave my body and for once, truly rest. That would be it, the depressing icing on this sadcake. I can’t bring myself to write the note, but I can write to all of you, and just for a moment, feel just a little better."
1,Telling someone not to kill themselves seems as useful as telling a serial killer not to kill you. :D,"Also, stop telling people ""Think about your family"". 

Think about what it's doing to me to continue being here. Think about how it is to feel trapped almost everywhere you go. Yeah, to suffer through that constantly? No."
2,My life is meaningless,"



I just want to kill myself. I cannot get rid of my problems and everyone else refuses to fix me. Killing myself apparently is the only way to get rid of my problems and take my pain away. Not therapy. Not medications. Not going to the hospital. I never had any friends irl, I can’t get a girl friend, online friends just leave me, the best friend I ever had left me 2 months ago and I really miss her, no one wants or appreciates me, I have no reason for people to like me, I don’t have any skills for people to like me, college isn’t preparing me for the life ahead of college. I just want to kill myself"
3,I think this is my last option,"It's not that I want to die. It's that I have to. I've gone to everyone and tried everything I can think of for help. None of it has helped. People have tried, and tried hard, and so have I, and it hasn't made a damn bit of difference. What else is there to do when you've tried everything else, and can't keep going forward feeling like this? I'm surprised I've even made it this long, honestly. I don't know what else I can do but kill myself, and then none of this will hurt me anymore."
4,I don't think I can do this,"I have midterms and the last thing I wanna do is study for them.  Last night and this morning I spent all my time studying for a single test, which I then failed miserably.  I got tutored.  I used all the resources I could find and asked all the questions I had.  The thing is, this test I was over what I wanted to do when I grow up.  But I guess that's not happening.  

And now I'm so done with studying, the last thing I wanna do is study for my midterms tomorrow.  Not only is the exam tomorrow, but we also had a take home exam over a unit never taught in class.  Never.  I don't know what anything means.  And sure, I could just look everything up.  But I don't want to.

I wasted weeks studying for something I ultimately failed, why would I continue studying now?

And I guess where all this is going..... this is a common theme in my life.  Not even common, it's the ONLY theme.  I constantly try so hard at everything.  I recently even started trying to be happy after 10 years of self harm and suicide attempts.  But after a month of believing the bs that my life has purpose, I'm just back where I started, wanting to get in bed and never get out, cutting in class discreetly enough that no one notices, digging out chunks of my flesh and eating it.  I'm a failure at everything.  And I can't do this anymore.  I can't live my life in a constant state of disappointment and depression.

I'm sure people would be sad if I was gone.  They only notice when you're not there anymore.  Until then, they don't care.   They see me crying.  They see me distancing myself from everyone and everything.  And what do they do?  Nothing.  So why should I stay here and live in misery to keep them from crying when they don't even bother to act like I exist.  Maybe it is selfish.  They'll get over it.  I've gotten over all the selfish things people have done against me.  We all do.

I have the energy for nothing.  I have the desire for nothing.  There is nothing left.  I can't drag my useless self around anymore.  It's hard enough getting out of bed, let alone going places and doing things.  I'm so tired.  I'm so tired of everything.  

I'm going to bed.  I'm going to bed and I'm never getting out.  No one cares anyways.  I certainly don't."
5,I don't likethe way the world is headed.,"everyone is a fucking soulless vampire, we've created machines to do the things we're too lazy for, soon there will be nothing left of the planet that hasn't been corrupted due to corporate greef. the world's societies will collapse before 2035 and frankly I don't want to deal with the fallout of it all"
6,"I ordered supplies but I’m not sure how it will work out. I hope posting on this sub will give me motivation not to back out. Hopefully I won’t have to delete this post later. Two more days only, wish me luck!",
7,10 days,
8,What can i overdose on that will kill me the fastest?,I just want to die painlessly in my sleep.
9,"Rejected by society as an adult non-straight woman, plus trauma from school bullying","I am completely messed up by my years being bullied in school. It completely changed me as a person from an outgoing child to severely anxious and mentally ill and traumatized. A lot of horrible things happened there. 

One of the worst things my bullies did was that they made a fake profile of me full of homophobic, transphobic and disgusting sexually explicit stuff about me. I never spoke to any of them, but they were obsessed with me not being straight, which I later came to realize was true about halfway through high school. I finally learned that I was asexual by the time I was in college and it was really liberating. But this coming of age learning about myself in college thing didn't do much for my self esteem, because in the end I was too mentally ill to finish my college course and had to come back to my home town. I now live as a person on disability, unable to be in a typical work environment due to severe anxiety. I can only do extremely isolated odd jobs where I don't have to interact with people. I also make art that sometimes sells. The fake profile is still online because I don't want to deal with it. It feels like if a person shat on your front porch and YOU had to clean it up. That sort of thing. So I've never touched it. Plus, in a sad way, it is satisfying to have some tangible proof of the hell I experienced on a regular basis. I like to think if anyone stumbles upon my cyber bullies creation intended for me that they would know what it was and they would have sympathy for me and maybe someone ELSE would remove it.  

Present day, people in my town from my school days PLUS younger kids still make fun of me if they see me out in public. I get called ugly and worthless. There has never been the deeply gratifying ""I apologized to her years later"" moment. I am dirt to people and they make sure I don't forget it. None of my accomplishments matter. The fact that I dress better doesn't matter. People in my town just want to snuff me out. They have been trying for years to drive me to suicide or at least to disintegrate to drug addiction or something. I can't get help at the local mental health clinic because the young people in the waiting room also make fun of me and tell me I'm ugly. 

How to deal with society hating me?"
10,Not sure why writing this but want to,"Will be 30 in few months and realized I wasted my life and there are zero reasons to continue this 

I have tried killing myself in past but wasn't able to do it properly, ending up with therapy sessions and all that shit which doesn't help 

Will try one more time soon after researching enough about the perfect way to end it so that I die in seconds and don't end up in hospital or some other shit place 

Hope my mom dad forget me in few weeks, it will be painful for them but there is no other way left"
11,On my way to overdose myself and fucking die.,Since I'm abandoned and nothing has progressed for my life no matter how hard I tried promise me I tried everything. I'm just gonna get whatever of pills and overdose from it. I'm FUCKING DONE OF THIS BULLSHIT IM TIRED
12,I tried to kill myself Monday night,"Its finals week but I really couldn't care less about my grades. My sister and her 7yo daughter were at my house and when I went to go say goodbye to my niece she said ""bye! See you soon!"" Jesus fuck that woke me up a little and made me question wtf I was doing. None the less  I took some pills laid down in my formal black dress and heels and didn't die. Kind of upset I woke up the next morning. went to class and took my Spanish midterm. I'm still here and alive. Might try again."
13,"Im messing up at life, I’m scared","     Ok so sorry if this is messy, I’m not the best at explaining how I feel or whatever. Ok so I’m spoiled, my parents are well off and if I asked for it they’d get it. It’s been like this since I was a kid, they also did it with my older sister ( a lil stricter with her, due to a reason I’ll get to). They thing is the more they give, the shitter I feel, I don’t want them to waste money. I don’t need headphones or an iPad etc etc, I’d tell them but never worked. I sound like a brat and should be greatful, the thing is I think I grew up emotionally neglected? I’m not fully sure but I was alone for most my childhood, again spoiled physically but emotionally I had nothing.  I wanna pay them back once I get a job, but it’s gonna be a lil while. And I feel terrible 
      I also developed OCD at a really young age, due to my lack of bond with my parents they never noticed. I love my parents! It’s just I never really had them in my life? Anyways my OCD got worse, then it turned to depression. I started self harming in 6th grade until my parents found out in 8th, I was sent to a shitty hospital that didn’t care about my feelings. They basically just gave me medication and sent me on my way, each appointment is just a short talk and done. I don’t want to stay there any longer so I lied about me getting better, plus the sooner I get out the less money my parents spend on me. Yes, I still self harm and yes I did attempt suicide. 
         It doesn’t help that in school I’m a burst of energy and tend to act on my emotions, I’ve been told that I’m too childish or loud. I’m friends with this one guy, but he hits me or insults me. I know I should stand up for myself, but I guess once I got to high school I got more scared? It’s not rare for people to insult me in school, I make fun of myself etc etc. It just gets too far, my guy “friend” gave me a bruise on my right arm just recently. Of course I don’t wanna do anything, I don’t think it’s a big deal. 
            Anyways here I am, gonna turn 16 soon. Yet nothing has changed, I still have the same intrusive thoughts. I’m spoiled, which adds to my grief. Bullied, insecure. I sound like a brat, I’m sorry but I just don’t know what to do. I’ve thought about how much happier my parents would be without me, and how much grief I’ll escape from. No more scary thoughts, no wasting money, no bullies. I’m scared."
14,Should probably just do it tbh,
15,Extremely depressed about a character death.,"There is a certain character that I absolutely love in a show that I watch called RWBY. Well, she died very unfairly and cruely. Ever since I witnessed her death, I haven't been the same. I've been depressed for weeks and sometimes feel like never eating again. I've been holding onto hope that she will get brought back, but it doesn't seem like that will happen since it's been years since the death happened in 2016. My heart hurts so much and I feel like killing myself some days. Maybe in the afterlife or another life she will be happy and safe."
16,"What do you guys think about 2020 and what are you doing to prepare for it, if anything?","I don’t want to live to see it. I want to die.

I don’t think my mom would cry if I died. She won’t respond to my texts. I told her that I was feeling borderline suicidal but she didn’t reply.

Why doesn’t she love me like when I was a little girl? Why isn’t she capable of it? She doesn’t want me anymore. I want to be loved and be good enough. I want to get off all of my medications but I can’t."
17,IS THERE A ANTIDEPRESSANT PILL OR DRUG I CAN TAKE TO RELIEVE MYSELF??,"I’m only 18F, and I don’t know where I can get meds to help me. I’m willing to whole spend my money just to relieve myself. 

I’m very tired."
18,Cardi-B Pepsi commercials sent me here not sure what im doing but i gave up on life bc of that nails on chalkboard voice having bitch,title.
19,Life is complete shit and I can’t keep pretending it’s okay,"I’ve been depressed on and off since high school. Ten years later and I’m still feeling horrible about life and living in general. I just think things would be so much easier if I’m gone. I constantly think about how I could do this: slicing my wrists, driving into a frozen lake, etc.

I’m constantly forgotten and unmemorable so I know that most people won’t remember or miss me.

I’m in a horrible marriage. We never spent time together. Recently I found someone I enjoy spending time with but I said we just had to be friends. Eventually he got tired of that and along with many other complicated issues, he’s randomly ghosted me without even giving me a reason.

I hate my job. I’m almost about to graduate but I just don’t want to go to school anymore, thinking about my last semester and the hour and a half commute I have to make to teach composition to a bunch of ungrateful kids who don’t care doesn’t help.

My friends left me and moved on. I barely hear from them anyone. People just tend to forget me in general. My husband doesn’t pay attention to me. He says I’m boring and all of our problems are my fault.

I can’t stop randomly crying all the time. The only reason I haven’t done anything yet is because I have a dog who was abused and I don’t want to leave him alone. He’s very attached to me and I know how sad he’ll be. But every day is worse and worse. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.

I don’t care about my life. I don’t care about what happens to me. I don’t care about my well being. I just want to die."
20,Tomorrow will be my last day alive.,I dont plan on going into 2020. Ive had probably one of the worst years in the worst decade imaginable. This year alone my dog had to be put down and my girlfriend broke up with me. I cant live with this anymore ive suffered to much in my 21 years alive and in those 21 years. I’ve had suicidal thoughts for nearly 11. I cant see myself myself ever being happy if every time im starting to feel some sort of happiness i get pushed back down. Ive decided im done
21,Relapsed today. Please help,"Posting on mobile, don’t know how to cross post. I relapsed after four months clean and it’s killing my fiancé. I have no idea what to do. I’m drinking heavily and want to hurt myself. Badly. Please someone help"
22,just don’t see any reason?,"i am not depressed or sad about my life, i just want to die and have been feeling this way ever since i really came in contact with the concept of suicide, but i haven’t actually gone through with it since i don’t want my mum or my brother to be sad about my death or make them feel like it’s their fault. my biggest wish is to just disappear with everyone i know just forgetting i ever existed. but i know that‘s impossible, so my plan is to go live in a different country for some time and gradually break contact with my family, kill myself there and just hope they never find out and will just hate me for disappearing like that. it’s really fucked up, but i just really don’t want to live this life anymore and don’t know what else to do about it."
23,My suicide will come soon,"I have made decision that I will take my own life once my mother passes away.  I wouldn't want her to feel guilty about my suicide because it's not her fault I am the way I am. So I will make sure the my mother is treated to a great funeral in her honor. From there I will take my own life because I don't value anything else in life. It's been tough dealing with this depression since I was young. I tried therapy and talking about it with others, but nothing seems to work. I'm tired of living day by day hoping that life will get better. The truth is not everybody is guaranteed a brighter day. It's time to be realistic with ourselves. For those who have a chance for better days, I am so glad you are able to find happiness. For the dying souls like myself, we await oblivion."
24,Pro tip: Just do it and get it over with.,"If you're here readign siht you might as well be nowhere.  
Wish i had the balls to do it when i was 16 now i have a ife and people who depend on me keeping me inthtis hsit hole every day.   
If you're a teen and contemplating suicide just fucking get it over with i'm 48 and i feel like i havce put myself through hell fo rnoe reason biut yo lease others. nothing but misery here it only gets worse with age. find a shotgun 12 gauge bucksht and point it at the bac of your spine through your mouth its a pain free way anf is 97% effective almost 0 chance of ending uo a vegy in a coma. see you in the abyss my feelow roop sluos"
25,Tomorrow.,"I think tomorrow will be the day. After my daughter goes to school. After my shift at work and after seeing the new Star Wars. I want to see the end of the trilogy beforehand. It will be the perfect ending. My mind is constantly on her. How I treated her, took her for granted, had a perfect family but was too fucking stupid to change, how much I loved her and how I still wish she was here. I just want the thoughts to stop. I want to stop having bad dreams every night, not being content with anything or having fun doing anything. I want it all to stop."
26,I don’t know what to do,"I want to kill myself on New Year’s Eve but I’m kinda scared. I have been planning this for about a year now. I really want to do it but I have doubts. What if I’m making a mistake and my life will sort itself out. What if I’ll be happy again. What if I’ll be successful. What if I find someone who will love me. What if I start accepting myself again for who I am. I am really confused and scared. I really want all the pain, the stress, the anxiety, the hatred towards me to end but it doesn’t it just gets worse every day. I went to psychologists. I went to psychiatrists. Nothing helped. They prescribed me Zoloft but my parents don’t let me take it. And I can’t go on for 1 more year without any medical help. Right now I have taken some plant based bullshit and it didn’t help me at all. I just want help right now. I want to live a normal life. I want to be able to go to school without having constant panic attacks. I want to go on the sidewalk without me wanting to throw myself at a car. I just want it all to end."
27,Today i leaened a lot. Yee leaen. Its good stuff bit detracts from the ultimate goal of toodays i leaerned a lot about it. here to share story. soory foor bad english i am euro germany proud no not abowt hitler or nazi but german prides.,"With new dlc and potus comunuioning tommarow i woood just lik too say""  


  


If your are going to suspend hang yourself via ps4 cord on a doornob. Remember to ejaculate BEFORE passing out.  
Otherwise whats the point amiright?  


Also avoid painkillers and booze as they only detract from that desirable feeling of almost dying.  
Also Also remember to uninstall BL3 and commit kurt cobain (heroin optional ofc)  
\*suggestion still valid even if over the age of 27\*"
28,How do i do this without hurting anyone?,"I mostly dont want to hurt my mom and brother. I think everyone else can make it just fine w out me. I know they care though, even though i do t talk to them much I know they care and mostly my mom would break from this. This doesn’t tend to help as the biggest reason why she would break is because she has her own mental health issues. I cant bear the thought of me being the reason why she quits but i know she would take it hard. I need to find a way to eliminate this being a factor."
29,I am very much alone,"I don't know what is wrong with me. This is kind of a last resort to let everything out. I don't have friends, I lie to people to make them think I have friends. I have no one to talk to. I feel alone and while I'm with people I hear a voice in my head screaming ""I can't do this anymore!"" ""I don't want to be here!"" ""Somebody make it stop!"". I don't have the guts to end myself self so I feel like I'll just keep suffering this endless life.  I've done my best so why can't my parents lay off me now. I've graduated and now I'm in college but I feel like my parents are so surprised like they never had that hope in the first place. I got a seasonal job and even then my mom didn't think I could get it. I can never satisfy my mom, everything I do pisses her off, She always says I'm lazy, I'm good for nothing, and I know she says it when she's mad but It really hurts. I feel useless, I don't know what I want to do in my life, I have friends but their not friends that would drive to my house when I'm having a crisis. I feel so alone. My mom isn't the emotional type and my dad ends up arguing with my mom. My parents are always taring my brain apart with their arguing, a simple thing like me buying a bag starts a heated argument with all of us. I end up getting most of the screams, I end up too scared to stay mad. I've heard so many stories of kids having arguments with parents and then something happens to the parents. So I suppress everything, I keep it inside."
30,Help! Friend in England!,I’m messaging someone I found on Reddit. They said they’ve attempted an overdose. But I live in America. Their Name is Sophie and they live in Bristol. I’ve heard stories of reddit saving lives before and I’m praying it can work this way too. Idk if I can call the England emergency services because I’m in America. But please someone if you can do something with that info please send help or call.
31,i deserve to die.,"i’ve convinced myself that this world would be better off without me. i’m a high school dropout, an ex-addict, a failure. i can’t even function at a simple job. not sure why i should go on another year."
32,I don’t want to see the upcoming decade.,"I don’t want to live to see it. I want to die.


I don’t think my mom would cry if I died. She won’t respond to my texts. I told her that I was feeling borderline suicidal but she didn’t reply.

Why doesn’t she love me like when I was a little girl? Why isn’t she capable of it? She doesn’t want me anymore. I want to be loved and be good enough. I want to get off all of my medications but I can’t."
33,Today I got a nice haircut,"I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I accepted my faith, I will leave happy. For years I've been complaining, whining about life, because I still had hope that some things will change. But they wont, and now I'm okay with that. I finally came to that realization after so long. I will take a bubble bath, shave, get dressed nicely and do it with a smile. In all my previous attempts I was drunk and drugged, crying and screaming, angry at the world and at myself because deep inside I knew I didnt have the courage to go through with it. But its different now. I found peace."
34,Why live here anymore,"I live in a shit apartment, me in the basement, with 4 other adults who claim to be my best friends, but even after a year still haven't given me much proof of that. The world is going to hell in a handbasket and not enough people seem to care at all. So why, with all the hostility in people, with all the people refusing to help fiz the planet, we'll be dead soon anyway right? Why not speed up the process? And why is it so looked down upon, we preach free will but when someone tries we stop them? It's just all starting to be too much for me to handle. And maybe that makes me weak, but I don't care anymore, I'm not here for any of you"
35,If I get high and take parcetomal 2hat will be the outcome. Will it numb the pain?,
36,I just need to vent a little bit,"I'm sorry if this is too long and rambly, and thank you for taking the time to read.

I genuinely cannot remember a time in which I wanted to be alive, but I only started to actively think about suicide a couple years ago and just started properly planning it this year. I haven't had any awful experiences or suffered any trauma, I just hate being alive and not having control over my own existence.

I'm 19 and I haven't done anything this year. By that I mean no work and no job. I finished high school last year, started Uni, didn't enjoy it and left after just a few months. Started working in a factory right after, absolutely hated it and left after 15 days. For the rest of the year I've done therapy, but my health insurance stopped covering it and I can no longer afford it. It haven't had that much of an effect on me anyways, but It was nice to have someone to talk to.

My parents are, justifiably, very upset that I'm not doing anything, and I understand why they would be, but I don't get enjoyment out of anything and doing any task feels like an enormous burden. In the rare instances I'll want to do something, I start overthinking and decide not to, because I fear failure. Little insignificant things will make me overly emotional and I cry at the very least once a week and think of suicide daily. I already have a plan, just need to save a little money. It's been like this the whole year.

My therapist says the reason why I feel so disconnected is that I never bothered to understand myself. I don't know what I like or I dislike, about anything, even simple things like food, sexuality, taste in music, whatever. I'm always neutral and numb. I don't know how to stop being like this and I would appreciate help."
37,I love it.,"First incident of something wrong that I can remember was when I was 8. I had gotten in trouble when the bullies were making fun of me. They got off free and I was punished. I went to a Muslim school but I'm not gonna say I believe in any god. During prayer time when I got in trouble, I tried my hardest not to cry. They would make fun of me. I tried and tried, I wasn't even sad, just... it was unfair,  but my body was. What I didn't realize at the time was that me and my body hated each other. I subconsciously knew it but it never clicked until much later. But the hate was there. My body made me cry, hundreds of times. Multiple times per day, the tears would flow, and more and more the kids realized what I was. A crybaby, that was me. The only kid everyone hated. I was stuck with the same kids for 9 years in that god forsaken school, from pre k to 8th grade. And every day without fail, I would cry. Before it was just nicknames, crybaby, then isolation, then before long I was getting beat up. In 7th grade i took a test for specialised schools and I got out after 8th grade. But it was too little and too late. 

But that day, in 3rd grade, I didn't cry. I tried something new. I superweapon to use against my body in the fight. I rubbed my head against the carpet softly. Then I put pressure, it started feeling good. I wasn't tearing anymore I... i was winning. I didn't stop though cuz I felt more tears coming. More pressure, rubbed faster, it started hurting more and more, burning. I didn't stop. Once the prayer was finished my teacher came to reprimand me more and she said. ""What happened"" I was scared at first, she hated me. She would go out her way to remind me how abhorred I am. I didn't know what she was talking about. She said ""your forehead, its bleeding"". I told her what I did. She started smiling, and asked me ""you did that because of me?"" I said no but she knew the answer. She walked away. The scar stayed for years and I was bullied more for it. I didn't care. I won. I hadn't used that weapon ever again after that day, well that changed today, but you'll see why. 

When I went to highschool I had made a pact with my body. Cry in private and I will devote all my time to sadness for you. Highschool was great at first but even though there was a pact, the war raged on. My body made me double think everything. Every kind action. Every word spoken in ear shot, ""are they talking about me?"". I asked myself that question every day 

Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and

Over.

Then.

Yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are yes they are 

Yes they are. 

I think. If I wasn't like this I could genuinely have been one of the most popular kids in school. That's how it was in the beginning. Everyone knew my name and they genuinely liked me. It was a first ever. And we fucked it. My body and I. 








I can't.

It hurts too much to think about it. 

To remember 

At least that's what I think.

My body has developed a weapon against me.

It used the pact to make me depressed.

The depression. The yearning for death. 

I loved it.

















The weapon. Its taken away my emotions. It won't let me feel anymore. Only strong emotions work. It used to hurt so much remembering these. I only used to remember them in my dreams. A few months ago. My body tested the weapon. I can't dream anymore. Nightmares were like candy to me. My body took that away. The sweat, the insomnia, the way you have to wake up and pretend everything is okay even though you cant stop thinking about it. 

I loved it. 

My body's ultimate weapon. It's taken what I lived the most from me. My depression. And all other emotions. I haven't cried in weeks. That was the first sign. I started whispering death threats to myself less and less. 

I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING. 

I DIDN'T FEEL A THING WRITING THIS. 

WHY.


...

I fought back. A few slams against the floor. My hair would cover the bruises. It worked for a bit. I was in control. But it wasn't enough. Today. 


I used the superweapon I unearthed so long ago.

The red wouldn't stop coming. 

I got scared.

I GOT SCARED. 

I FELT A RUSH OF EVERYTHING.

HOW WAS I TO HIDE THE BLOOD???

WHAT IF I GOT CAUGHT???

WHAT WOULD I DO NEXT?

I WASN'T FEELING ANYTHING UNTIL THIS MOMENT.

WRITING THIS 

EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE ACT 

I CAN FEEL MY HEART RACING 

THE BLOOD IS LEAVING MY BRAIN

it's gone. 

I can't feel anything. 




My wrist hurts."
38,I point my fingers to my head and pretend to shoot myself when I just can't handle a situation (TW I guess),"Yeah, whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed out, I'm pointing my fingers to my head or under my chin (depending on how much people might be able to see me) and just imagine what it would be like if I just shot myself right then and there. Also I keep repeating ""Just kill me, please, kill me"" when I'm alone and I have thoughts and feelings I can't handle. And damn, I would be lying if I said that I don't want to kill myself. I think about it every single day. In the morning when I get up, when I'm sitting in my lectures and when I go to bed in the evening. And it's not like I'm too much of a coward to do it (and I don't think you could ever be a coward when it comes to kill yourself, don't get me wrong), but I don't want to hurt my family and friends. It's the only thing that keeps me here. But I'm very, very sure that it won't keep me from trying forever. I know, I feel deep down that one day I will try it. I know that one day my fear of hurting the ones around me won't beat my desire to vanish and be free of all of this."
39,Need advice,"Today in therapy I told my therapist I was suicidal. I told him I have a loose plan when he asked, but I actually know exactly what I'm going to do, if I do do it. He was genuinely taken aback because I've been doing better since my last hospitalization in September. He almost called 911, but I was able to get ahold of my mom and she came home from work to be with me. I'm just confused by myself because I feel calm and not very suicidal now, a couple hours later since session. I kinda want the suicidal thoughts to come back because I don't want my therapist (or anyone else) to think I'm doing this for attention. *sigh 

I'm sure the suicidal thoughts will come back soon, but I'm just questions my motives behind the thoughts. Why do I want to kill myself? At the end of session before I left, he kinda said to himself/me that he just didn't understand why I wanted to kill myself. I guess I'm starting to question that too, but I still want to go through with my plan if I can, even if it's to just feel the noose around my neck."
40,I just walked into the closet where the gun is and stared at it for 20 minutes.,I'm afraid to go to sleep because I think i'll somehow sleepwalk to the closet and kill myself. Does anyone have any cool stories or something to cheer me up? This has actually been the lowest i've ever been.
41,I'll probably kill myself if my future SO cheats on me.,"Too many cheating stories I've read and recently I've discovered some of the worst ones. I can feel the victim's pain and if I got cheated on I definitely won't be able to handle the pain. The thought of the woman I wanted to spend my life with decides to have an affair with another man and feel no remorse about it. Nope. I can't do it. What's worse is that if we already had kids when she cheated. She not only hurt me but ruined our kid's lives. I can't live with the fact that the love of my life and the mother of my children was actually a heartless monster. It breaks my heart and makes me furious that this possibility is likely gonna happen! Well, that's just what I think. It feels like everyone's a cheater, I know I'm being irrational but it's seriously hard for me to think rationally. I'm considering two options now: Either never enter or relationship or commit suicide if my wife/girlfriend does cheat on me."
42,Im so tired,"Ive wanted to kill myself for about nine years now. On and off with increasing intensity as I grow older. Im tired. I want help i genuinely wish to not feel this way or see things the way I do but i cannot find it. Im starting to think that feeling this way is just the way im meant to go. Im meant to die like this. My insurance doesn’t cover the only mental health place I found. The other one is inpatient and i cant have that. Ive set a date and for the first time I feel like I may be disconnected enough to actually do it. My biggest fear is hurting people when I die but thinking about that only makes me angry, frustrated and left feeling stuck. My date is in the middle if July but im starting to feel like I wont make it past christmas."
43,why?,"why continue living on in this reality that holds no meaning? how is it that people can provide a sense of meaning to their existence and receive fulfillment from it? how can people go about life and not feel the urge to end it every day? i just cannot comprehend it, it's as if i'm missing something important. why can i not grasp the concept of wanting to live an accomplished life? i'm told i'm only 16 and i have my entire life ahead of me, yet i just don't see why i should care. it's almost like inherently most people care about living their life to the fullest, while i simply don't have that quality. if i were to die right now i wouldn't feel happy nor sad, almost indifferent towards it. i hate thinking like this because i know it hurts the people that care about me so much. what will it take for me to care about living? can someone please tell me?"
44,I hate waking up every day,"From the moment that I wake up to the moment that I fall asleep, all I ever think about is wanting to end my life. I haven't done it yet because I'm too scared of surviving somehow, but lately I've been considering just doing it anyways and hoping I succeed. There is nothing I enjoy doing, the games I play only serve as a distraction from how much I want to end my life, but those distractions can only last so long. I have no aspirations in life, I feel so lonely no matter where I am, I have nothing left to lose. I've tried getting help before, but the treatment didnt work so here i am now. I know that the way I feel is not anyone else's fault, but I just don't want to live anymore. I don't know how my friends or family will feel when I die, but I cannot go through this mental pain anymore."
46,Can you give me all ways of suicide you know,I'm 15 I can't buy alot but I know how to drive a car but badly but I'm looking for method that doesn't hurt others and if I live won't hurt my stomach
47,My friend’s lives and friendships are in ruins and it’s all my fault.,I need to stab something to death. Honestly I wish I could just kill my friends to end their suffering. I’ll kill them and then myself. Yeah that sounds right. I need to kill something now. Everything is falling. I need to hurt myself too. I just wanna stab something to death. It’s all my fault. Everything is ruined and it’s all my fault. I just want to kill everyone and make this stop.
49,I don’t know what to put for a title on here,"I mean, I never thought it would get to this point, not last year or anything, everything was fine.
But then everything slowly declined to a point where I’m just slowly beginning to lose my grip and stop caring. My repetition of ‘slowly’ and the sibilants was deliberate there, because it wasn’t fast at all - it was just painful and slow.
I’m 16 but I’ve felt like this since the age of 11, I’ve never spoken about how I feel in any way. I’m stuck in the wrong body; I just tell everyone I’m happy with who I am, messed up brain, dull and monotonous life.
If it wasn’t for my best friend who lives across the border and other couple of super close friends, and family, I would have done it. And this makes me feel like shit because I have so many people yet there are other people who don’t.
I’m so done."
50,I wish I would have a happy family that loves me,
51,I have noone else I can talk to about this.,"I'm sure to you all I'm just another suicidal person on the Internet but to me, you guys are the only place I can turn to.

My marriage is falling apart right in front of me and it's too far gone to save. I love my husband more than words can express but he certainly doesn't feel the same for me. I cannot turn to him for support and I have noone else in my life that will understand. Noone knows that I've been thinking of killing myself near daily for the last week now.

It's not the first time in my life I've had these thoughts but it is the first time I have felt this hopeless. I really have nothing to live for. I don't know what to do anymore.

My husband says all I do is bother him and that I'm an evil person, I believe him. So, at least if I die, he will be free to find someone he can love back. He is the only person I care about in life and I do nothing but make him miserable. 

I don't really know what else to say to be honest. I've just lost the will to continue really. Thanks for reading. I appreciate it."
52,Life is like a nightmare except without the option to wake up from,I don't know what's my purpose and I feel disconnected from the world.
53,Jotting down my reasons,"Hi there, just writing down some things that make me feel the way I do.

 I am 26 years old with no real future, I have dropped out of university twice, I have no friends except for my online friends. I have never really slotted in with my peer group for as long as I can remember, even when I was a little kid &lt;10 years old I would play football with the younger ones instead of people in my year, I moved around as a child, a lot, we were moving away from my abusive, heroin addicted dad, i cant count on two hands the amount of schools I've been in, i was always the new boy and i dotn know, just became a social recluse. if i was ever bullied or picked on and i dint fight back i remember my dad promising i would get a beating twice as bad, I didn't mind getting physically picked on by boys as i could still at least fight back. probably the worst type of bullying was permanent mental abuse, i remember the first time i was in high school, i was being picked on even by the ""nerds"" , taking the mick out of where I lived (it was a council estate) saying that I smell of b.o ( i still bathed every day ) but one time this boy  Leon i had never even SEEN before who was a few years above made up a rumour that I sucked his dick? the class clowns who were always the ones picking on me john and cant remember the other ones name started spreading this too, i remember being chased into the toilets cryign my eyes out and then they realised what kind of effect it had on me, did it stop it?no, i was followed home one day when i was walking my little brother and sister back to the house and these boys are trying to tell my siblings what I supposedly done, now stuff like that was kind of taboo for me so you can imagine how disgustingly angry I was, I was prepared to kill them. round about this time is when i was first having my suicidal thoughts. we moved yet again and i actually ended up at a ""decent"" school, i was still picked on there for the first two years but aftrer that I sort of became one of ""them"" and accepted. now that doesnt mean  i had friends, i just wasnt tormented. Round about when I was finishing high school I legtimately felt on top of the world, I got good grades to get uncodinitionals into good universities, I was phtysically fit, I felt I looked good and I went thinking I could ""reinvent"" myself for university, so that I wouldnt be seen as a timid guy, I wanted to be outgoing,liked, be able to have conversations with people without it being awkward. 1 week into my time at uni, staying at dorms I was at a party and I have NEVER been drunk before, i dont even  think i drank a lot but at some point I woke up with a girl trying to ride me, couldn't do anything i felt legitimately powerless against it. about a week after this I just leave dorms altogether and try to commute to university, I end up dropping out after a few months. if i rewind a few years to before I was in highscool I do remember my next door neighbours daughter one time tried it on with me, not sure what age I was maybe 11 and she is atleast 16, we were camping in her backgarden with my brother and sister, i remembr it clearly, we were watching spy kids and she is rubbing my dick, im sort of confused at thsi time because i dont even know anything about that, i had never had  an erection before. just added this in there since i suppose it might influenced me mentally in some way, after i dropped out of university I gained a lot of weight, like i went from physically fit to having a spare tire,to having fat legs and a fat face. i tried going to uni again but i had lost all motivation that i had from when i finished high school. anyway after this point I sort of just went into limbo mode, I worked at a few places, put on a smile and got paid at the end of the day but felt like im not really going anywhere. ive kind of come to the realisation that i was never actually meant to live a normal or long life, i just cant see it happening. this christmas will be my last i have spent a lot of money on gifts for my close family i have got them meaningful gifts that ihope they will appreciate. I am this close already to dying but i think i will wait till new year or soon after christmas. Anyways just writing all of this down here so that I can come back to it later. I am not angry , sad, depressed anymore, its set in stone and as im tpyoing this i feel kind of at ease."
54,My friends lives are in ruins and it’s all my fault.,I need to stab something to death. Honestly I wish I could just kill my friends to end their suffering. I’ll kill them and then myself. Yeah that sounds right. I need to kill something now. Everything is falling. I need to hurt myself too. I just wanna stab something to death. It’s all my fault. Everything is ruined and it’s all my fault. I just want to kill everyone and make this stop.
55,So much guilt...,"My youngest wrote to Santa. She said sure she'd like presents but what she really wants is for her mom to feel better. She figures if anyone can do it, its him. Like I've tried my hardest to hide it. Tbh I thought I was doing good hiding it. I think the closer I get, the less I can hide it."
56,Just need to write out my thoughts,"I just need to get this out there somewhere. 

I've never considered myself suicidal before. I've had depression that responds better to me having healthy habits (showering, keeping a clean home, exercising, etc) than medication, which made me and my therapist question... is it even clinical depression or just a response to bad habits? 

I've had a rough few days for almost no reason. The holidays maybe? I've been trying to shut my mind up with booze every night this week. Which actually works pretty well. But I need to be sober for work. 

Anyway, the reason I'm here, I just out of nowhere at work, in the midst of thinking pretty negative thoughts and in general feeling like shit, I had a stray thought of ""what if I just killed myself?"" 

It's not the first time I've thought it, but it is the first time I've thought it and felt peace from it. It usually makes me grimace a bit. This time when I thought it, I felt my mind be quiet for the first time in weeks, and a kind of warm almost pleasurable sensation fill my chest and spread throughout my body. 

I don't think I'm an immediate risk to myself, but I'm not sure that it's a good sign to react to that thought in this way. I'm not seeing a therapist right now, because my health insurance changed and I had to dump mine. Maybe I should seek that out."
57,I'm fuckkmg tired of living,"I go outside and feel strange. 

I have no friends or job.

I hate my life. 

I failed at everything. Where is God......

Please just fuckkmg kill me ok?"
58,dead,"i’m very scared of my life i don’t hve the balls to kill myself but at the same time i really want to. I’ve spent the last several years alone. Isolated. I have no one, no friends small family. I won’t hurt myself but i just want to say i’m sorry for everything i’ve done in this world. I am. I’m trying to be better."
59,Can't do this anymore,"I don't know what to do, guys. 
I don't know what to do."
60,I’m so fucking angry that I can’t even process it,"If you google ‘easiest ways to commit suicide’ the results are nothing but a bunch of suicide hotline bullshit. What the fuck? I just want to die quickly and peacefully and in a way that will not endanger or traumatize others and they want to give me this shit instead? They want me to talk to people that are literally paid to pretend that they give a shit about me and my problems (when they don’t, and could not give less of a shit whether I live or die) and act like that’s a reasonable replacement for a healthy life or a reason to keep living?

Disgusting. Deplorable. I can’t even put it into words how angry I am. I guess I’ll die slowly and painfully by taking a bunch of pills anyway, which is what I was going to do in the first place, but was hoping I could do it without being in agony. Guess not, but it’s better than being alive in this life. Peace"
61,i’m going to do it,"i have no one else to tell so i guess if one of my friends ever know i did this, i love you and it’s not your fault, i don’t know what i’m doing yeah goodbye i guess"
62,I Don't Want To Keep Going Anymore.," 

I feel like my life has gone to total shit and I don't even know where to start. Very sorry for what I'm sure will be a very long and post, but I need to get this out.

I recently ended a 10+ year marriage. My ex is an incredibly cruel and vindictive person who has gone after friends and family with lies, slander, and harassment, even going so far as to email their employers trying to get them fired. I have two children and I'm fairly certain that my oldest \[12\] doesn't really care for me. My ex has tried to drag me through the mud in every possible way, including publicly claiming I had an affair *(I didn't)*, that I mentally and physically abuse my children *(I don't)*, and much more. She is extremely manipulative and has been for a large portion of our marriage, which has led me to develop severe anxiety/depression issues, and I can't trust people at face value anymore without always trying to figure what their ulterior motives are or how they're trying to hurt me.

I can count my friends on one hand and don't even need all 5 fingers. I'm incredibly anti-social in that being around people, especially strangers or being around lots of people even with friends, is unbelievably anxiety inducing. This has me feeling like I will never make new friends, I will never experience someone elses love, etc. because I can't bring myself to even think about trying to meet new people due to the anxiety it causes.

I nearly attempted suicide in April of 2016 after losing two jobs in about a 6 month period. I had a gun to my head and was counting down from 10 when someone called me with 2 seconds to go. This person had no particular reason for calling other than they felt they needed to check in on me. I took this as a sign, but with everything else that has gone on since, hindsight is always 20/20 as they say. Not one single day has gone by without very seriously thinking about finishing the job.

I have one friend \[female\] who is far and away the most incredible person I have ever met and will ever meet. She is kind, gentle, open-minded, understanding, able to talk about literally anything including things no one else would even think about discussing with me, has been in a similar place mentally and emotionally to where I'm at and can connect/empathize with me on a deep, deep level, and I love her more than I love anyone else on Earth, even more than my own children. I can't possibly begin to describe how special and important this person is to me, I just can't do it justice. On top of this and least importantly, she is 10/10 physically attractive. Unfortunately, she is FAR beyond my league and I'm quite sure that she has zero interest in a relationship with me, although to be honest I've never talked to her about it because I'm far too chicken and because rejection from her would be the only reason I need to immediately take my own life. I can't tell her any of this because there's no way I could handle the guilt I would feel for basically saying ""If I can't have you then I'm going to kill myself"", which totally isn't my intention but that's how it would be interpreted. If by some one-in-a-million cosmic alignment I end up meeting another girl and develop feelings for her, I know I will never, EVER, be able to fully enjoy a relationship without this other friend in the back of my mind. She has set the bar higher than anyone could possibly reach, and because of this I will forever be disappointed. I will always live with that longing in my heart for something I know I'll never have and if I end up in this position, I will feel like the ultimate piece of shit for bringing someone into a relationship with me because I will never feel content and they'll never know it.

I have the most fucked up dreams imaginable, usually involving extreme violence and death. As an example, I once had a dream where my youngest son \[3\] needed a haircut. It was the middle of the night with light from a full moon coming through very thin, almost translucent white curtains. He sits down on a tall, swiveling barstool and I have a pair of scissors in my hand and I begin to cut his hair. As I turn the stool, he has changed. His eyes are sunken into his head, skin is sickly pale, veiny, and overall gross *(think Exorcist type stuff but not exactly the same)*. In a deep and disgusting voice that can't be described, he begins saying awful, awful things. I continue to cut his hair but I'm not looking, and when I look down, I'm trying to cut through his neck as if it was nothing more than a thick, meaty piece of paper and I'm about halfway through. He has returned to his normal, sweet self and looks me with his big blue eyes and through the blood and severed windpipe manages to gurgle out, ""It's OK daddy. I'm sorry daddy. I love you daddy"", at which point I wake up screaming bloody murder and usually try to stumble into the shower where I just lay on the floor and cry for so long the water goes ice cold and I don't even care. This is only one of countless examples.

I ended up in the hospital in October for what I thought was appendicitis *(turned out not to be)*. I'm the kind of guy that won't go to the doctor unless I'm on the verge of death, let alone the hospital. I had moderately high pain in my stomach/side for multiple days before it spiked very hard and fast, prompting me to go to the ER. I thought my appendix had burst, which can be fatal. Do you know who came to the hospital to see me? Nobody. How many people come check on me when I stop replying to text messages, knowing that I'm in a very bad place? None. When I do try to communicate to someone that I need help or that I'm in a very unsafe place mentally *(which I'm not great at and I realize that could be contributing to the problem)*, not a single person says anything more than ""That sucks man"", ""I hope you have a better day"", ""I'm sorry to hear that"", etc.. There is literally no one in my life that cares. I bet money that I could kill myself at home and no one, and I mean NO ONE, would find out for at least 3-4 weeks because that's how long it would take before someone bothered to check on me after not hearing from me for that long. I would haul myself out of bed at the drop of a hat with zero hesitation and go to someones house at literally any time, middle of the night or not, if I thought they needed me. I have not one person in my life that would do that for me, and that hurts.

I don't want to live life this way. I cannot talk to friends/family about this. I don't have that kind of relationship with them and none of them will respond positively to any of what I've mentioned here *(I have talked about some of this with Female Friend Prime but I can't discuss most of it for what I feel are fairly obvious reasons based on what I've already said).* The thought of being gone and never having to deal with these things again is incredibly appealing and is one of the only things I have left that makes me feel better when things somehow yet inevitably get harder than they already are. I have done countless hours of research and feel that I could easily pull it off with little to no pain, but I can't say for certain why I haven't done it already. I crave friendship/relationship, particularly female friendship/relationship *(nothing creepy or gross, it's just the way it is for some reason)*. I just want to sit on the couch and cuddle. I want someone to hold my hand. I want someone to run their fingers through my hair and other stereotypical comfort stuff like that, but I have way too much anxiety and anti-socialness(?) to let someone in like that, let alone get out and meet anyone. In my head this makes no sense, I'm torturing myself by craving what I know I can't get.

To be honest, I'm unsure of exactly why I've written this. My best answer is really probably just to get it all off my chest. As I've said already, I can't tell anyone about this so I guess this is my attempt to let someone know before I can't anymore. I don't know what I expect anyone to say or do in an online setting, so I supposed I don't really expect anything. I have enough people in my life that don't care about me that I don't want to PAY someone else not to care *(therapist),* so I suppose this is the next closest thing. On top of that I'm terrified of telling a therapist something that would have me admitted or arrested, so I know I couldn't be honest with them anyway.

This is what hopelessness feels like. I'm sorry to everyone."
63,I don’t want help,"Every fucking time I google anything mildly suicidal sounding I get bombarded with all this shit. I just wanna be in the company of people like me. Read our discussions, ideas. I just see no point to living in this world the way it is. I want to die. I don’t want any fucks trying to fuck with my head with their anti-depressants, brainwash me into believing that everything’s okay, etc."
64,i lost control,"all i ever wanted was full and absolute control over my life. from very young age, it was obvious to me that nothing else mattered other than being in charge of yourself, and the things that enter your life.

*sadly, including the people that enter your life*

i pushed this belief system onto **everything**. from my insanely impossible daily routine that pushes me to do so much work and leaves me feeling like i did absolutely nothing nonetheless;

 over my body and the way it looked, felt, behaved,  the things i consumed, and didnt consume ( i developed an ED trying to control the food in my life);

to the emotions and behaviours of myself and the people that entered my life.

my whole life is slowly dancing around the idea of having power over everything. always was and still is.

throughout these years that ive been alive for, ive come to terms with many things that i am. and in fact, that made me feel even more in charge, feeding my idea of being better than everyone else. i **genuinely** thought i had the rope in my hands, and i could play with it however i want.

today - it hit me like a ton of bricks.

i wont talk about it. i wont vent about it. i wont think about it. but today, on the 18th of December 2019, i realized that i lost the only thing i care about.

**control**

and i want it back"
65,Sad,I really thought this page will help me kill myself. I badly want it.
66,I promise im trying,"Ive been actively trying to pull myself out of the hole of depression and suicidal shit. But it's honestly really hard. Ive been dealing with self harm for ten years, suicidal tendencies for eight.

I know im loved. I know i dont need to be perfect. I dont need validation to be a good person. I dont need to be the top dog to be great.

It feels like a bunch of vines have grown around me. When i was younger i never really understood how to cut free, nor did anyone really try to pull me out. Now that im older and stronger, i am starting to cut myself out if it. Changing my mindset (despite how hard it is) and meds do help. They serve as a form of scissors. It really does help. It makes things easier to get free.

But the vines keep growing back and my arms are getting tired from fighting it alone because i stopped calling for help. I stopped opening up to people.

It also feels like the vines have been my prison for so long its become my home. The familiar pulling downwards and the pain nearly everyday. It's horrible but i keep finding myself back there.

Im so tired. I know i have all the reasons to press on but i want to give up. I know i have everything i could've ever wanted but i still feel empty and bare. I know im not the best and i dont need to put expectations but i still feel like a fucking failure.

Am i just doomed to never recover? Are people just wasting their time in trying to help me?

I hate it so much i dont even totally understand why i keep doing it.

Everyday i wake up and it feels like there's a timer of sorts above my head. [??? Days before his suicide.] the numbers keep changing, sometimes its so blurred in my head i cant think of when ill kill myself.

Whenever i pass by someone i know - most of them smile and seem so excited to see me. They joke around with me. I know they care about me, even just a little bit. Then my mind goes to ""imagine how hard they'll cry when you kill yourself."" it hurts my chest yet it feels oddly satisfying at the same time. It probably means I just really wish people cared a little more or something. I dont know.

Everytime i fuck up even just a little bit my mind jumps to overdosing or hanging myself. I fantasize about the panic that settles in when people cant wake me up. When im brought to the hospital and pronounced dead. Everyone's reactions after. But i know its fucked up to think about.

I really want to die. I dont like this limbo of recovering and relapsing. I dont like feeling like shit all the time yet trucking through. I know life wasn't meant to be easy but i just really dont want to wake up anymore.

Im so happy with how things are turning out. I have an absolutely fucking amazing boyfriend, my family are becoming warmer little by little, i have good grades, im the head of an organization, and i have a lot of new friends. I am happy. Yet i still want to fucking die.

One day i know I'll look back on this and laugh at myself. I'll be stronger,probably. One day I'll be okay. But right now it hurts and being hopeful feels bleak.

I promise im trying."
68,"Increasing thoughts of driving off a cliff. I don’t know what to do, but I just failed a class and since then the thoughts seem more frequent. It’s gotten so bad I don’t even feel like playing video games and have been trying to distract myself with Mandalorian and YouTube.",Nothing is working. And the cliff is still calling me.
69,Question,"Hi guys, hope you are all doing kind of okay. I have a question for people who have witnessed suicide from upclose. 
English is not my native language, so i'm not sure if i am formulating it well. But if for example, a relative took his own life, what has been the worst thing you had to go through? Someone had to clean up their house, contact workplaces, the funeral had to be arranged, etc... What has been the worst part for you to go through after the person killed themselves? Was there anything the person could have done differently so that the loss would have been easier for you?"
70,Probably not gonna be alive in around 3 months,"I’ve been planning this for a while. After a bunch of stupid shit I did caused my best friend to leave me. I’m currently trying to get her back but I don’t think I’m trying hard enough honestly. Talking to her has made me happy in the past and she’s really made me feel better than ever before. She’s also the only thing that’s ever given me hope in life. I want that hope back, whether or not it’s with her, but I’d really prefer it to be with her. If I don’t have any hope in 3 months from now, then I’m gone. The reason I chose that specific date is because that’s when scores come out for the SAT I’m taking. My parents and probably even my friends (including her) will probably all think I did it over my SAT score since I’ll probably do worse than what I’m aiming for. Already have a shit ton of methods planned and I’m already gonna start writing a will soon (I know it won’t be legally binding but I doubt my parents will refuse to carry out my death wish).
Unrelated: in my will, I’m distributing all my savings (currently around $300) and my valuable possessions among my closest friends and probably also my younger brother since there’s really not much I can leave for my parents or the rest of my extended family."
71,"I drank almost all of my cough syrup, why am I not dead yet?",Is cough syrup a stupid method? Or should I try something else. The most it makes me feel is dizzy
72,Life insurance and suicide,"I know there is usually 2 year suicide clause in life insurance policy where your life insurance won't pay for first 2 years of a policy. Also, there is something called Conversion, where you can convert a group life insurance into individual whole life insurance. In those situation, does the suicide clause get reset or you get credit for the period you had the previous group life? Appreciate intention to help. I am looking for facts only."
74,suicide suicide suicide,"it’s all within my thoughts
within my blood, my rage, my regret and humiliation 

I can no longer just self harm. I want deeper i want to fucking perish. Sober or not i can no longer escape the thoughts that have fulfilled my brain to accept that the one thing i need to do is kill myself

The years wasted to depression, amongst other mental struggles can no longer keep me here. I’ve become a monster. There is so much rage filled within me. It feels like a cancer. I feel like a cancer and i can no longer hold myself in this reality.

It hurts to breathe, to be, i’m tired of the dead numbness to the crying myself physically ill. 

I just comfort and comfort is ending my life. i need someone to tell me that’s okay. that i deserve to find some peace. and it can’t be on earth as i’m  struggling to maintain a reality in this disgusting body."
75,Should I kill myself?,"I’m thinking about committing suicide. Should I do it? If yes, how should I end my worthless life?"
76,A few weeks until my suicide date.,"The title says it all, there is only a few weeks until I finally do it. Unless something extraordinary happens by then... which I don't believe it will but who knows. For a long time I've been wanting this and it's weird because I'm a coward like there have been at least more than 100 times that I've held something or looked at something and thought ""I'M GONNA DO IT"" but my cowardness stops me. But enough is enough, I just wish I have courage to go through with it because I'm tired of it all."
77,I don't want to wake up.,"Hey everybody,

I'm 22, male. I don't want to live anymore. I want to grant the family who loves me so much a last happy christmas and new year, before I end it. I tried hard and worked hard, but it's over. I don't even know why I would post this. I don't think I want to die, I want another life, a fresh start, a fucking factory reset. I tried to contact a shrink, she hasn't awnsered yet. I don't even know what or how to tell her anything. I love my mother and my sister so much, they have never dissappointed me, but my life is over, it's done. I have made my peace, said goodbye to any dream I have ever had, my life will never be good or happy or just normal again. No one will ever love me again."
78,Dr visit / help,"I had a dr visit and said I can’t talk to my physiologist coz I can’t open up, so they recommended I do the online version. And I was pretty messed up when I did it and ticked I plan to hurt myself, now they’re going to tell my drs. I’m worried about what they will do... I’ve told them I get suicidal thoughts but have always said I won’t act on them.. they can’t do anything to me can they??"
79,23rd Dec,"I don't want to be cringy, but it seems like a perfect date. The weather is gonna be shitty and it may be the only way to influence some people to wake the fuck up.

I don't want to be around ignorant people anymore.
It seems like most of people just like being selfish assholes, who seek for other selfish assholes to form a clan/ sect/ tribe of similar thinking motherfuckers. 
I just can't.... All of the facepalms I gave myself have damaged my brain. Goodbye."
80,I will fall to suicide,"I feel like exploding
I am in disgust with myself
I will never meet my expectations
I ruin all of my relationships and push away those I love the most because I am an idiot 
I was touched and groomed by my mother when I had just turned a teenager...and by my father when I was slightly younger
They are devout Christians
I love them but this pain and resentment I feel is destroying me
I want to end my life because I feel tainted
I want to cry for hours and yell and spite God because I am so angry
I am sorry"
81,Just too hard to do it,"Recently I started my freshman year of high school. In November I slowly realized my friends were ditching me to be popular. It hit me hard but I got over it for a little. It came back around a week ago, a heaviness in my heart knowing they made friends so easily and when I try it just fails miserably. I recently got suicidal thoughts 3 days ago just by looking at one of my ex friends in a group of people while I was by myself just standing there. During lunch I walk around the school by myself trying to keep busy. I haven’t harmed myself too bad as to not draw attention to others and seem like “oh he’s just cutting himself for attention oh what a dick”. I just wanted to confess this here as no one in my school has reddit and I guess it’s safe here. Apologies for not formatting right as I’m on mobile."
82,I’m going to spend the remainder of life alone and I can’t handle the thought.,"I’ve never been good at making friends. I have no friends (not even acquaintances) and I have never made any friend in school. I’m 18. I was always solitary, never been in a relationship, and it’s been a solid 5 years since I’ve hugged anyone. I feel so alone all the time, but having autism/other social and emotional problems makes it hard for me to make friends. I don’t go to school, I stopped going last year. I haven’t let my house this year to go outside other than to go to the supermarket. I had the thought that I will be alone forever and I feel so sad. It makes me sad because I know I could be a good friend if I was just given the chance. But most people don’t overlook those social differences and are quick to judge me. I feel so empty inside. I might hang myself today. I say might because I’m going to try but I don’t know if I’ll have the courage. I really hope I do. I don’t know if these words here are the last ones I ever write to anyone. I don’t get messages from anyone so if so, that’s true. I can’t even get myself to write a suicide note because it’s too hard. I kept thinking about how once my parents die I could die and most not likely be noticed until a year or even more after my death. help me."
83,I think I am going to kill myself this friday,"I already bought my ticket for the new star wars movie and Im planning on killing myself after watching. I love star wars and Ive been delaying my suicide to watch the conclusion of the saga. If I don't kill myself this friday next deadline is my 21th birthday in february.  
  
I already had a lot of reasons to kill myself but recently my exam results for the 17th century prose and poetry class were announced and I got 11/100 meaning I need to get 76/100 at the finals to not fail at this class which is just impossible. I've already failed at 2 classes so my education life that I wasn't very hopeful from the begining just got a lot harder and also my parents are going to be pissed.  
  
This is just one of the reasons ofc, if you wanna hear I have 1000 more in the back of my mind.  
  
**I really dont wanna kill myself but the life that im living is really hard in a very specific way and I cant handle it by myself.**"
84,njhnjbjkokkhhbvfxzz,my family is shitty and everyone expects me to die and fucking fail so I want to drown myself
85,I wrote my notes today.,"Originally I was going to wait, but I found the key to our gun safe. I plan on doing it as soon as I am alone in the house. I hid the notes in a little box inside a hidden drawer in my closet. I just have to pull them out and shoot."
86,How do I admit myself to a mental hospital?,I feel I’m in serious danger of hurting myself and I am wondering how I can accomplish this.
87,"I drank so much cough syrup in the past 24 hours, hoping that it would kill me but I’m still here 🙃🙃🙃",I know I’m a failure but to be a failure at killing my self is soo fucking frustrating.I can’t do anything right
88,I don't know if I'm even meant to survive,"I've had a really rough life. I moved several times throughout my childhood. My father had a stroke when I was five and passed away when I was eleven, on his birthday no less. I was bullied relentlessly for a variety of reasons. I never seemed to have a good group of friends and no one ever wanted me. My mother remarried to someone who wound up being verbally/emotionally abusive and sometimes physically abusive. My mom passed away when I was twenty after not having much of a teenage experience--no dating, no prom, no nothing because no one wanted me around. I then moved in with my grandmother and turns out she was also verbally abusive. 

This year I tried to get away from all of that as much as I could even though I lost a stable income. I learned how to drive, bought a car, and moved in with my best friend across the country but I've had trouble finding stability. I haven't been able to find work even though I've applied for every job I could and I haven't been able to find social outlets or income and I think I'm making my best friend hate &amp; resent me. My family isn't doing much to help me no matter how much I ask. 

When my mom died my family just expected me to know how to function in the world but no one taught me how to be independent. I grew up with a horrible man who screamed at me every day go grow up and learn how to support myself instead of actually teaching me how. I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm not supposed to be alive. I know I need a job for work and I keep trying to get hired but part of me is afraid to get a job because I feel like I'll fuck that up too because I'm 25 and don't know how to do anything. 

I tried to kill myself a couple of times before to try and get away from my step dad and I really think my survival is a mistake. I'm not meant to be here. I'm not strong enough. No one has ever wanted me, I'm gross and ugly and disgusting and no one wants to help me or have me around. 

I would really just like to know what stability feels like for once in my life."
89,Why do people have to be so mean?,"Do you ever feel like you don’t belong in this world? Like you don’t fit in with anyone and anything. Like yeah you may have friends and your able to socialize and have a good time, but reality is just so surreal. It’s like I’m looking at everything/other people through a glass mirror, ripples and waves of water.....and I just can’t touch them or their reality. People have become so cruel nowadays. So selfish. Everyone’s vibe just throws me off. I don’t know why but I just get so upset interacting with most people because I feel like most people aren’t good people.....and it’s not right to predetermine or judge others but I feel like most of the time I’m right. I’m not saying I’m perfect.....but I do feel like my heart is pure, I just want the best for others.....not only others but for myself as well. I want the world to succeed and for everyone to find peace. I want world peace. I want people to look out for each other and to take care of each other.....but that’s not how the world is. Everything is so cold and harsh and people only care about themselves and it just really bothers me. It makes me feel suicidal.....almost like I’m just thinking to myself “wow, these are the people I’m going to have reside with during my time on earth, these are the fellow souls that are here with me.” And that is just so depressing man. I can’t take it anymore."
91,Honestly feel like overdoseing.,
92,i honestly don’t feel alive anymore,"i had my fun, i had the bestest friends and managed to lose them, i smoked my first cigarette, i drank my first beer, i tried drugs, i travelled etc. basically what i’m trying to say is i feel like i’ve already lived my life, and now i feel like a 90 year old dude, waiting for his death. just about 2 years ago, i actually enjoyed being alive, i’d do something different everyday, i’d go clubbing with friends, go shopping with my girlfriend, i’d get in trouble and feel the adrenaline of danger, i’d play sports with my friends, i’d go to sleep everyday wondering what crazy stupid things we’d do tomorrow.
but now, it’s all gone. i no longer have any friends, i no longer have my girlfriend, i don’t even know myself anymore, losing the most important people in my life changed me dearly, i’m no longer that outgoing, social, lively person anymore, i’m just this shy, introverted loner who is always alone. everyday is exactly the same, i just wake up, go to school, sit in classes, get home, close the curtains, eat and watch tv, sleep, repeat.
so all of this got me thinking, what if my time here is done? i mean come on, what am i living for anyway? i already lived my life, there’s nothing left to do. i’m so tired of everything anymore, i’m so tired of this numbness, i’m so tired of missing my old self. i’ve been getting this suicidal thoughts lately, i don’t know if i’m actually going to do it, but one thing i know for sure is that, i just want this pain to go away."
93,Can you send me some love?,"Hello, I just wanted to talk about my suicidal thoughts that have been running through my head recently. i've planned a series of things that might make me happy, unfortunately they didn't work,and my only hope left is reddit. i've been really stressed out,usually threatened,betrayed by close people and even bullied and beaten. i'm Trying to be happy everyday i can, but it's not working anymore, there's no reason for me to continue on living anymore. 


I'm only asking for some love to give me hope, so i know that some people are cheering for me. Thank you for listening to my story"
94,I almost got into a car crash this morning,"I dont remember how I felt. But it doesn't make me want to live. Instead, I secretly for every car I seento malfunction and to run into me."
95,I feel like I could to anything without remorse and it's boring me to the point I'm about to kill myself,"Hey everyone, hope you all doing good

I'm a guy from southern Brazil currently living in Paraguay because of my dad's job, and it's great, the people is nice, but lately I've been super bored of everything, I started reading books on human behavior, charisma, dating and social interactions since last year and it's been awesome, I started practicing with people on VR games first and figured out I could make people feel the way I wanted to, like how a neural network would learn what works and what not, and it's crazy.

I started acting my ways out and even though the 7 habits of effective people talk about never using superficial charisma and easy ways, I get some sort of video-game cheating high when I turn the situation how I want to, I got a girl to end up leaving her boyfriend for me without me even telling her, and ended breaking up with her 4 times, on the third I wanted more of her so I started talking to her friends in a way they'd like me, being funny and listening so this girl would be the one asking we could be back together and then cheated on her. I know how wrong this is and only the girl I cheated on with knows about this and doesn't hate me for it, because every time I do something wrong I do well at taking responsibility and acknowledging how wrong it is, act remorse or tell people not to worry about it.

I could be a business man if my motivation was unstoppable but I have problems getting out of bed, I can have an incredible routine for a week working out, eating well and working, but then next week I'd have so much trouble getting out of bed.

I'm only good at connecting people if they can make me a better person and completely negligent of someone with lower values than my idealized values, I say idealized because I obviously broke many social values until recently, I want to accomplish big things but lately I've been acting and having friends and I never remembered having a true connection, even though I can have any conversation and make it fun, I don't remember missing anyone nor my parents, doesn't matter how long they've been out of the country, and the only reason I would feel bad for any close person dying is if my well-being physically depends on it

Everybody who knows me thinks I'm a great person and want more of it, it's like being a hot girl who can get her ways with her beauty, but for me it's both and I'm starting to hate it because I had this idealized character of myself when I was 13 that I would always be super honest and straight tell people to stop doing stuff that would damage them but these last years I've been only helping people because of what image that gives me. This feeling of knowing what to do to get an output makes life so predictable and it's boring me because even if I become a better person and get a better job or better people I know where that would go, I barely feel like something is unpredictable and it's making me want to shoot myself, and no much deal would be made out of it because investigation agencies in Paraguay are absolute trash.

I sound nothing like what I described here and most of it is written without thought, but it feels good to have this mental mess out on text, I probably need a mental housing because my dad has the worst listening skills a man could have and I prefer dying before breaking character"
96,This contains things that not a single soul knows,"I haven't told a single person about a single problem in my life since July 2017, so it's been over 2 years now. 
You know how most people portray a different self when around people? I do that but usually when people do it, it is to make people think they are good people whereas they really aren't, but for some reason I do the opposite, I make people think I am a bad guy even tho I really am not and I do love every single one of my friends a lot, I'd willingly die for almost all of them but for some reason I'll never let them know that.
I never tell anyone about anything sad in my life to the extent where I lie when they ask direct questions about a situation. Like my grandfather (that I was really close to) passed away recently and in my religion we have to shave our head when someone passed away so people naturally asked me why I shaved my head and I just told them either because my mom wanted me to or I just did it for fun. Another thing, a dog I was taking care of (that my friends knew about) also passed away pretty recently and when my friends asked me where it is now I just told them it had been adopted and is now living a much better life. And the biggest thing, my father was diagnosed with cancer a couple of months ago and whenever someone asks me how my parents are and stuff I just say they're doing well.
I'm scared, I'm sad, I don't know what to do.
I have been depressed for about a year now (I haven't been diagnosed but I know I am because of the following part), I have considered suicide 5 times in 2019 itself,  I have tried cutting myself multiple times but the knives at my home weren't good enough and once come close to cutting my wrist with a proper cutter.
I'm pretty sure that if you ask my friends what they think of my mental and emotional state they'll say that I seem really happy all the time and the word ""sad"" wouldn't even be mentioned whereas I am suicidal.
I don't understand how I keep going out there everyday and successfully put on a happy face that fools everyone. 
I wish I could tell this to someone I knew but seeing that I can't, I'm just going to put this here. 
Thank you for reading"
97,Broken,It really sucks and hurts when you realize no matter what your going to be broken. Everyday for the rest of my life I’m going to be a problem. I shouldn’t be here..I never should have been here I’m never going to be fixed im just going to continue braking until I reach the point braking it’s possible and it already hurts I already thought it couldn’t be worse and it just keeps getting worse everyday I wanna die..so bad...I think about it so much...how mapping everyone could be then how much less stress that would be for everyone around me if I just disappeared....
98,Where do I need to go and what do I need to do for assisted suicide?,Currently living in the United States. Any help or guidance is appreciated. Thank you.
99,Being a bad person makes me want to die 10x more than before.,"I can't deal with it anymore. I'm just good at getting stuck in uneasy situations, being surrounded by 4 thick white walls and that's it. I really really want to cut again and binge-drink until I pass out. With meds."
100,I can't believe I'm still alive,"going to be 35. mid life, i'm a middle aged man. i remember wanting to end my life at 11yrs ago. i remember feeling suicidal in my late teens and early 20s. i have nothing to live for but im still alive"
101,what's the point of living,"I don't get any joy out of socializing cause I""m autistic. so it feels like I'm alone all the time. i haven't had sex in years. i have no skills, my body is old and weak, im broke, i hate staying alive. i always want to just give up and think about dying.


what is the point of life? you live, you work and u grow old. life is so pointless, there's no reason to keep going."
102,Broken,I always going to be broken....I never going to work right and honestly I’m just going to be a problem for someone else to deal with one day and I don’t know if I can take it anymore....nothings ever ever going to change it just keeps getting worse and hurting more as the days go one...
103,Looking for: Courage to end it all,I'm a worthless piece of shit. Any tips on how to get the courage to end it all ?
104,All days are shitty,"So, I came to my university to see if I passed 3 evaluations (maybe that would make me a little bit happy, I like to have good grades), guess who repeats semester. It was evident because I lost a member of my family and fell into a terrible depression, also I understand that the academic system is shit because the teachers do not teach well, I have not slept those days because of how much I have studyed, trying to overcome the loss, so I rather unsubscribe from the University.

I always dreamed of having a job that gave me enough money, a pure love, a house in a quiet place. I lost all the opportunities. I want more eternal rest than to continue living."
105,Help,"I am a 16 year old male with no will to live, and struggles to become friends with people and when i first do i push them away. 

I ran away from my house today because i have been arguing with my parents for several days straight. 

I feel uncomfortable and scared in my own home.

I have had thought on suicide in the past when i was 13 and 15 but it just grows stronger everytime.

I was bullied for 6 years straight in junior and senior school, and people put really high standards for me which i dont acheive and makes me just feel worse.

Help"
106,Finally reached breaking point,"Death sets in when a person ceases to “fight” and gives in to the overwhelming urge to lie down and go to sleep.
I have just reached the end of my tether.  Another day of silence, another day of pointless meaningless nothing. I just can't take this fucking shit.  People have no idea what it is like to have absolutely no-one care about you either you live or die. I tried to go to the shops today but I freaked out as soon as I put on my coat. I don't even open my blinds. 
So I just can't do it. The pressure in my head is like a vice getting tighter and even when I scream at the top of my voice I feel nothing. 
I use redit to express my thoughts and I don't care if people answer or not. I maybe only get a couple of answers. I'm lonely online as well as in real life."
107,I don’t know if I can go on.,"I’m 20 years old I’ve pulled myself up from abusive relationship being bullied, and molested. I’m currently in a relationship with someone who doesn’t want to be with me but asked for a chance and hes giving it to me. Last night I had a talk with my mom who says she stopped loving me five years ago because I was with an abusive boy who controlled me. I only went with him to Escape my moms beatings and abusive words. I tried to kill myself when I was 13 because I was being severely bullied in school . I didn’t die so I guess that gave me hope no one ever knew I even tried it. Today I called my bf who I love but doesn’t want to be with me he said I was annoying Because he couldn’t hear me do I talked louder and he said I was yelling. He hung up. I told him yesterday how I’m ready to kill myself. Him treating me like that I didn’t know what to do so I cut my hand just to feel pain. Then I went and got a cord and tied it around my neck. I placed it in the door and stepped off my chair. I started to choke I just wanted to test it but I felt like I could go through with it because i finally couldn’t feel the pain."
108,I'm losing the energy to fight anymore,"I'm almost at rock bottom. 

I've had chronic illnesses now for over 6 years that need constant monitoring and medication. 5 of those years I've been in severe pain and no one will listen to me. I've been begging doctors for help and I just get told to try paracetamol, to exercise more. 

I wish I could exercise more. I go to work, I come home and have to immediately get into bed because I'm tired. All I do is work and exist and be in pain. 

My therapist got me to talk about a bunch of trauma from my past and now I can't stop crying and having flashbacks. I feel small and scared and helpless. 

I feel like I'm dragging everyone down. My partner is wonderful but I know I'm not enough for him, he'll tell me I am but then we get into a fight because I'm not giving him what he needs. I feel selfish for wanting him to stay with me. 

I feel like I have nowhere to turn, nothing to do except watch my life go further and further downhill. I can't see how it can ever get better."
109,I can't commit suicidw because its unfair to my family and the single friend I have,So I just wish that I would get terminal cancer or hit by a car or be passed out during a house fire. Just anything that would kill me and it would just be some unfortunate event. Then I won't feel so selfish. It won't be my fault I am gone so it won't hurt so much. And honestly right now I feel like a burden to my family. I am 28 and still havent finished my degree bc i was in nursing for 3 years before started dealing w patients and realized it wasnt for me and had to start all over again. And my fiance cheated on me and they wish i would just accept answers i am unhappy with and move forward like they did with their relationship when they cheated and that way I don't have to move in. Bc its obvious they dont want me there and they hate that i have a cat. And I just wish something would kill me already bc I'm an alcoholic waste of space and i feel like no one loves me.
110,Lost the love of my life.,Life feels so empty without her. I just wish everything was over.
111,Can’t take any more,"Today my little sister got extremely pissed off at me because I still enjoy basic cable and I still use CD’s and DVD’s. I’m 29 and I grew up with all 3 of those things. She got mad because I didn’t want to switch everything over to streaming and whatever the younger people are doing now. 

I’m already on the verge of doing it every day. Especially lately. It’s like, don’t push me, please. Over something so trivial. Why do the younger generations get so mad about the fact that I enjoy ‘’old’’ stuff? I’m only 29 but I was made to feel like I’m some 90 year old man who is ‘’too stupid’’ to switch it all."
112,How did I get here?,"I feel like a waste of a human and my only escape is death. 

I went away for college. Everything was great the first two years. I was doing really well academically and then after those first two years everything went down hill. My grades went to shit and I couldn’t seem to pick myself up again. I feel like I can’t measure to other people in my major. 

I lost my drive. I don’t know why I chose my major. My hopes and dreams are gone. Everything seems pointless. I’ve tried praying. I’ve tried finding meaning to my existence. Nothing has worked. 

Now I’ve lost my scholarship. I have I don’t know how much debt and I don’t know what to do with my life. I feel trapped and suffocated by my own mind.

I keep having these thoughts. I picture different scenarios of my death. Hanging. Cutting. Gun shot. Poisoning. Car accident. They’re so constant and they get worse with every second that goes by. I feel so empty. 

I feel like a terrible person. So many people have had it worse. They’ve had experiences that validate their suicidal thoughts. Even in this I feel like a fraud. Like a poser. Fucking pathetic. 

The only thing that holds me here is my family. I don’t want to cause them pain. All they’ve ever done is love and support me. They don’t deserve to suffer because of my inability to cope with my failures. 

I fear the afterlife. I fear where I’ll go if I go through with this. 

I want a do-over. I want to turn back time and fix my mistakes.

I get so angry with myself because this is such a selfish and lazy way to deal with my problems. 

I’m going crazy. My mind is driving me insane."
113,"Just a guy in colorado thinking theres nothing good left for me. I want to be someone else, but I'm considering not being anymore. The tasks of life are too hard",
114,Made it to 2pm,"Every minute awake/alive is agonizingly painful psychologically. I am finding it harder and harder to « live » without very strong urges to kill myself. The things I used to do that helped still help but now I’m unable to motivate myself to do them. But today I made it to 2pm without completely breaking down in full crisis mode. I’m feeling OK enough that I’m going to go out and sit in a coffee shop and have a coffee.

Every day is different but today I made it to 2pm because I was here on Reddit reading about some of your struggles, identifying with them, trying to write a few words of encouragement, and browsing other subs to distract my mind.

So I want to thank everyone who suffered and felt enough pain to reach out here to allow me to interact with them. I had my time of crisis last week and the comments and encouragement and attention was soothing. 

Thank you everybody. I could say this everyday... I am grateful for this community. Thanks for existing. I’ll raise my coffee to cup to everyone who is hanging on by a thread, I am too."
115,"Holidays suck, family as dysfunctional as usual","Came back for the holidays and immediately broke down. My whole family was standing in the kitchen when I got back but they weren’t even talking to me. Ignored me when I tried to join the conversation. I still feel completely worthless in this house and I don’t know how I’m going to handle it on Christmas when my parents just get me a pair of shoes on sale and some cheap clothes but both my brothers get new gaming systems or computers. I would not at all be surprised if one of them got a car. They’re already buying a whole damn house for my brother, but I have to pay rent myself over summer if I don’t want to live here. 

I keep trying but nothing changes. I’m still just the ugly piece of shit that no one wants around. Finally got above a 3.0 in college for once but I cant even be proud about it because my dad keeps reminding me of how “lazy” I was to use depression and suicidality as an “excuse” to get a medical withdrawal from my first two semesters. 

I’ve been depressed since I was 12. I don’t even remember what being normal feels like. I don’t think I ever will. Can’t stop thinking about how I would better serve myself to end the misery now than to go through all the trouble."
116,Suicidal thoughtz,"I don't  know why I'm  here. I'm  home alone. I'm  thinking  of taking a shower, washing my hair. Maybe putting  make up on. Maybe watching  a favourite  show and drinking  some wine.

Then I want to kill myself. I dont have anyone I can call. No one I can speak to. I don't  think anyone can help me. I've  isolated  myself so long I'm  out of options. The family  members  I have, resent it when I'm  in crisis. I dont blame them. They have their own troubles. My husband has gone somewhere  and I doubt  he'll  be back tonight. My friends have moved away and those that stayed, I have  ghosted .  But my dogs are here  and I don't  know who will take care of them. It just hurts too much, you know? I don't  want to be this person. I know people  have it harder than me, and I should be grateful but I don't  think I can do this anymore."
117,How many sleeping assist pills would it take to not wake up,
118,Why can't anyone accept someone's choice and let them die?,"If someone is talking about their life and willing of suicide, why does everyone start to disagree, etc?

Why can't people simply respect others' opinion?"
119,I was so absolutely close to dying,"About a week ago there was a fire in my high school chemistry class, it was even at my table, and since then I’ve been wondering why I couldn’t just have died. By some “miracle” I wasn’t even touched by the fire. I know it would’ve felt horrible to be burned alive but at least I would be rid of this pain I’m feeling now and just be gone from the earth. I had about a week before the fire where I actually felt okay but that was quickly replaced by yet another depressive state where absolutely nothing feels possible. I feel as if the fire could’ve killed me so I didn’t have to kill myself. By killing myself I’m letting everybody (especially my dog) down where as an accident would of course be sad but nobody would blame themselves and I could just be gone."
120,life is tiring,"So like I’m a tranny right? and I am so goddamn ugly that I will never pass so it’s like what’s the point?

My family doesn’t accept me

My friends don’t understand me

And I can’t stand the sight of myself 

It’s just too much you know? When you wake up with body hair again after just fucking shaving it, or when your hair is all greasy again because you’re a disgusting tranny who can’t do anything right, or when you’re beard shadow and nose might as well tell the whole world you were born with an XY

It’s just like whatever. Who the fuck cares. They’ll move on, I won’t, so this really the best option for all of us lol.

honestly I just wish I had died when I was 10 whole life would’ve been just kinda confused but still happy. No one would blame themselves for it."
121,I dont know what to do,"I hope that this is ok to post here but im at the end so if i make a mistake i suppose its not going to effect me.
Ive googled ways to quickly and painlessly end my life. Ive nonstop though about suicide for two months.... i have lost essentially everyone and my cries for help often go unheard.
Ive thought of many things and found myself with a blade to my throat last week.
I cant stop thinking abt that... i want to leave this earth but somehow i find im too much of a pussy to do it each time.

I have no idea what to do now-"
122,"I'm always thinking about death, but not how to die","It's hard. I just want to vanish, but thinking how to kill myself is pretty hard. Had some dreams before that I was hanging and it was scary, agonizing and really made me think about it. I'm also too weak to cut myself. I don't have the might to feel pain and i'm not strong with that. Whenever I see blood or think about things that might happen to me ( decapitate , hemorrhagic or anything that will hurt me)  I feel sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I so weak? I saw some people cutting themselves and I feel envy. I just want to be strong enough to think only about ME and MY WHISES and go for it, but no, i'm a puss7 that thinks about family et all. 

Already tried to take some pills, but I only puke out and had some diarrhea, literally no one gave a single fuck. I'm doomed"
123,ramblings from purgatory,"I don’t know if I will pursue medical treatment anymore for my physical conditions. It’s too frustrating for me to deal with. I’m not sure the 3 months I gave myself will change much of anything, and no point in wasting limited resources just to have them end up in the crematorium. I think I have already killed my self. I have distant and faint memories of the person I should have been, I’ve been killing that honestly joyful person, and I think I finished the job in my late teens or early twenties. So it’s not suicide as I see it, but retribution for the slow death of an innocent kid."
124,"If I had the guts to, I don’t think I’d even hesitate.",
125,i want to give up,"i know my life can be better and i wanted that before and to keep working on things for them to get better. but i don’t care much anymore.. i’m just so exhausted and i just cost my parents a lot of money that’s completely unnecessary cause i don’t even go places or have friends or do anything worth all that money being put into me. i know my parents and brother will be better without me. my dogs will miss me a lot i think which breaks my heart more than anything, but they’ll be taken care of and loved a lot. i can’t take care of them by myself anyways so it doesn’t matter if i’m here or not. i’ve been reading a lot and have learned so much about life recently and i would enjoy seeing what i could get out of this world but i just don’t have the energy.. so i think i’m just gonna go"
126,I don’t know how to make people care.,"I don’t mean to force them to care about me or to go out of their way to ask if I’m okay.. or perhaps I do. 

I guess I mean in a way that isn’t seen as manipulative or as me “begging for attention”. 

I do these things for others, ask if they’re okay and do what I can to make them feel better but the actions are almost never requited, which I understand. We have our own things going on. 

But why can’t someone just care for once.. or at least when I make it obvious I need someone. Why can’t they ask if I’m okay or if I need something.

No one cares if you’re alive. No one cares if you’re dead. They’ll post a photo of you saying you were “loved” and “a good person” before moving on with their lives and forgetting about your death as quickly as they forgot about your existence."
127,I want to die.,"This sentence may look like something a depressed person would say but I'm not depressed or to be exact I'm not depressed anymore. So let me explain why I want to die.
My whole life I had to get through shit, my abusive father, the suicide of my sister, getting physical and psychically bullied and much more.
I've overcome all of this, I'm happy, I have friends and I know people care about me, still I want to die. I'm at a point at which I simply think I've gone through enough shit and life is simply too exhausting. Also it seems extremely pointless, sure I had dreams I wanted to reach but those are long gone. There is just nothing I want do to with my life and there is nothing that would be worth it to stay here. So yeah, I'm happy but I want to die. I will give myself a month from now just do be sure there really is nothing for me, if I don't find something I have to say goodbye. It was nice being here and I hope everyone of you is having something that is worth living for and always remember if you want to Kill yourself because you think there is no one that cares about there will always be someone who cares although It just might be me watching from above, stay alive because I would've cared."
128,It feels like things are coming to an end,"I want to kill myself before 2020. That leaves me with about two weeks now.  
  
I'm not sure of the specifics yet, but I've begun doing some research. New Year's Eve seems like a nice time to do it... I do plenty of reflection and self-pitying on that day usually. Should help get me in the mood.  
  
A lot of things in my life seem like they are all going wrong at the same time. Almost like I was meant to do it now. I have no support for the rest of the year. Meds don't work. Home is stressful and I am more alone than ever... etc.  
  
I don't think I can go on much longer. I can't make myself enjoy anything anymore. Suicide feels... inevitable. It's like I have no choice in the matter. I am destined to kill myself."
129,"End of the year, boys",My work here is done. Can't wait
130,"I feel like I live in a numbed, dead world. I don't want to keep on.numbed","Throughout my whole life, I have always been ''controlled'' in some sort of way. I have always been that awkward, anti-social and wierd nerdy kid.

My family is very religious and have always maked me go to do church-related activities, until I eventually snapped and didn't permit disrespect towards my options. One of the few things that has kept me to ending it all was the belief that suicide would get me to hell, where there would be eternal suffering. Oh boy, what a lovely world.

I have been bullied for 2 years, on the first one I was just a kid, but I have never lived up for the society's beauty pattern or actions that would make me included.

The second year of bullying was the worst year of my life. I remember that every single day I would be a movtive to be laughed at. People would call me the ugliest one in class, some girls pretended to be in love with me, my few ''friends'' turned their backs on me to join them and I would be disrespected every single damn day. Specially by the big ones, since I was very short, scared and weak. I never told anything about it to superious because that was the only type of social recognition that I would get at the time and thus, if I had told anyone about those experiences, I would see myself as a coward, even though I never retaliated or responded...

My family follows a lot of traditions. Ever since I finished school, they have been crawling on my nerves to get a job already( I am 18 and I live on Brazil). My father, specially, is very ignorant, verbally brute, lacks education and morals, mistreats my mom, and shitload of more negative points. My mother has gotten some of these points because of their shared marriage. Every since my sister's birth, I have only looked at more reasons to get anxiuos and stressed on, which do happens often because of my family's impatience who spoils their kids, as it happened to me and recognize it as a bad  action, hence on why I don't ever wanna have kids.

I always wanted to belong somewhere, y'know? Right now I have 2 friends, which is great, but there are a lot of scars from the past that I can't overlook. Those scars hurts until nowadays and I doubt, at times, that I am every going to surpass them. There are a lot of chains clinged to me and I struggle to break them, specially when I have to do it as I deal with an ignorant family. It's very hard to be admitted at an university's exam as It's very concurred from year to year.

I have studied A LOT and made a lot of sacrifices to make it work, but because of my psychological and emotional state, I have done some major errors that may have costed me a place on the university I applied to, which means that I will have to wait a whole other year of stud and sacrifices.

I have been dead on the inside, no identity, no personality. Just weakness and emptiness. I can't find myself and I am losing interest on everything.

My dreams and objective progressively seems more and more impossible for me, which makes me feel more and more uninterested on it's pursuits.

I feel like I am just forcing myself to keep moving through this for nothing more than more problems and unhappiness.

I didn't got a job yet because I don't want to end up like father, since his attitude has been planted on because of traditions and vicious cycles that keep paddling through and through. I wanted to work on what I love but no matter how much I try, this dream seems further and further.

Jesus, I am very weak compared to other generations..."
131,should i be honest to my psychiatrist?,"so i recent attempted suicide so idk if i should be honest or not to my psychiatrist about it because the last time i was honest i almost got hospitilized and my parents were confronted about it, my dad will kill me if he finds out, like actually kill me. what do i do,"
132,"Has anyone ever told you that they won't let you kill yourself because it would be ""their fault"" if you die?","I hate guilt trips like this. It sounds like they're only concerned about you dying not for your sake, but for their own."
133,I think I’m ready.,"I’m just so tired. I’m such a burden to the people around me. I know my parents love me, but I know they wish they did better in raising me. I always disappoint them. It’s so dumb how I have a pretty good life but for some reason I’m so fucking depressed. I feel like killing myself everyday, even on “good days”. I was clean for 5 years and now I’m back to square one. I hate myself so much. I love my boyfriend but I feel like I embarrass him by just being with him. I’ve planned out killing myself many times before, but now seems like a good time. I have the resources I need to know it wont be painful. I’ve only ever told one person how I truly feel and she’s been trying to help, but she lives in a different country and its just been so hard. Ever since my last breakdown about a month ago, my life feels so dull. My ability to feel anything other than sadness is gone. I’ve just been living day to day hoping something good will come out of life, but nothing ever does. I’m going on a trip with my boyfriend this weekend, but after that I plan on going through with it. I know its so selfish but I just want to be happy, and right now I’m not happy at all."
134,Just a question,"I'm not here to give a story or anything but I just want to ask, how is it that you all manage to resist the urge to end it all, no matter how bad things get? I honestly don't think I'll be able to put up with it much longer. Maybe that's just me but, I don't know."

136,Dying as a male virgin at the age of 32. So many regreats.,"Long story short. My father was an alcoholic, he abused both of us \[me and my mother\]. She took a divorce, and then after a while, started to abuse me for many, many years, using different methods. That lead to mental issues, but those aren't main reason, there's more, but it's not the place to write books, and blocks of text. 

I was always a loner, I could never make friends, or anything. Forever alone. I was picked at school, and even outside, until I started to stand up for myself and use force to defend.

A lot of my ex school mates are long time married, have kids, are set for life, with degrees and jobs, and I'm here stuck in time. 

I could easily have sex, but it's not kind of sex I'm looking for, I mean, not with a prostitute, or unattractive female \[unfortunately not a Chad here\]. 

I'm not a piece of meat. I'd like something real, true, a connection with other human being. I could go on, and on. Beside tongue kissing, I have done nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before this year is over, I'll be over as well. Not a big loss to this world.

I'll always wonder how it is to be liked, accepted, loved, how it is to be seen naked, and other stuf... 

&amp;#x200B;

I got mentally raped. That's the outcome."
137,"How I feel - sorry this is long and rambling, I am quite tired and needed to talk","My mom loves me and tries her best but she makes me feel delusional and minimizes what I say to her. I am 16, been depressed on and off for like a couple of years. I have been suicidal for maybe 3 months with abstract thoughts of suicide before that. I have never felt this awful before, I have to Avert my eyes when I walk past the river on the way to school every day so I don’t prematurely throw myself in. I told my mom about feeling depressed and she was concerned and took me to the doctors and no surprise he said I had depression. I had a really bad month after that but then was on a high for like 2 weeks and it was like she miraculously thought I was cured saying things like “oh I think it was just a bit of teenage depression” or “I think you are just lazy” and it made me feel so shit. By this point I had been suicidal for about a month. Then it got way worse and I wanted to stop feeling like it so I decided to tell her that I was having suicidal thoughts. She seemed really supportive and was asking me things like “do you want to act on them (thoughts)” and I was like yeah sometimes. Anyway, she came to me about a week after that because I was having a high period and she said “everyone gets random thoughts, it doesn’t mean you will act on them”. I just feel like I have absolutely no one if I don’t have her. My best friend and my sister always turn the conversation into how sad they are, one upping me and I really don’t want to burden my boyfriend with that. I just can’t do this shit anymore"
138,I don’t want to exist tomorrow,"I’ve invited my friends over for a Christmas dinner as I can’t afford gifts this year. I don’t want to do it. I can’t face seeing anyone. 

I want to be dead before Christmas, I can’t handle existing another year it’s too much."
139,I'm turning 30 next month and my goal is not to be alive for it,"There's nothing left in my world to live for. I'm 29 and I have negative net worth due to $50,000 of student loans I stupidly took out over a decade ago. I have accomplished absolutely nothing worthwhile in my life beyond getting a college degree, which is a dime a dozen these days, so I don't count that as an achievement. I'm not married or dating anyone, I don't have any kids, and I've never even had a proper romantic or sexual relationship. I bought a condo three years ago that I'm now having to sell and move back in with my parents, because my next-door neighbor decided awhile ago that she needs to make a shit ton of noise near our shared, poorly-insulated wall from 6 PM to 11 PM every night, and feels totally justified in doing this because ""it's not my fault how the building is constructed."" My country in general has gone to shit and most people still think that the only thing wrong with it is that people like me, who are too stupid to realize that everything here is already perfect, are allowed to live here. I'm no use to anyone, and I don't even like being here. I didn't even want to live this long; I've been suicidal since I was 11, but never had the balls to go through with it.

Since we're at a relatively high latitude here and it's winter right now, my idea is to go out to a remote location at night and sit outside in soaking-wet clothes. They say once hypothermia sets in it's not that uncomfortable."
140,"I'm having a bad day, so I thought I would try to help others","I start my shift at work in two hours, until then If you want to talk to me about what's bothering you, I'm here.  Or if your just sick of thinking about what hurts you, let's talk about something you like for a little while, and maybe we can pleasant moment even for a second."
141,I'm probably gonna be dead within a week or 2,"I've tried everything, I've tried therapy, I've tried working on myself and my situation, I've tried making new friends, but nothing has helped. Therapy is some fucking bullshit as well because my therapist just threatened to tell my parents if I had suicidal thoughts so I sraight up lied to him. I used to be happy before when I had a best friend, but I swear she just fucking hates me now, every cry for help I've let out has been rejected and I've only been sent further down this hole, so I've decided I'm just gonna do it soon. I'm just waiting for the moment that both my parents are out of the house and I will kill myself. I've had alot of second thoughts about suicide before, and earlier attempts have always failed because I have been too much of a fucking pussy to have gone through with it successfully, but now I don't have any second thoughts at all, it's set in stone and I'm gonna do it the moment I'm home alone. I don't even care how painful any methods will be as long as it fucking works."
142,Words of reassurance,I started to kill myself a day early and o got so scared and I couldn’t stop crying and I called my dad and he’s coming home and I’m so scared and a little high and I don’t know what’s going to happen next but I’m alive now
143,Voluntary organ donation death,Millions of people commit suicide each year and their bodies go to waste. I wish there were countries where you could voluntarily donate every possible part of your body and be put down in an assisted suicide.  Countless people who want to live get a new life and people wh o don't want to live get an honorable end. There could be psychological examinations of the applicants to make sure they don't have second thoughts and are not being coerced. The organs should me mandatorily donated for free to anonymous recipients to make sure people don't do it out of desperation for money. I know this is a pipe dream but would love to see something like this be implemented somewhere in the future.
144,I’m sitting with something tied around my neck,"Well, see y’all on the flip side. I’ve practically lied to everyone that loves and cares about me and this is the last time I may see my own reflection.  

My family never cared enough to help me and that’s okay, because they won’t have to worry or deal with me anymore.  

I was supposed to meet with a counsellor today but I guess that’s not happening either."
145,We are in hell,"70 years of suffering (70 that's being too optimistic) then you die and you're thrown into another flesh prison, rinse and repeat times infinity. Life is not a beautiful ""Adventure"" if you think this YOU are mentally ill. Life is garbage, always was, always will be. And don't come to me with ""bUt It'S wHaT u MaKe It"" fuck off I can't change my body, I can't change the life time label of schizophrenia. Fuck you."
146,I keep messing up but at this point...,"I come from a low-income family, so moving into a developed country was supposed to be the notion that I should study at a decent high school then to a decent university then get a decent job and finally have a family. Unfortunately, the process is not meant for me. Even worse, I am in constant comparison to my other family members who are doing ten times better than I am and are on track 100%

That process happened in university, I failed my programming class, and I could not repeat it in winter nor summer. Since I have to take it next year, I became very aware of the bad habits that range from lack of time management, improper planning, procrastination, and not asking enough questions. I take full accountability of my actions. 

I came up with a solid plan to pass that programming since I have majority of the material (lectures slides, notes, and exam papers) and motivated to relearn everything and take that class again. But when I told my parents about my grade.. 

They asked me what would I do if I failed the class once again, what would be my next step?                                                        What will my other program considerations, since every decent major requires programming, there is really no way around this?                                                                                                                                                                                                       They have said that this is only my first year with couple courses, if I am struggling like hell then what qualifies me to handle more courses in the future.        

The thing is that I can not afford to fail that course. That is not a viable option for me. So, I panicked and could not come with an answer on what would I do if I do fail once again.                                                                                                                                                     

It really feels being truly alone in here. While being asked those questions, I felt the urge to go here, I truly felt like I am nothing but disappointment to my family's eyes. I have thinking about just getting a job, just enough to have my own place to live. I can not live with this mindset of feeling empty, constantly anxious, and pessimist about my future.  

It just gets to the point where all you start is make ultimatums - if I don't make it from point A to point B then that's it, I am ending my life. I began doing research on some of the painless suicidal methods, but I know this pain will carry on to my entire family. As much as they hurt me, they do mean the best for me but it is all unattainable expectations that I can not fulfill and I am very sorry for it. I looked into ways where I could leave extra thousands of dollars for the funeral, and other any burden I have brought into this family."
147,Help,"Nothing feels real. I’ve lost most sense of reality.  I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t. It feels like everything i do is fake, for attention. Fucking help."
148,Wanted to have it done before christmas,Where to begin... basically been depressed for as long as I can remember but the past few months it's become so bad. Everything is too much.. everything is overwhelming.. no one cares about what I want and I feel trapped..I hate how my life is and the only escape is suicide. I really wanted to be out before xmas as I just can not stand the thought of dealing with it and going into a new year.. but I have kids which makes it difficult.. I've written good bye notes to them and have them hidden ready for when I decide to do it. Don't know what I'm looking with this post.. just need to rant and I've absolutely no one to talk to.. plus let's face it no one gives a shit anyways.. when you do tell someone they pretend to care for a bit then act like everything is fine.
149,bout to get baked and “toasted”,"i cant help but spend my days fantasizing about rolling a HUGE joint packed with a mountain of keef, getting stoned outta my mind, and then sticking a knife into an electric socket.

an in-door electric socket has roughly 120v’s? running at about 15-25 amps?? when you jam the knife in and it starts to shock you, the electricity will first cause your muscles to tense up meaning you now cannot let go of the knife. you’re stuck holding on to it while its still in the socket. second, you’ll have breathing and heartbeat problems. third, sometimes you skip the breathing and heartbeat problems and they both just stop altogether and then boom. cardiac arrest. then death. this is the worst case scenario of it all, which is what im aiming for... dont worry. it should be fairly quick. lets just hope its the right kind of socket. 

so yea. im gonna go start on rolling that joint. you know the rest."
150,"I just want to be happy but no matter what I do, I can't","I feel worse than how I used to feel when I was suicidal. I'm so close to killing myself but my fear of what happens next is stopping me, so now I just feel stuck in this pain. This constant pain and knowing that I'll never be happy if I keep living like this. People say you never know, something could change and you could be happy one day. But how can anything change if I'm lying here not doing anything to improve myself? 

I'm in so much pain it feels like my body and mind can't handle it anymore"
151,Why?,"There isn't an answer.
I hate everything that I am and everything I might be."
152,Why do I have to keep waking up in the morning?,"If anyone bothers to read this then I apologize in advance for what is probably going to be a stupid rant by a lazy fuck. I don't have any terrible stories about how I was abused as a kid, I'm not homeless, I have what you'd consider a good job. 

I just don't want to do it anymore. I don't want to drag myself out of bed in the morning, go to work and fix yet another ancient, broken down laptop. I'm tired of begging for the people in charge to swallow the pill and accept the fact that a modern business has to spend significant amounts of money on computers if you want employees to have them. And no that $300 model doesn't cut it. No it doesn't matter if it's more powerful than a high end model from 10 years ago, because the software has advanced since then too. I'm tired of Adobe and their awful licensing models. I'm tired of having to research and learn about things I couldn't care less about, but need to understand to do my job.

If it's not obvious I'm in IT doing mainly desktop support. I don't hate it. I think I'm okay at it. But is this all life is? Get a job that you don't despise, build your life around it and do it for decades until your old and broken enough to retire? Then before long you begin the slow march to death while a nursing home tries their best to drag it out as long as possible? I'm starting to think all those hard drug addicts that ""threw their life away"" because they died before 40 had the right idea all along.

It's just not worth it. All this soul crushing work that goes on endlessly, so I can eat and live indoors? So I can buy a stupid gadget, or movie, or game to distract myself in the precious few hours I do get to myself.  I'd rather end it now and be done with it.

I mean I get it. People have to work or we can't have most of the things that exist in this world. I don't expect to be taken care of, but please let me die. I totally get how a person could have a fulfilling life in a position like mine if they felt any passion for what they do, or had the income and time off to travel without decimating their savings and allotted time off for the whole year for a budget week long trip. If they had a family or at least wasn't a pathetic lazy coward who will never have a girlfriend.

Since I can't reasonably expect to die in my sleep at 24 I think I'll go ahead and get a shotgun.  It's messy unfortunately, but I don't want to screw this up and end up a brain dead vegetable.

Sorry for the rant. I know people here have real problems."
153,Just need to get over fear of dying,It's the only thing in my way
154,Christmas.,Christmas. Alone. It’s my day. I’ve decided that on Christmas I will end my life. I am going to start writing to people who meant something to me and leave it next to me for Christmas and when I don’t show up for duty on the 26th and they find me that will be it.
155,My boyfriend revealed he lost one of his good friends to a suicide in the past,"Man, that hit pretty hard. I don’t know why, but it did. I’ve never lost anyone I’ve loved to suicide luckily, but it’s likely some people I’ve tried to help in the past have lost their battles. Didn’t really affect me all too much since I wasn’t closely connected to them.  

It’s sad to think he was gonna lose me too. Yesterday evening I tried to take my own life. It was a pretty close call but people were home so I couldn’t really go through with it fully.  

Keeping that in mind kinda prevents me from trying again, knowing my death would be causing more damage to someone who has already been through something like that before. He blamed himself for not “being there to help the other person as much as I should have”. The last thing I want is for him to blame himself for not being able to help me in time either."
156,One persons joys can be another’s misery.,"Most people enjoy music right? When you listen to a band perform, you feel excited and intrigued. That’s not how I feel. I am a junior in high school who plays an instrument. I used to really enjoy playing music. Everything changed when I entered high school. I have been unsuccessful every time I try to get into marching band, when I know I can handle it. My band director has said that I’m not good enough on multiple occasions, and it has lower my thoughts of myself. To try and combat this, I have started exercising and eating healthier to make me feel better about myself, but it’s not stopped me from constantly thinking of how shitty I am as a musician. It just makes me sad and upset every time I have to listen to bands as a group. Is there anything I can do to get out of this depressing situation? Thanks for listening. (I don’t plan on committing suicide as I have a lot of anime and video games to play still)."
157,Probably gonna kill myself today,"Since August, I have been in pretty intensive therapy following a few incidents around that time in my life, and for the most part, shit has been progressively getting better until about a month ago.
Work has been complete dog shit. I don’t respect my bosses, they hate me, the hours are long and I don’t even somewhat enjoy the work. My health has gone to complete shit as well. My girlfriend has been noticeably unhappy for the past month as well, and I would love to help her, I would love to do fucking SOMETHING, but it seems as if I can’t even come up with a positive thought to comfort her with. I can’t even comfort myself. 
Then today I go to the doctor, just to find out that one of the health problems I have been having is likely the result of an STI, and the only girl I have had any kind of sexual contact with since the last time I got tested (a year ago) is my current girlfriend. So she clearly lied to me about knowing her hook ups and ex boyfriend were clean. Apparently none of them had probably ever been tested. I don’t want to pay the price of her promiscuity and irresponsibility, yet here I am right? 
I just feel like I’m at the end of my fucking rope. I left out a lot of shit that still fucks with my from longer ago, but that shit honestly should’ve became irrelevant years ago. I just don’t fucking know if life is for me. I have felt pretty god damn ready to give up before, but just haven’t because I couldn’t rationalize it to myself logically.
Well, logically, I should die. I have felt far more pain than I have felt happiness, and ya know what? I haven’t even been around that long, so I BET the worst is yet to come. And I could barely take the shit that has already happened in my life, I feel like even one more bad thing will completely and utterly fucking destroy me. Why should I let that happen? I want to die with my fucking dignity! What’s so wrong with that?
I’ve just never been really happy. I don’t think I am cut out for this shit. I certainly believe that life isn’t for everyone, I seem to be particularly bad at it, and I just flat out don’t fucking like being alive."
158,I just had my heart severely broken and I don't know what to do.,"I've had heartbreak before, not like this. I was completely smitten. Had, what I thought, was a great first date. Come this morning and she says we should call it quits. I have no idea what I did wrong and now I'm shaking and crying, and the noose I have saved looks mighty friendly, as does my stash of pills."
159,Just out of curiosity what would be the least painful way to go out?,
160,Slit my wrists on the steps of the courthouse,"Got into trouble and got locked out of college less than a month in, so I had to move back in with my mom and her shitty bf. Can't leave the area because the court put me under probation but also can't move out because everywhere is fucking expensive, and I can't commit to a lease because I might be sentenced to jail in a few months. I'd like to live in my car, but po says I need an address. Fuck this country fuck the world fuck me."
161,Anyone wanna let me borrow a 12 gauge? Ill only need it once...,
162,Can’t take this anymore,"I can’t take it any more I hate myself I can’t do anything wrong, I can’t talk probably ( I have a lisp), have ADHD, get bullyed at school, have lymphoma in both my legs, parents are fighting with each other constantly, I always push my friends away, I’m awkward to be around and I just can’t take it anymore I’m always nice to people I get treated like shit sorry for the rant my life is going down hill I’m just in a continuous/ constant nightmare and I can’t take it anymore please help"
163,I’m ready,"I have almost everything prepped. I got my noose all tied, the perfect place to hang myself. I’m done with living in pain and feeling unwanted. Goodbye to all and any who read this."
164,I miss the way christmas felt when I was a kid.,"Every year felt so special, it was so magical my memories of it almost feel otherworldly. I miss being able to enjoy spending time with family and playing board games, shopping for gifts and cozying up in front of the fire with my family to watch christmas movies. Now everything feels so bland, so flavourless. Like the colour and emotion and excitement has just been dredged out and left a shell behind.

Like things look the same, the decorations are up, the songs are playing, but it feels like an empty mimickry, there's no joy there anymore. Everything feels that way now, but I guess it hits particularly hard during the holidays. Stay safe out there friends, I know I'm not the only one who feels like this, and I guess to some extent that helps, I'm just tired of feeling nothing when I used to feel everything so completely."
165,Tired of being a victim,"I'm getting it over with tomorrow. I've tried and tried but it's no use. Once something has happened to you, you can't undo it. All you can try and do is cope, and I can't anymore. I've never been able to. The nightmares, the anxiety...I'm just done being a victim. I can't and won't continue like this."
167,Feeling an ultimatum for myself,"I am currently living by myself away from my family and in a trailer. I am using a propane heater for warmth and can only afford that as anything more is too much currently.  I am looking for a job to solve all these issues as I have been trying for 8 years to get into this field and have sent out hundreds of applications in the past 3 years.  everyone has been denied.  I feel that if I don't get a position this year (not sure by what deadline maybe sometime in February) I will end up relieving my pain of being alone and not having a  job. I don't have any friends where I currently am and nothing to look forward to each day besides going to bed for a few hours.  I have multiple plans and will probably combine a couple of them to ensure that the job will be done properly.  I don't want it to come to this point but year after year I have suffered through empty efforts and promises as I see everyone who has worked around me get promotions where I am clearly qualified.  I am looking at writing a letter soon to make sure all my thoughts are down in case this is what is needed to be done. I can't keep living like this, I look back and everything is an empty promise. like I previously stated I don't want it to amount to this but I won't continue to put myself through this pain and suffering anymore and will relieve it the only way I know-how and it will be guaranteed relief for me. 

I have tried for years to find people to talk to and become friends with no luck I am always in the same boat.  We chat it up for a while and eventually, they leave and stop responding without a trace.  I have tried the r/r4r page the r/findfriends and others but nothing works out (the curse of being a guy I suppose). I have been hurt for too long and I am sure with everything I will have written down finally people will open their eyes to it for someone else.  I don't get why this has happened if I am being punished for something idk what it is. However, 3 straight years of suffering, barely affording stuff and not being able to live on my own have pushed me to this point.  The suicide hotline has done nothing for me so I don't trust them as that is the reason I am posting here. I rarely ever get any messages or comments for any post here in general so I don't expect that with this as well.  I mainly wanted to write this for it to be out there for others to see and to get off my chest as maybe someone else will be saved as I feel I am pretty much pushed the breaking point."
168,I don't know what's the point of all of this.,"People keep studying the quarter of their lives to work at jobs they hate with people can't stand, I can't handle wasting my life doing things I hate I feel like I already wasted my life, I couldn't even pass some fucking basic exams while the people who passed them are on the streets or working at exhausting jobs, or getting stuck with their toxic partners and they can't do shit about it, wouldn't it be easier to just end everything m"
169,Completely broken,I don't know how I'll make it through Winter. Everything is going so badly. I've been exhausted for years and things keep getting worse. There is no help coming.
170,Tips on how to prevent people from going off the rails,"I know everyone will say ""there's no way to stop it"" but i want to know how to minimise the amount of pain my family feels, i think they're the only ones who will care, and i have younger siblings, i don't want to fuck them up and it's the only reason i've held on for this long. Do i say ""it's not your fault""? Do i talk about how there is nothing they could have done? Because I don't want anyone going over every conversation in their head and feeling bad. Any help is appreciated"
171,Best ways to end your life,"I cant stand being alive anymore, so I've decided I'm going to die sometime next year. I just know I'll never live past 21.

I've always known that I was going to kill myself one day, it felt inevitable that that was the way I'd go. I just never knew how to do it. I knew 2 people who died via hanging but ...

I'd want it to be quick and painless and preferrably not at home because I don't want my family to sell the house. 

PS please don't try to convince me. I've already made up my mind."
172,They answered," I've tried calling those suicide prevention hotlines so much it became a habit. A habit that every time I just can't seem to get up from the bottom of the pit I call those hotlines. I call knowing no one would answer. I call knowing it's pass operating hours and no one will pick up. I call knowing their could be someone else on the line and no one would answer mine.

 Can you imagine? Someone sitting there alone in the dark with red dripping turning to those people who said they could help but they didn't. They couldn't. Those people put time limit to when we could be sad. Working hours start from 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. Does that mean I can only be sad within that time and come to you for help?

 Can you imagine? The phone ringing and your heart beating. The anticipation that someone, that someone out there will hear you, listen to you. Then you find out that because someone called before now you can't get any help. You have to wait. I understand that man power can be a problem especially with these non profits but at the same time I don't.

 I dialled the number. The phone is ringing and then suddenly something I've never heard before resonated through my ears, ""Hello, *insert organization name*. How can I help you?"". I quickly said ""I'm sorry"" and hanged up. 

 Such a coward I was. Criticizing them and now that they finally answered, all I did was run away. 

 Have you ever talked to these type of services before? If so, what do you say? ""Hello I'm a suicidal freak that feels the whole weight of the world on their shoulder."" (???)"
173,Feeling very alone,"I really want to die. My mom has been ignoring me for the past 2 weeks. I just had a short heated conversation with her and she said that everyone would laugh if I killed myself and she doesn’t want to hear any rubbish I have to say and that I don’t love her (which isn’t true she’s just making herself think that) . My dad just acts oblivious to the fact Im at my worst and is always asking about irrelevant things when he can see Im not doing well like “have you had a shower today” instead of asking if I’m ok. I’m the last choice to all of my friends and they barely text me at all, they all text each other and I always feel left out. even though they do say they are always there for me, I don’t think they really want to have to listen to all of my problems and give me helpful and meaningful advice. I’m mediocre at everything, I get okay grades but there’s nothing I’m great at so my future isn’t looking that bright. I’ve never been in any relationship whatsoever and I’m an only child so I’m scared that if I don’t marry in the future I’ll be alone forever (even though I’m already alone lol) 

but anyways just reaching out for someone who is able to listen and advice me in the best way possible before I end it all. Thanks"
174,"No one will read this, the only thing that keeps me alive is hate/craving for revenge, but I will never get the pleasure of being able to ""repay"" what has been done to me.","I kill my self = they win, I keep living = they get to enjoy my suffering.

This makes me furious. And nothing can be done about this.

Let me hear your hush hush useless words of ""encouragement"".

Please and Thank You."
175,I think I'm just going to end it in January,"I can't deal with another decade of this shit.

For the past 4 years I've been hoping my liver would just fail, or I'd overdose on drink and I'd just die in my sleep. But I'm just tired. 

I'm just going to drink a bottle of Vodka, and throw myself off of a cliff. Maybe then somebody would fucking notice I was hurting and needed help. Maybe then they'd wish they'd just been nice to me, or just said hello. 

I never wanted to hurt anybody. I've tried to be nice my whole life, I was always charitable, always tried to cheer people up, tried to be as kind as possible. I guess Karma is a load of shit. 

I'll probably lose my nerve and not do it, and I'm probably going to be a kissless virgin for another decade. All I can do is hope that a double-decker bus or a ten-ton truck (shameless reference I know) hits me and puts me out of my misery."
176,i dont want to keep going anymore,"i really cant do this anymore. i just want this to end.
i think this is it. im so fucking tired"
177,Anxiety attack,"So i didnt sleep all night in the morning i did go with my father to buy food and get some energy drinks, i try to every time go buy fod with someone because i get panic attack every time i go alone fell like every body is watching me ext so whe entrer all good then whe go to the drinks to buy some whiskey beer ext then my father go pick something in other place and i was looking at the energy drinks alone with a girl behind me then she starts to talk with me saying to dont buy that it will be st discont next week i didnt know what to say but i start to think that she works there and i ask it will be all in discont, and she answers YES it will be all in discount i wanted one of 2 drinks but i fell nervous to pick some but if i also dont pick i would fell also impotent to her so i leave my father reches and whe leave but father ask me who i was talking to and i say with that girl over there he looks at me suprise as fuck then when whe are leaving i see she in her car and i start to think that she dont work there i say what haplend to my dad and he says that she was hiting on me and i like nahh and he says big men and laughting i felt so bad after thinking that im shit talking in pressure and i fell pressure most of the times talking, and if the girl was hiting on me i fucked up realy bad is like not even if they hit on me, something good happends"
178,16 y/o brother in psych facility,"On a throwaway account just in case.

My 16 y/o brother was admitted into a psych facility yesterday after he told his therapist that he was seriously considering suicide and even had a plan. He’s been seeing her for about a year and started after he told a teacher at school that he sometimes thought things would be better if he weren’t around. 

He’s ftm trans and I’m sure he’s dealt with some assholes about it at school, although he doesn’t tell much about what’s going on with his friends or anything. I (25F) live half an hour away from him. 

I’m terrified. I’m so scared that this won’t work and he’ll come out and act fine for a while and then do it anyway. I’m so so scared because I don’t know what to do or how to help or even what to say. I have an anxiety disorder and I’ve felt hopeless before but never like that, and I just don’t want to be patronizing and useless about it. 

If anyone has any advice or even words of support I would really appreciate it. I feel totally lost."
179,Trigger warning,So after six years of not cutting I broke yesterday night. I don’t know again and she literally rolled her eyes. I’m close to the end. I posted to other groups and no one cares everyone head abandoned me
180,I can’t even cry properly anymore,"For so many years now I’ve been struggling with deep, deep sadness. I can’t even call it depression, because I haven’t been diagnosed and after several (expensive) doctor’s visits I’ve discovered that I don´t actually think they believe me.
I can’t take care of my uni work, I can’t hold a proper job, I’m in debt and my relationships, romantic as well as friendships, are slowly drifting away. Ever since I was a child I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and I was bullied relentlessly for years. Two years ago I managed to get raped too, so there’s a bonus.
I don’t know what to do. I’ve stopped telling my family the truth because they’ve gotten sick of hearing about it. They’ve done everything they can, most people have. I have. But I’m really tired now and I’m slowly realising how letting go might be a blessing.
Remember to love and appreciate everything around you, there’s so much affection in the world. But it’s unfortunately not for me.
Thanks"
181,Not feeling to well,I'm not feeling too well been rough lately dealing with family issues and experiencing extreme loniless.
182,it's like everyone is telling me to kill myself,"today at school the teacher said to me ""no one cares if you're here, it would be better without you actually"", i did nothing wrong, was only reading a book and i know she meant only the lesson (well, that still wasn't kind) but i started crying, because generally i feel like no one wants me on this world and suddenly hearing such words telling me it would be better without me, i don't know, it kinda broke me?
also my friend suffers from depression too, yesterday she said ""i want to die and you want to die too, you won't fool me, i know you do, you should kill yourself too"", i know she said so because she was feeling bad, but still, telling me to commit suicide? really? like i'm trying my fucking best all the time to find a will to live and just try to be here a little longer, but it seems it's me against the world, i don't know what i should do anymore, i can't live like that anymore"
183,if i get a clear answer of this.. I'll just end it all,"english is not my first language sorry in advance.

i think about killing myself nearly ever single day.. but im so in fear of what's going to happen next.. im going through a lot .. i dont want to have friends, no hobbies, no interests.. i just feel so desperate.. i dont wanna move in no more.. I'm 22 and i dropped out school with very low skills and  i ended up in a very unpaid job.. terrible communication skills, porn addiction, lack of interests in learning new things.. extra lazy, low energy.....etc  i just want to stop here.. i give up already but the main thing that keeps stoping me from doing it is what's on the other side.. im afraid that I'll end up in a very worse situation and I'd just regret it in the last seconds.. but i really wanna stop it heree.."
184,Help,I'm home alone for at least 2 more hours and I have the strong urge to harm myself really badly. Idk what to do. I can't go to the hospital for a reason I can't get into right now but that's not an option.
185,I want to dissapear on this Jolly night,"It's Xmas

Kids are happy and jolly

People are preparing wonderful dinners and decorations

There's warmth near the fireplace

Everyone is smiling


But I'm not...there's only darkness in my heart, cold, fear....

I feel old

I feel time's up

I feel i did everything wrong

I want to die

Along with me, my mom is unhappy

I'm basically an hikikomori...I hate being one but I can't stop

I'm blocked

I can't decide for my future

I can't do anything....I had lots of potential, I was great at school, bright ideas, nice family....but the future destroyed me


In this Jolly night, while everyone is smiling with their dear one, listening to heartwarming music and watching sweet xmas movie...I want to die


I loved Xmas.. I still do...but I'm unable to enjoy it, and in all my pain, this hurts even more"
187,I need to harm myself to the point where I have to go to the hospital,This is the only way I can think of to get help..
188,How can i help my friend?,"One of my best friend of all my life is very suicidal. I think shes been for a long time, but recently shes making it more obvious, and i think shes asking for help. 
She has cuts on her arms and legs and she gets drunk almost everyday and says horrible things about wanting me and all of her friends to kill ourselves with her. She has also been bullimic for almost a year now. 

What can i do?"
189,Quick question,Is it normal to feel relief and comfort by just thinking about killing myself? It seems that just having the option to end this shitty life provides me with enough comfort to get through the day.
190,I'm scared,"Since 10 years I am thinking about doing it. Almost every single day.

But I am so scared. 

What if its slow and painful?

What about my wife and family?

What will I miss out on in the future?

All I know is that its getting harder and harder to go on."
191,I am impossible to fix,"I'm a pretty realistic guy, I usually see through people's bullshit, so don't give me the bullshit.
I have been apathetic and depressed since 2nd grade, mostly because of school, even tho i didn't realize it back then. In 8th grade I came to terms with it and everyone sees me as the guy that doesn't care about anything or anyone. My family hates me and they all beat me. My grades are shit (Fs and Ds) because I'm fucking stupid and can't remember shit. The teachers always call my parents to school for the smallest shit and all of them hate me, they want to kick me out of the school. My friends make fun of me, but they do invite me to parties and stuff, but I can never go. I live in this village where I'm alone with my family, and the only social interaction I have is at school. I'll be 16 in a month and I haven't kissed a girl yet and see no point in doing so anymore. I've had 2 gfs, the first one left me 3 days after we started dating, and the other one left me after she saw me. From that point on, everything started getting way worse, I started realizing that I'm ugly, especially my body, I have the body of a 12 year old(5'9"") and a big head. In all this I always thought I was pretty and it's what kept me going, everything else in life is correctable, but being ugly isn't. Suicidal thoughts started going through my head, all my family is pretty and tall, why can't I be? These past few days I have been thiniking seriously about killing myself and I'm planning to take 20 xanax and some vodka before bed tonight."
192,Seperating from military,"After 15 years I've decided to seperate from the military, I'm not gonna let this drive me to suicide. I went to a gun store and stared at guns again for the second time and almost purchased a weapon. I texted the suicide hotlinr that day then contaced a reservist recruiter the next day. 

I'm going to be a reservist or gaurd part time to transition into civilian life.  It's time.!"
193,Seperating,
194,How many the users of this sub have actually died?,"i see a lot of users post their suicide notes here i wonder if they really commited suicide

if they are actually dead, there must've been some articles or news about it but i've seen none so far"
195,I’m gonna do it,
196,I just keep coming back to this point,"I don't want to live. I have a 12 year old daughter that I didn't know I had until she was 2, I have full custody and live with my parents. She would have a trashy life if she went to live with her mom. But I will never be good enough to take care of her and I will never be able to have a regular father daughter relationship because of my circumstances.I don't want to work a shitty job just to scrape by. I've used up all my opportunities to go to school and make something of myself. I have one real friend. I recently lost the love of my life because I couldn't pull my shit together. I cry every day. I don't want to live. But I can't do anything because it would hurt everyone around me. I don't know why I care because I wouldnt be here to see their pain. I can't talk to anyone about it because it's always just the same. I need to talk to someone and get help. But I have no will to do that. I just want to be done with this life. I was also molested growing up. I feel like that influence who I became and I might have been a lot better of a person if it hadn't. I just want to die. Someone tell me it's ok to do it. I don't want to live."
197,Please help my pain that I feel,"Hi. So this is my first post. If anyone is reading this I would appreciate your response. I am a 24 yr old British Indian from London and I have been suffering from depression for about 6 years, basically I feel suicidal and everyday I'm finding it hard to carry on I have been to therapists in the past and I am on medication. Ik this is the generic feeling for ppl like me but let me tell you why I feel trapped. I just feel my life heading towards more unhappiness, basically  I am single and as I am Indian there is lot pressure for me to find someone and get married within the next few years, and whilst that would be nice, there is also the fact that time is against me. I have spoken to a few girls but never had a girlfriend. And most ppl that I DM on Instagram are rude and others just simply aren't interested. Im not sure what to do as nobody wants me. I did speak to a girl for a few months and then she just decided she doesn't like me anymore when I didn't even do anything. Idk it's hard to explain my pain. But I just want to love someone but these girls are either horrible or just don't reply. Another part of my life is my career. I work in the family business but I don't like it one bit, my goal and dream is to be an actor/writer and I am trying to work towards this as I go to a good part time acting school. My parents let me do this however they said if I don't get onto the agency or nothing happens within the next year then o have to stop and work at the family business. I have all these ideas for scripts and have such an ambition for film but I'm afraid I might not be able to become something within the next year. So these two aspects of my life are making my depression worse and making me scared. I just want to be with someone who I can love and I am trying my hardest to become and actor. I pray to God every single day to help me with these things and to bring me happiness but I feel everyday is the same. I'm trying the best I can to make things happen for me. That's why I'm here. Maybe someone can help me?? Sorry for the long message. Not sure if I have explained myself fully. If anyone has got this far then thanks for your time. Please help if you can. Thank you and merry Christmas."
198,"I'm a horrible person, I don't deserve to be loved and I don't deserve to be alive.","

All my life I've been dealing with extreme social anxiety and have been really depressed for atleast 2 years now 
(btw I'm 16M and in school) and just recently, I finally get a girlfriend. Every thing is going great! We date for over a month, she tells me that I'm the best guy she has dated. Everything is going great.
I'm happy, I'm actually happy for the first time in a while, and this time it wasnt that ""happy"" that only last for a couple of hours. We go on dates, I meet her parents, she meets mine, everything is going great.

Then all of a sudden I get a huge wave of depression, I get suicidal thoughts again, and my girlfriend is still supporting me through everything and i just love her so much.


Now, recently, my stepdad's niece (20F) moved into our house. No problems, until one night while we are watching a movie, she starts grabbing my penis, and fast forward to now, we have been ""pleasuring each other"" alot and she had given me head 4 times.

I think the reason I did this is because I've gone numb and I just haven't been caring about anything lately and have only been focusing on not killing myself, so when she did that, I just went with it.

At the moment I felt fine but now I fucking feel like shit because I just cheated on my girlfriend multiple times now with a fucking nymphomaniac and I just fucking hate myself, I'm such a selfish asshole for cheating on my girlfriend. I chose lust over love. I can't believe how I can't even talk at school because of my social anxiety, yet I can cheat on my girlfriend just fine???? What the hell is wrong with me.

I don't deserve to live, I don't deserve my girlfriend she is so perfect and amazing yet I cheated on her with a nymphomaniac and why the fuck did I do this, I should be fucking grateful that I have a girlfriend in the first place since I thought that was impossible for me .

 I just want to kill myself I just can't anymore I really want to die"
199,I want to leave this place," 

Hey everyone.

I'm writing this to strangers on the Internet, because I feel like nobody in my life understands me, except me, but a huge part of me doesn't seem to care about me enough to implement some things and move on from many traumas finally, or at least make an effort not to slowly continue myself.

I went through some horrible shit in my early childhood and I didn't realise understand what happened.

I started self-harming since 11 years old and since then I do it and I'm 25 now. Not everyday, there were huge chunks of time I didn't self harm, at least no physically.

I've tried to kill myself when I was 15 first, then when I 22, then again this year.

I've been in 6 relationships which I consider a lot considering my age, and it caused me a lot of pain, trauma and heartbreak.

I kept falling foolishly for people who presented themselves as everything I wanted, but most importantly needed and so I realised year or two later, after so much arguing and blaming myself, they were actually pretty abusive and they made a sane person (probably more people than just me) to behave in innapropriate ways, I literally let them walk all over me because that's how I had to act as a child.

I've been through numerous psychologists and psychiatrists, been diagnosed with a lots of labels, but generally speaking I don't believe in labels, I believe in symptoms.

This is how I feel both emotionally/physically/mentally and spiritually on a daily basis for quite a long time now (I'll get to that later)

Chronic pain in my body wakes me up before I got enough sleep, if I even manage to get more than 6 hours I still don't feel rested because I have weird scary nightmares or just very uncomfortable dreams that I forget as soon as I wake up.

I have in the past tried to cut off my left arm and that hurts both physically and emotionally to this day.

That's why I'm addicted to painkillers as well.

I get agitated almost every morning because of that. I am angry first thing in the morning, before I drink benzos and have 2,3 cups of coffee and smoke and listen to music or watch Youtube. I am unemployed for 3 months now and I feel like a failure. Even being a waiter caused me to break down, amongst other factors.

I lost hope in people and the world around me, there is some left for myself, but when I really think about it, if I expose myself to the world they will kill that hope, and its small anyway.

I don't know who I am, I feel like I'm living in constant cognitive dissonance, I constantly question myself and everyone and everything around me until I get so restless, panic and lose interest in pursuing anything or anyone and just want to disappear.

I am very paranoid about people and the world in general. It drives me crazy to think about the possibility of someone tracking my phone or ip address, or what I do and where i go and how often. I don't like feeling manipulated or controlled but I am, because I am a part of this system whether I like it or not.

I have aspirations for myself, but I don't have motivation to pursue them.

I often criticize and verbally abuse myself and others, people tell I am very negative (mostly my family) and it pisses me off because its like they don't understand how much fucking trauma I went through, how can I stay positive, I really don't know, all those positive and motivational quotes and stuff seems so unrelatable and untrue to me.

I have a reason for acting this way and being this angry but it gets me more angry that people who should understand that, don't and instead make my state worse by telling me these hurtful, untrue things that only deepen my self-hate and hate towards them and the psychiatrict system and the world in general.

I am unable to connect to people. I am very nervous in social situations, I have paranoid, obsessive thoughts that make me very anxious, my hands are always shaking, I hate how when some people notice that they ignore me and don't want to have anything to do with me.

Each and every guy I've been in a relationship with, I 'm sure he only wanted me first because of my looks and second because he didn't really listen to me so he didn't understand that I'm not the type of person he is attracted to, they were attracted to their own ideas of me and when I was honest and upfront, they really didn't listen and then later blamed me for having issues and actually made them worse.

My friends do not call me or message me anymore, they have given up on me. They are tired of hearing depressing &amp; suicidal thoughts and they don't take me seriously because I talk about it a lot, but only rarely try to go through with it.

I feel misunderstood, rejected, unworthy of true love for my soul, not my looks, unheard and desperate. I am apathetic, I don't care about my body so now I got myself in a bad state, I'm anorexic, all my ribs showing, all my bones sticking out, I have no energy, mental, emotional or physical.

My hair is falling out, I'm addicted to Benzos and I abuse drugs because those are the only moments where I feel happy, relaxed, talkative, excited or any other positive emotion.

When someone tries to get close to me or I feel intimacy I want to cry but I don't want to show them my tears so I get angry instead or just dissociate completely.

I have many flashbacks and certain words, energy, smells and people, situations that make me very angry, mistrustful and I just want to leave asap, but then I come home to be critized for not doing enough to help myself, for looking like a skeleton, for dressing up a certain way, I've lost all will to try to engage in any kind of relationship.

When I look at myself in the mirror I feel so sad for that little girl that has lost her innocence and childhood to selfish people.

I cry and weep everyday for her, I loved her spirit so much. I feel broken. I think I'm slowly killing myself, so when I do overdose or something people won't say I did it to myself because it wasn't as noticeable as a quick suicide.

I don't know what else to write, I'm so tired and I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.

I think only then will people around me partially understand their fault and how much I was in pain. But I don't think they will feel guilt, they deny having to do anything with it.

Anyway, I'm gonna go now, thanks for reading."
200,I can’t take the hits.,"The hits, one after another, week after week, over, over, over and over again. I can’t take the hits. I can’t close my eyes. My eyes can’t stay closed. I don’t like what I see when I close my eyes. I can’t sleep. I won’t say what I see, but I can’t close my eyes anymore. I have no choice but to keep taking the hits. It’s my only way to survive. My brain rattles. I have to keep taking the hits.  It’s my only trade. I don’t have an option."
201,AM I THE ONLY ONE WHOSE NOT EXCITED FOR UPCOMING DECADE??,"I really feels so sad. I tried to do some hobbies and play games. 

I feel so tired hanging out with people. Reasons why I don’t want to celebrate Christmas and New Year anymore. For me, it feels like bullsh*t faking your HAPPINESS."
202,Xmas and new year's eve are coming closer,"Oh my, i find that so much stressful. It makes me wanna commit suicide so bad."
203,i got woke up by my mother with screaming and getting hit because she didn't find her cigarettes,I have a whole blistee of clonazepan and a bottle of vodka. u guys think is enough...? I don't want to suffer anymore
204,All it takes is one bad day to break my illusion of a hope of getting better,It always comes back. It hurts so much more each time because it gets harder and harder to keep doing the exact same fucking thing over and over again
205,"i stood up to my mom, feel even worse now","Yeah so I stood up to my mother tonight. I told her how everyone including me thought her excuses to giving me my identification was her trying to keep me dependant on her like my brother (25 still living with her, only ever had one job he pretended to be sick all the time until he got fired, threw a tantrum and gave up applying to walmart bc it was too 'hard')  I told her how she was killing me by refusing to let me talk about how truely awful I feel inside, how her broken promises to take me to see professionals makes me feel. 

I told her I can't deal with the gaslighting and guilt tripping when I try to ask why she won't help me. I told her we aren't close anymore because she's either always at work or on the phone. That the first and only thing she says to me when she gets home every day is berate me for not cleaning good enough. That she reminds me of my abusive step mother when she does that. 

I told her what she's doing is making my mind rot more and I'm also at this point I have no one left, I thought I'd at least always have my mother. 

Then she just resigns. Texts me she will take care of everything and gets up to look for my school papers from before she pulled me out of school years ago. Doesnt say a word and goes on to search. Im supposed to feel like i accomplished something so why do I feel even worse than before. 

I feel like i lost more than i gained here. I dont even have anyone to talk about it with now."
206,Tomorrow is when my last seven days in this shit world begins.,
207,i want to die,"i dont want to die because im depressed or hate my life, im curious about what happens after death, im so confused at the way the universe works and believe that im the only 'living' thing in our universe, and i want to find out what happens after death. im 99.99% sure this is how the world works, that im just a malfunction for having thoughts like these although after doing some research, turns out i have been thinking about the sopholism theory but in a bit of a twisted way, i really want to die, but im scared that my family will realise or find me dead if my theory is incorrect, or i wont be able to do it properly and still survive, if i could have instant death right now i would definately take that oppurtinity but im scared of pursuing it. i just want to know, in my 'after life' ill be happier or will i not malfunction in my after life or.. idk

&amp;#x200B;

this is probably difficult to understand but i just wanted to see if anyone else had thoughts like these...."
208,Does anyone else fantasize more about how you'd want to be treated when you die rather than fantasize about how you die,"One of the things that stops me from killing myself is how grotesque and ugly and messy the aftermath of death always is. I've seen some gore videos of people shooting themselves in the head and their skull is half blown off and leaking everywhere and I just can't end up like that. 

Like for me I sometimes fantasize about dying by electrocution in the bath. But if I did that I know that my roommate would find me and freak out and there would be ugly tears and he's epileptic he'd probably have a seizure on the bathroom floor and get hurt. I'd end up in a morgue getting pumped full of chemicals and put in a coffin dressed in black and I'd have a funeral in some church I don't give a shit about. My death is worth more than that.

What I want to happen is have a stranger walk in the bathroom to find my body. And he would calmly and wordlessly lift me out of the bath, towel me off, and place me on a bed. He would dress me in a red suit with a white shirt, not too formal, no tie or anything. And then I would want him to carry me to some secluded meadow. Lay me down in a bed of wildflowers and just leave. And my body wouldn't rot or be eaten, it would just lay there, dignified, innocent and alone until the end of time.

If I could have that, I would take death without a second thought."
209,What is the difference between dying now or in 50 years?,"I can't see it. Everyone's life ends the same way, what's the point? It's a cruel joke, a madhouse"
210,Suicide looks pretty inviting right now,
211,Really at the edge,"I've worked at the same place 10 years. Suddenly a promotion opened up. I would have quit smoking weed had I known. I only had 10 days to get clean so I used fake urine.

They told me they had to send out the results. My friends test (the same place and job) was done in 10 minutes. I'm convinced they caught me. They sent it out and it will get detected.

I trained my replacement all week. He starts tonight. I have no job to return to. I'm just waiting for a phone call telling me I failed or passed and I'm convinced I failed.

I wasted half my life at this dumbass job. I can't start again from 0. It's the only job I've ever known. I have no education. I don't want to be a slave in a factory and work every weekend and holiday until I die like a dog. I should have never tried to change things.

If I get that call my life is done. I can't sleep or eat. I can barely move. I can't believe I did this to myself."
212,Kms,"Think I’m abusing meds too much now.  Been taking codeine x temazepam as it’s a great numb.. only problem is this was my last batch and I don’t think I’ll be able to get more... I should have saved it for a proper dosage so I could painlessly stick a knife into my upper arm artery, that’s how I think I’ll go. 

I always picture overdose or bleeding myself will be how I do it. My family member hung himself but I don’t think I could do it that way."
213,Ramble,"I don't really know how to start or say any of this but I just feel like I need to vent. Every day I think about suicide, almost constantly. It's really unhappy, but it's not even like I have a bad life. Its just I'm a really shitty person and lots of small things that bother me. I have no real hobbies or passions. I pretty much never have any fun, nothing holds my interest. I quit my job like a month ago for no real reason other than I didn't want to bother anymore. I'm 19, I never finished high school for pretty much no reason aswell. I just stopped going. I'm mean, and ugly and boring as fuck. I have no skills or talents, and I'm lazy and get really upset and frustrated really easy so I've just given up on trying to develop any skills. That's another thing, I just give up on everything so easily. I've never had a girlfriend, or had anyone show any kind of interest in me ever, never kissed. I was never super bothered by that but recently it's started getting to me. I know I'm still young and everyone says it's not a big deal and it'll happen when it happens but the thing is I know me. I know that it won't. When am I ever going to meet someone like that and why would they be interested in me. The real reason I want to die is because I know in my heart it's never going to change. I know myself, I will never take or commit to any actual steps to improve, and before I know it i'll be 30, still living with my parents, working some shitty minimum wage job I hate, coming home and doing nothing all night on my computer till I fall asleep. Still alone. I have really bad anxiety I literally just sit around with no responsibilities and I'm stressed to the point I feel like I'm going to cry or throw up. Doing the most mundane things makes me really nervous. I have a stupid crush on a girl who I met on-line and we play games together almost daily, we met irl once and are meeting up again soon but I know she doesn't like me back. She talks all the time about guys she hooks up with and how she doesn't even really like guys or whatever and it's like that's fine but I really just wish I didn't feel this way about her, because it would never work anyways. This last bit is not even really that big a deal, but it just feels like we have so much in common and if she doesn't like me then who the fuck ever will, she's literally the only girl I've ever even made friends with. Most of this last stuff is pretty fleeting and unimportant but it's just another thing that weighs on me. Sorry for the incoherent ramble, and sorry if this is insulting to any of the people on here who are struggling through real hardships. I believe in you."
214,I'm tired of feeling inadequate but I don't know what else to do.,"I just feel like garbage all the time. And medication isn't helping. It's helping the chemical aspect of it, sure.. But I guess this just isn't a part of it. Because it's another separate altogether reason why I'm depressed. Because I'm worthless. I'm incompetent. I'm ugly. And I'm stupid. For years, I just haven't been able to help telling myself these things, and I think the reason it all started was because of my childhood and adolescence. I've been bullied and abused relentlessly. I've had teachers tell my parents that I'm retarded because all I wanted to do in class was sit by myself. And it's not the first instance of it, either. A lot of people have called me retarded, precisely because I just don't talk. It's not that I can't, it's just that I've always been a quiet person.

I'm 26 now, and I just beat myself up everyday I'm alive. Co-workers tell me I'm too hard on myself. My parents tell me I'm too hard on myself. Doctors, neighbors, friends, you fucking name it. But..I don't think I am. Because I genuinely feel worthless. My life is worth nothing. But people insist that it is. People act like its a fucking wonder I feel this way. But why should I feel any different? All throughout my adolescence, I've been completely alone. No one's ever liked me or found me attractive, apart from a load of women online from various long distance relationships. But all the while, I'm watching people around me date and fuck like wild animals, all the while singling me out for not doing the same, making me feel like the fucked up unattainable *nobody.* I don't really feel as low anymore about the whole drug aspect of it. That I was singled out because I wasn't a ferocious heroin or meth addict. That's just fucking stupid. But the whole dating thing? That's touching a nerve..

And I just feel as if nobody likes me. Even online, since online's been my only source for socializing. I feel discouraged to even post anything, especially if I don't even get likes on social media. And I know that's a stupid way to seek validation, but what else do I have? Loving yourself is complete bullshit when the people around you seem to always give you reasons not to.

I don't think I can come back from this. I don't think I can change. I feel like those years just fucked me up. And it wasn't just school. It was my home life. It was abuse. And all of it culminated into not just a depression which I'm still fighting, but anxiety. Anxiety that's made me afraid of the environment that I grew into."
215,"In the future, I want to do a Job where I could help, or at least, """"try to inspire"""" (that's too cocky, sorry) people like you","It crushes my heart that soo many good, kind people are so unhappy with their lives, depressed and hopeless to the point of thinking about on giving up on it...and society overlook those people constantly..

Life is not a gift, however, life shouldn't be a curse either...no one deserves what you're going trough

I know that this is not exactly the right sub where to ask this question, but to whoever feels like answering...what job (besides volunteering) do you think could help work out theese issues? What career could give a bit of hope?"
216,My Life isnt... Horrible.,"Idk. My life isnt bad. I have a loving boyfriend and a sweet 2 year old pup. But for some reason, I never feel good enough, I always feel like they would be better off without me. 

I grew up with quite a bit of abuse, my adoptive parents died when I was pretty young and the family that took me in really didn't understand how i felt. I was diagnosed with BPD rather early in my teen years and Its just now started really eating at me.

I still cut... I have night terrors, flashbacks (Rape Trauma), sometimes I just want the pain to go away. Every day i just think about how if i disappeared everyone would be better. 

I just cant seem to find a good reason to keep going anymore..."
217,Suicide,I want to kill myself any pills?
218,I'm happy. But why do I get random urges to hang myself?,
219,I don’t know what to do,"Copying this from another post I made on another sub. I really need help.

I’m 23. I got out of a 5 year relationship with my best friend about 6 months ago.  Since then I’ve been dealing with non stop suicidal thoughts, mental hospitals and one actual attempt to take my life since.   After straight hell for 6 months I’ve recently been diagnosed with BPD but I’m not being medicated for it.  I’m on antidepressants but idk if they even work, I just know that I feel miserable with and without them. My psych recommended a book called “I hate you, don’t leave me” but I’m not sure if it’ll help with my BPD, that is if I even have said personality disorder. :/

I haven’t been able to live one day of my life since he left without thinking about him or dreaming about him. I can’t enjoy anything we used to love and share together without thinking about him, breaking down crying over an episode of my favorite show. I can’t get out of bed most days and sleep for 15 hours or more. When I’m not sleeping I’m staying awake for days just to not dream. The dreams are even more painful, he’s always there like nothing happened and when I wake I’m alone. 

I binge drink occasionally, bad habits and shit. If all of this doesn’t stop I’ll have to end my life for good, I can’t take this anymore. After attempting once I realized how easy it really was to take that final leap. Idk what to do anymore and idk how to handle this. All I know is how I’m going to end it"
220,First post,"Just spent an hour line fro the hotline. great deterent i guess. i got angrier at the wait and non working chat and forgot abot slitting my wrists, touche"
221,The only reason I haven’t committed suicide is because I’m afraid I will fail...,
222,Thoughts.,"I'm a person who has had many people talk to them about suicide and self-harm. All my friends, probably know me as the suicidal person. I've tried to commit suicide twice now, both times stopped because I'm afraid of going further. The second time was more brutal than the first. Because I couldn't go all the way with it, people think I'm just attention seeking. My own mother just encouraged me to commit suicide, over the phone and before I said anything, she ended the call and I broke down. I've always been a broken mess. The only reason why she encouraged me to commit suicide was because of my suicide attempts, she would always threaten me but after my failed attempts, she has now in turn used my own suicide attempts as a way of encouraging me, in the past before my attempts she would just beat me senseless, to the point I now feel pleasure in pain. I feel broken inside, I now like seeing people in pain. I often browsed the gorey/dark side of the internet. Call me a sadist as you like. Well for you to understand what feelings right now, I got to bring you to the past. Ever since I was young, a wee lad. My parents would beat me, for anything minor. I spilled water on the ground, and I cleaned it up while my mum was on the phone witnessing it. I smiled to her, after she finished her call she slapped me, got out of the room and brought back a broom to beat me with. Another story, my dad was having his birthday and we made an absolute mess, it was fair that my mother didn't like that. So she got me to clean up but had set a timer for 2 minutes to clean the whole mess up. It would of definitely taken longer than 2 minutes to clean up everything. But every time the timer went off, she went and beat me and reset the timer, you would know the rest. Nothing got better after my dad left the family, my mother was upset and she took it out on me, saying things like ""I should of never had you"", ""it would of been better if you were never born"". It hurt a lot, I never showed it to her face, but every time I lay in bed, I pretend I have someone to hug me and make me feel better while crying. It does temporarily make me feel better but I've already accepted the fact, such a person doesn't exist, I've tried all those ""suicide prevention"" ""get help here"" websites and it makes me feel a lot more miserable. ""You should talk with your friends"", no. I've seen how my friends treat people who have depression or anxiety, make a mockery out of them, I've put on a facade of being pretty easy going and a normally happy person. ""\[Person\] has anxiety? That's fucking bullshit"", after hearing about one of my former classmates with anxiety, I felt that I could relate, my friends just laughed and mocked said person. I'm not certain if I have anxiety, I don't want to self-diagnose myself but I feel nervous to talk to people and have a difficult time starting conversations or talking to anyone to anyone new, I was just awkwardly wave or nod. There is absolutely nothing anyone or anything can do to make me feel happy, I've lost that emotion long ago. With some hobbies to make me feel relaxed but never complete. I use the internet as an escape, always in my head about the day I can live out the rest of my days in the virtual world, with everything going my way. I know I'm a degenerate, but sometimes I watch anime or read manga mainly 'isekai' and go. ""I want to live there"". But I know for a million years, or how many years after that will never be fulfilled. The only other salvation I can think of it death, because death is just endless sleep. I will never face pain, emotions and a uncaring world again. ""You can't feel joy or some other bullshit, if you're dead"", too bad, I've never experienced real joy, the joy you may think I'm experiencing is just a facade. 

I know, I'm very fully aware of how some people have it worse than me and I live in a blessed environment. Honestly, I rather die a slow painful death, rather than living a slow miserable life. I've already accepted my fate, that I will die alone. For my age, I'm thinking to far ahead but I always wanted a future where I could have my own family. ""It's not too late, to start looking."" Honestly it isn't too late, but no one will accept who I am, I have nothing positive going for me, only negatives. I'm ugly, I'm lazy, I'm a degenerate, I have no bright future. I'm the total absolute opposite of what any person would look for, for someone they want to live the rest of their days with. I may be trying to make my parents, friends and society as villains but in the end, I'm to blame. I've made my parents look guilty, but in reality I'm the guilty one, I've never tried hard in my studies, too lazy to work and other reasons I'm too ashamed to list. You the Redditor reading this will probably write something to try help me, but honestly reading articles and what other people have said I've stopped caring. So I apologise in advance, and honestly if something negative was written, I wouldn't mind. I know I've been babbling on and on about nonsense and my life story. But writing is one of my few hobbies, I never got into it in English classes and got average to low scores in tests. I'm highly delusional, always imagining myself into fantasies. Well back to guilt tripping my family, when ever I did something that my parents did punishable, my closet relatives who I would go to for help or protection ALWAYS and I don't mean enough when I say ALWAYS take the side of my parents. Surrendering me to my parents so they can beat me, I've been cut with a knife by my mother. THREATENED with a knife at my relatives place, no one batted a eye for me. Probably just wanting me to be cut down, at this point, right now in the present while I'm typing this, I wish only now that I was actually cut down. I've been thinking about writing a story, and publishing it to some random site for criticism. But I've never taken criticism well, even if it's to help me, I've been verbally abused too many times to tell the difference. Why I didn't do well at school, well I have an excuse, not a proper reason but merely a excuse. I've been yelled at while asking questions, when my parents would try help me and beat me without understanding the question because it's easy for them as adults but not easy for me as a kid. When they did tutor me from age 4 onwards up until highschool, I was beaten for asking questions, so I became the shy kid who never asked questions even if I was stuck on anything. I felt like I was a bother if I asked any questions if I was stuck, that there we a major backlash if I asked questions for being stuck. I mean, I was beaten for asking questions. Only until my final year of highschool did I ask a few questions, but it was too late, I had dropped out of all my ""uni/college enabling"" courses (I know the proper name of the course). So I didn't do well, I tried enrolling into a uni/college enabling course and failed. So for the past two years, I've been living a lie. I lied that I had entered a college/uni for the past two years, I feel so guilty. I know what would happen if my mother were to find out, I would move out but I have no money, I'm too lazy that I barely work, the work is too hard that I work only a few hours. It's almost the start of the the third year, I'm meant to ""graduate"" soon. But there is nothing to graduate from and that is making feel miserable. I just wanted a life where I can enjoy myself, live life to the fullest, no need to work hard. But that's not how the world works and I know it. I'm old enough where I should be able to make my own decisions but I feel like a toddler still not ready for the reality of this world.

I don't know whether I've strayed off-topic, a paragraph about my life and why it fell into a shithole. I can't really blame anyone but myself. Maybe all those questions, I should of known them myself. Maybe, I couldn't solve them because I'm just a moron. To the point where I've become a shut-in only pretending to go to college/uni and making up a fake timetable. Soon enough, all my family and friends will realise my lie, lashing out at me for being a useless member of society. I just want to die, I want this nightmare to end, I really don't want to be here anymore. I'm not strong enough mentally to live here anymore. I've only written on this sub, to try make myself feel better but it's not working. It makes me realise of what a scumbag I really am, not doing anything for society and trying to victimise myself. 

I apologise, for the extremely long read. I know most of you won't read it, and skip to the bottom for a TLDR, but there is none and you leave the post for a shorter read. If I did put a TLDR, it would just make myself feel a lot more meaningless, which is a fact I'm stating."
224,I fucking hate my life.,"Just spent hours crying (still doing it). I know the least painful way to go but I don’t have the resources I need, so I’m being forced to do it the hard way. It fucking sucks. This is always going to be my life. I am never going to be freed from this shit, medications, therapy, nothing will ever fucking work. I’ve been thinking to suffer for 3 minutes just so that I never have to think of anything again. I’m sure wherever I end up in the fucking afterlife, I will be annoyed with myself for not doing it sooner."
225,Money,"I’ve always held the opinion (well it’s true and there’s no refuting it but I’ll call it opinion for arguments sake) that the more money someone has, the happier they’ll be. I’ve been dirt poor my entire life which is the biggest reason among other things of course  I’ve been suicidal. I know for a FACT if I had enough money to live comfortably I’d be happy.  But no, I’m working a fucking shitty dead end job that’s under the poverty line, living with parents because I can’t fucking afford to move out anywhere near me. Don’t earn enough to even get my fucking drivers license 


Which is why next pay check I’m spending literally all of it on lottery tickets. If I don’t win, that’s my queue to fucking end it all. 

So I’ll update this post once the results have come out for the lottery I enter.  

I’ll leave you with this, If you’re too poor to raise a child, fucking abort it . Don’t bring a child into a world if you’re going to give it a shitty life with no opportunities to break out of poverty. Because the child will never accomplish anything , and will end up like you. Fuck you and fuck the world"
226,"I just want to be loved for who I am, but I understand that I don't deserve that.","I feel like my family only loves me because they view me as a trophy that signifies their own accomplishments. I'm a result of their ""hard work"" when in reality, the way they raised me damaged me. Years of denying me therapy, telling me to kill myself, calling me worthless and undeserving, etc does wonders when a child is developing/going through adolescence.

Lately, I've isolated myself from my friends because they don't want to deal with me. I came home crying the other day and one of my roommates ignored me and locked herself in her room because she didn't want to deal with me. They've spent enough time without me that they realized that they don't need me -- they don't want me, unless I'm there to provide something for them. I confided in a few that I attempted suicide, but that wasn't enough to get them to care. 

But it's okay. I'm just a burden after all. I just want to feel loved and understood, but I know I don't deserve it.

I wonder a lot about how different things would be if I had just received the help I needed when I asked. How much healthier and therefore more likable I would be? How much more fulfilled I'd be currently? But no, I'm just a burden, whose health and well-being is not even second priority to my family's own convenience. To be honest, I have a lot going for me. I earned my education and my scholarships. But what does it all matter if I don't enjoy life? If even going through the motions is so unbearably numb?"
227,I hate myself,"I want to kill myself so bad, but my dumbass just can’t do it. I don’t even believe I have depression. Everything makes me hate myself more. Literally every action I take makes me loathe myself. I want to die for fucks sake. I’m just going to wait for the hope to disappear and then I’ll finally force myself to get it over with. No matter what fear or guilt or regret I feel, I’ll ignore it, for the greater good. Even just saying that makes me want to shatter my spine."
228,Wish these existed,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbmQxZkSswI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbmQxZkSswI)

231,Advice for someone who is trying to wait 20-30 years before ending it.,Does anyone have advice or experience with numbing yourself for a prolonged period of time? I want to end it but refuse to do it before my family moves on or forgets me and so am now in a position of trying to minimize my own suffering while I am waiting. I am having some success with weed and alcohol but was wondering if there is other good tips or tricks.
232,Tired,"I'm just tired of everything. I don't want to leave the house, I don't want to be with friends, I just want to die or at the very least not exist. I feel so fucking unwanted and I hate it, I'm so fucking lonely yet don't have the energy to meet new people or reach out to my friends. I make everyone a priority when I don't mean anything to them and I can't fix it. I binge eat when I'm sad and it keeps getting worse, school ended and I passed all my classes but I was happy for what, a day? It does not fucking matter, the past few therapy sessions I told her I was passively suicidal , that if a car was going to hit me I wouldn't move out of the way but now I just want to run into traffic and just fucking die. I wish I had the actual courage to fucking off myself already, I don't think I could even if I had a gun in my mouth and a finger on the trigger. Just let me die, please, this world sucks and it won't get better and I know for sure that I won't get better either."
233,I have a bottle here,"And it has plenty of pills for me to be able to take my life. I've been depressed for the last 10 years, and suicidal for about 7 of them. I've never felt this low before. This suicidal. This ready to say goodbye to the world. I can't do this anymore. I just can't. I've held on for so long and I'm not strong enough to hold on any longer."
235,Wishes,"I wish I grew up in a different circumstance. No childhood disability ,two stable and hard-working parents, no repression of sexuality, just a normal healthy past. Now, I have the sins of my past following me into adulthood. Everything I know, I learned from the people around me. I have tried to emotionally break away as far as I can. I am absolutely miserable. I hate living like this. By turning 21 in the coming days, I feel absolutely worthless. I don’t think any sane person could like me/care for me in real life. My closeted sexuality has driven past the state of self-hate to more of a constant mental annoyance anytime I think about it. I have connected with people on here but in real life, it’s like I don’t exist. I have been alone for al of my life. Not even a glimpse of the idea that someone has wanted me. Besides 1 or 2 friends along that way, I have been mostly isolated from the world for as long as I can remember. I feel so wasted. I have so much anger and frustration built up in me. All the emotions bottled up because I have no where to let them out. Listening to music can only soothe for so long. I am on the brink everyday. It’s quite pathetic. Sleeping is the only time I find true peace. I am so scared of what’s ahead of me once if I tie the noose. Man, I am so broken."
236,Too ugly to live lmao,"This is probably gonna sound really pathetic and superficial and stupid but I just need to vent.
I genuinely don't feel like I can keep on living anymore. I'm a 20 yr old woman I know this is probably the best I'll ever look and I'm still disgusting. I have depression and body dysmorphia but I know I'm ugly like my brain makes it a lot but I know it's right I know I'm ugly. I've spent my entire life trying to improve the way I look, lose weight etc but I'm just ugly.
It's weird cos Ive had sex and been on dates but no one ever sticks around and all my friends are so amazing and beautiful. They're all either in pr getting into relationships n I just feel like I'm getting left behind and I'll turn 30 and still be single. Im just gonna always be alone and I don't know how to cope with this and I'd rather just die now then see my life prove my brain right year after year."
237,I have decided how I'm going to do it,My plan is to go the beach alone and enjoy it for as long as I want and maybe cry a little haha. On the way back home I'm going to find a nice quiet street and crash my car. I won't hit anyone else and people will just think of it as a car crash. I'm weirdly relieved that I finally found how I'm going to do it.
238,Everytime with pills I end up with charcoal and sick for fucking days,I know I sound like a pussy but can anyone steer me in the right direction as to how I can do this?  Again I know it is not really pain free I just want to find a way that once I start there is no turning back.
239,Nobody cares about you or your problems,"Not in real life or on social media platforms. The amount of times I’ve looked for help on various mental health subs all to be ignored because I’m not a female. 

In real life nobody even asks if you’re alright or talk to you at all. I dress nice, I smell nice, I take care of my appearance and the only way I could make one single friend at college was by drinking. It would be nice for someone to come to talk to me but nobody ever does.

College/ doctors don’t really care, it’s their job to prevent you from ending your life so they attach themselves to you so you don’t and it’s suffocating. When I emailed my well-being team they wouldn’t stop messaging me and coming to visit my apartment. It didn’t feel natural at all it just felt like “okay you’re not dead bye”. Therapist always watched the clock and I had one single hour to discuss why I felt like shit. After signing up online to 24hour help, I wrote long paragraphs of what my issues were and everything only for the online whatever the fuck person to tell me “yeah you should sign up with your well-being team at uni good luck”

The only people that care is family but it’s the burden of having to tell them what you’re going through. I don’t like seeing people sad because I made them that way. I’m also a terrible person and I’ve affected all my relationships within my family. Yeah they forgave me and stuff but I’m still the same person. I recognize my issues but I can’t even change I don’t know what it is.

I’m really just done with life it’s boring and feels like a nightmare. Everything up to now has just been bad with peaks of okay but never great and good."
240,So I have a date set,and Should I wait until then or just get it over with this weekend or something? I hate waiting for the day to come
241,Keeping strong,"It's getting harder &amp; harder to keep the thoughts down.  The last 2 weeks have been hard for me mentally. 
My one reason to stay is looking less and less like a reason at all. I've told myself to hold on until the new year. To give everyone the gift of life &amp; unconditional love &amp; then part ways. My job here will be done and I could finally rest."
242,I dont know what this place is for.,"But I feel like killing myself around 4~12 hours each day.

Why I hate my life

1. So many transphobes who don't understand I'm a human.
2. Bootlickers and capitalism in general. My mom has a phd, she should not have such a tough time raising me and my sisters. But sure, she shouldve worked harder.
3. Toxic people on the internet, dont you dare tell me to ignore them
4. The girl vs boy meme format. So many people tell me it's just a meme.
5. Global warming.
6. Corrupt EVRYTHING
7. About one friend who would actually be pained by my death
8. I gave up on grades bc I live in South Korea, a country maybe 1/7 of Texas with 36 suicides daily, 19 of them teens (on average duh). No matter how hard I try, the system will always pit me against others that are better than me. Almost all my friends' parents spend nearly a thousand a month on education. And the grading system is literally the hunger games. The top 4% gets an A.
9. I have so many things I'm actually passionate about, but everything costs money. (See #2)
10. So many people dont understand my logic.
11. Idk. I'm lonely and nothing's going right and I dont see my future being all that bright (it takes about and hour of internet research to realize societies are fucked. See #2 again)

Why I didnt kill myself yet.
1. Duh. Because I'm too much of a coward.
2. My dreams are still not dead yet
3. My best friend (=my crush)
4. Family will be sad
5. Bc depression or whatever."
243,An unlucky side effect,I just tried to od and turns out these pills have caffiene in them and man this is a wild time. I dont think i took enough to where ill die but its definitely fuckin me up cause of the caffiene.
244,WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!!!!,
245,"I'm not going to be here to experience guilt, so why can't I just fucking do it?","My mom is dying of cancer and my life just sucks in general. I've been suicidal for a couple of years but I can't just fucking do it because I feel guilty about her having to be around for it but also the rest of my family having to deal with it. But it doesn't fucking matter. I will be gone, it's not like I'll feel guilty, I won't feel anything.

And more importantly death is inevitable and shitty no matter how it comes. Even if I don't kill myself someone else in our family will get sick or die randomly soon after my mom. This is just the shittiness of life. There's nothing selfish about ending your own suffering. What is selfish is people expecting you to stick around for their sake. 

God I just wish I could get this concept through my head so I could finally end it. I feel like I get closer with each passing year, and maybe losing my mom will be the final push."
246,I don’t want to continue,"Everyday I wake up feel like shit. Get up walk to the bus alone like always, and think about suicide. I can see myself hanging from the noose when I really think about it. Depression fucking sucks and with a side of anxiety makes it 10 times worse. I have finials tomorrow through the rest of the week, I know I’m gonna fail a class or 2. I don’t want to seek help because I’m afraid of what my family will think of me. I was supposed to meet with my therapist today and I was going to talk about the stress I’m in but she cancelled due to a meeting. She had to go too. She asked me if I really needed to talk but, instead of saying ‘yes’ I said “oh no I was just wondering if we’re still meeting”. I really should just do it"
247,I don’t want to live,"Nothing works. Therapy doesn’t work, medications don’t work. I don’t want to live. I’m only still here because I don’t want to hurt the ones I love. I’d rather die and just be asleep for eternity."
248,Need help dealing with suicidal thoughts,Hey I’m 18 just finished high school in May. I’ve been depressed since 8th grade. I went to therapy for like two sessions and just couldn’t talk to the therapist about it. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and I’m pretty sure I’m bipolar or have bipolar depression. I’m supposed to take my meds but my mom hasn’t gave me any in so long. It’s not her fault she just is really busy. But I can’t keep a job cause of my suicidal thoughts. They are in my head every single day. Not an hour goes by where I think about taking my life. I know suicide isn’t the answer but I really just want these thoughts to stop. They completely kill my whole mood and I hate it.  Every single day i think about killing myself and I really just want it stop.
249,No excuse to be alive,"Five years depressed. No energy. Nothing helps. The pain keeps getting worse and worse and soon I wont be able to handle it and kill myself. I fantasise about jumping off a really tall bridge, hitting the warm loving outstretched arms of the pavement below, and just feeling the release of all the responsibility and bullshit so I can finally sleep. Im done getting ""better"". Im done ""fighting depression"". I dont know anything but my depression and pain, I am my depression. The pain keeps growing and intensifying somehow it gets worse and its all I can feel. Ill try to feel another emotion but I feel nothing. Its just pain and emptyness. Ive always been lonley and nobody likes me because im too weird, too akward, too boring, too everything.

Tldr On the brink of suicide, walking to a tall bridge soon and killing myself."

251,attemped suicide tonight.,"my boyfriend caught me and stopped me,,, i ripped a shirt and wrapped it around my neck and put it on the bed frame and was just pulling as hard as i could. he was just mad and upset at me. saying how he isn't good enough for me. i just need someone to talk to… he never understands how i feel"
252,Ignore this,"Just cut my neck with a razor and I'm still alive. I can't succeed at anything, even killing myself. Writing this because I can't burden my friends with my problems. Just wish I could fucking end it. So many failed attempts just proves how useless I am."
253,Am I doing something wrong?,So about a month ago I was feeling the worst I had felt in awhile and I figured maybe I should try to get some help then at least i made an attempt to turn my life around. So I went to my mother to ask for some and told her what I've been thinking and she got like really pissed at me for some reason and I honestly regretted saying anything in the first place. (After all I've never been very open about emotions fearing this type of response) Is there something I'm doing wrong? Do some people just react that way? Am I missing something? Cause I tried a super close friend of mine (we're very open with each other and they usually dont lash out like that?) for maybe a bit of advice and they just got super mad aswell. Idk if I had done something or said something?
254,Today I made a step in the right direction.,"I posted here a bit ago, and wanted to update you beautiful people. 

Today I saw my family doctor and got prescribed my antidepressants that I had been on for 3 years, and had been off of for the last 2 years. I used to also see a therapist and psychiatrist, but was tapered off of them at the same time.

I felt like I was going to be taking steps backward by doing it, but now I can see I'm making progress. I had sobbed the whole ride home with my AMAZING mom driving. 

I feel a glimmer of hope. I'm fighting that stupid version of myself that's trying to tell me I'm not going to solve anything. 

Here I go down the road to recovery, for the second time! And there's no shame in that!"
255,"Death, nice to know it’s there","Grandparents pass away, then three cousins, then my first born, then my brother three months later in a long painful death, then diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, then divorced with four kids who moved four hours away and finally an impaired. Do you use helium, gun, sleeping pills and a hose to your exhaust, over shoot my insulin or go out like Robin Williams? I keep going because I hear worse stories than mine and those people are still managing life so thanks for sharing. However it’s nice to know Death is right there."
256,Anybody still here because of their pets?,"My son passed away in September at 44 days old. Right when I gave birth to him and they laid him on my chest I knew life was worth it. But life is cruel and he passed away from SIDS. I don’t want to be on this earth and just want to be up there with my baby boy. But I know I can’t leave my pitbull Fiona. I don’t know what I would do without her. She has always been there for me through the hardest times like being homeless, living in a motel, and losing my son. Does anybody else feel like they want to die but can’t because of their pets? Please let me know that I am not alone in this."
257,i’m so lonely,"i’ve had honestly some of the best news i’ve received in a while and instead of being happy, i feel so alone. i can’t believe this is what my life has come to. i’m so fucking sad, guys."
258,I really think tomorrow is the day. Thanks to everyone who has tried to help me over the years,"When I consider dying, I think about how I'll miss my family, miss time outdoors, my dog etc, the good things. So I shouldnt die right? But life isn't all those good things. In fact, most of my life is just me living a failure and punishing myself and feeling miserable. In fact, even the good things are not great. My dog doesn't love me or understand, I'm just a food giver. The outdoors is cold 3/4 of the year and don't enjoy it anymore. I dont even feel I love or care about my family and that they they love someone that I am not. Life itself is just working all the time mostly. I actually think most people feel the same way but are constantly just distracting and lying to themselves. Netflix, work, food etc. Everyone is alone ultimately and im not in good company. Love is a fiction, look at the divorce rates, I don't believe I love my family, the pain I feel is from selfishness. I am so sick and disgusted with how bad I am.

Anyways. Basically, I've done a lot of thinking and if i don't die, there's no world where it gets better. It's my fault, I'm a stubborn evil piece of shit. I already have decided to keep living the last 365 days and it's not working out. So now I will the other choice for once. I'm glad I don't believe in an afterlife cause I'm hoping I'm just permanently done. So I'm leaning towards death and think it makes sense. I wanted to wait until after the holidays. But I'm in tons of pain and I have all day off tomorrow. My family is going to feel so much pain, it wont make a difference what day it is. And I just want this over with. Even how little I care about the pain my family will go through, is proof of how selfish and evil I am.

So tomorrow, if I'm still the same, why not go to the woods with my gun and end it. I'm scared, it's permanent. I mean really scared but I need to get angry enough at myself to do it. I want to put my money where my mouth is, stop whining and prove how I feel."
259,I can’t do this anymore,"I can’t do this anymore, I can’t do this knowing that tomorrow I’ll wake up and everything will be the same. When I feel worthless, stupid and ashamed. When I’m bullied for my identity and who I want to be. And critiqued on every little thing about myself. I can’t do this."
260,"i cant tell anyone else, so here i am","i’m currently suffering from an eating disorder and to put it bluntly, i feel like i’m going to die. whether it’s from not eating or suicide. i’ve pushed away all my friends, stopped making new ones, failing school, don’t do anything but hang out with my boyfriend or sadly watch tiktoks when he’s too busy for me. i feel like i’ll never be the girl i used to love being, i want it to end"
261,"Death, nice to know it’s there","Grandparents died, shortly after three cousins, then my first born, then three months later my brother in a long painful death, funeral after funeral, then divorced with four beautiful children that moved four hours away. Child support payment hire than most mortgages. Then type 1 diabetes and now an impaired. Of course I think about it. Do I use helium, sleeping pills and a rubber hose to the exhaust, maybe over shoot my insulin or go out like Robin Williams. What keeps me going is stories worse than mine and seeing those people make it. Thanks for sharing and giving hope, but it’s nice to know death is right there."
262,Just want to disappear,"I have lost my life because of them and hate them more then anything.. I can barely function as an adult. My brain is fucked, I can’t drive, I can barely work. I can’t get on disability because that requires you to go see a doctor... I can’t afford a to see doctor!! People say life will challenge you but what decided I deserve to loose everything... I died in 2015 and wish I never came back!!!"
263,Not many options and I’m miserable,"I never post depressing stuff on social media but I really don’t know what to do. I’ve been feeling so alone and empty lately, I don’t know how to take myself outta this hole. I sometimes debate in my head whether or not me just being dead would be a better solution than living on this planet and feeling the way I do. I cry in my pillow every night till I fall asleep, wake up the next morning and feel the same exact way. Nothing excites me and nothing makes me feel the way it used to. I don’t know if I could kill myself because my family would miss me so much. But I can’t help this feeling anymore and I just want to be happy again"
264,I'm not sure if taking trazodone and sertraline together would do the trick..,"My last attempt was in 2015. I promised myself I would never attempt again. Today, I'm breaking that promise. 

I've finally come to the realization that I treat my half brother the same way my step father treated me. I've realized I'm just as emotionally abusive as my step father was when I was younger. In hindsight, I love my brother more than life itself, I've treated him like my own child. But it's some fucked up trauma within me that makes me belittle my brother at any given opportunity. And I hate it.

I hate myself for it. I try so hard not to get upset at him and I do. I put him down when I would ignore these things when my half sister does them. I've never physically abused him the way I was physically abused.. but the things I say are so similar. 

I've also been told I can't graduate till 2021 now.. my financial situation is in ruins.. the guy I'm seeing is distancing himself.. 

So, I'm just at the point where I need the pain to end. My brother knows I'm not my step dads child, hence why I got screamed at and belittled in front of him after I belittled him in front of my mom and aunt."
265,Can I write a will as a college student?,"I'm hurting pretty bad but I'm thinking about writing a will to properly distribute whatever little I buy or have to my family and friends. It will at least make the transition easier. I'll give my xwing miniatures to one of my best friends who also plays the game with me, my switch and laptop to my little brother and whatever money in my bank account to my family or maybe my engineering team as a final gift to them as I haven't been much help to them this semester. Life isn't going to end well for me but I can give whatever I have to others to maybe satisfy them a little."
266,Accomplishments making me feel worse.,"I started a decent job this year, been going to the gym regularly and slowly making progress, started going out more, and trying to talk more and people some interested... but I've never felt worse in my whole life. I don't know if I'm just ungrateful for the things I've achieved, or I'm just afraid these accomplishments will suddenly disappear. I've been disappointed so much and ignored by the people I care about that I don't trust that any of these things will last."
267,When suicide is not an option,"Hi reddit, this is my first post.

Need some advice on what to do. I have everything I should need to be happy yet I am not. My girlfriend and I just got a new puppy and I can’t even get myself to care about her. In fact I kind of hate her. I think I’m bipolar, but I’ve never been diagnosed. I have thought many times about killing myself and lately I’ve been thinking about it a lot more.

However, my gfs best friend committed suicide only two weeks ago. I can’t do the same thing to her it would probably break her. However I want to go. I need a way to do it that seems like an accident. I have thought about swerving into traffic or driving my car over a cliff but those aren’t guaranteed to work. Any ideas would be great thanks guys"
268,Why me,I just wanna fucking die so much. I just relapsed on self harm and i just want to not exist. Im just sitting here in the dark with dried blood on me just laying here. Im just empty and I want to feel something.
269,I'm a fucking disgrace. I don't know what's real and what is not. I'm fucking terrified.,I haven't slept in 4 days or so because of paralyzing fear and stress. I did this to myself. I want to fucking die. I want to cut off all my loved ones and just disappear. I'm lost. I only see pain in my future. I'm a waste of life and a disgrace to my family.
270,I have pain every day,"I've had Crohn's disease the majority of my life. I'm stuck at home sick every day, I have no friends never had a girlfriend. All this pain has taken away my ability to live life I just don't want to be alone but all I can see in the future is the combination of isolation and pain driving me to suicide."
271,Thinking about committing suicide makes me feel happy,"Lately the only thing that’s put a smile on my face is the thought of my committing suicide. When I think about it I get excited. I really wanna take some DMT, lay in the bathtub, listen to some of my favorite music, and then blow my head off. 

However, even though right now the only thing I feel towards the world is pure rage and pain. I know one day I’ll start to feel better, that the pain will subside. That I won’t constantly think everyone wants to hurt me. One day I’ll be a normal person and I can live a normal life."
272,I've never been genuinely told I love you,"The person who said that to me the most was my mother who beat me for years. Each time it was always a fake streched smile with no emotion. The only time there was any emotion in her words at all was when I snapped one day and said I hated her, and she immediately started crying and guilting me until I apologized. I only ever heard my dad say it when my mom died half a year ago, but it was obvious it was just to try to comfort me out of obligation when my mother died. Which is ironic because I felt no sadness when she died...

The only person to ever say those words to me with a sliver of sincerity was my best friends great aunt, but she honestly doesn't know too much about me and what she does know is sad. So she almost certainly feels more pity than anything else towards me."

276,How to help suicidal sibling?,"My brother is 15 and is posting on Facebook that he wants to die, feels unwanted, and similar suicidal things. 

We went to therapy every two weeks but haven’t went last two times because we didn’t have a way to get there, tried antidepressants but he stopped taking them, and now he’s getting really irritated and is angry. 

I don’t know what to do or how to get him to open up to me. Is there any other way of getting help or do I keep pushing for therapy and medication? Is putting him into the hospital for suicide watch okay? I don’t want him to die. Our parents aren’t around to help so it’s just me (25). I’ve been crying almost every day because I’m so exhausted and worried. Please give me advice"
277,Should I get ride to ER or go directly to a mental hospital? Reaching breaking point with mood disorder. Have no health insurance.,
278,Between alcohol and a .40 cal,"I gotta drink to relieve some of the stress, pain, and memories. Its not that the alcohol tales it away I just don't remember thinking about it during this time. I don't think about my insurmountable debt (thanks, college),  the joblessness, poverty, my memories, the constant depression. I've suffered with depression for at least 10 years,  been on every medication you can think of and even been referred to ketamine infusion therapy by my doctor recently only to find out that my insurance straight up refuses to cover it despite my condition. I can feel my sanity just slipping away every second. It's a countdown until I completely lose control of what's left of who I am, and I don't know when it'll hit 0. And it's not just that I feel this way...  It's objectively hopeless.. I need to make 6 consecutive payments to get my loans out of default after years of being on income driven repayment plans, I can't get a job because there just aren't any and I don't have the resources to move to the city... At least here I can somewhat support my family. And I've been trying to get away from depression and overcome it for the last 10 years with only minor progression and constant set backs and relapses. And I believe that the only reason I haven't used my gun is because the alcohol provides some relief. Every time I stop drinking it just gets to the point to where the gun is pointed at my head... Literally, but I can never bring myself to do it no matter how much I want to. 
I don't want to keep going. I have no motivation left to fight this. I don't care about the future anymore. I don't have anything to grasp onto. Fuck...  I don't even remember what happiness is anymore. 
There's a lot more to it. I just needed to vent. I don't really have anyone in my life that I can talk to. Don't have any friends. My wife isn't the most supportive and I often feel worse after talking to her or she escalates it into an argument by screaming and yelling and putting me down. She kills what tiny sliver of hope I manage to obtain... I'm just tired of all of this.  I don't belong in this world. I belong somewhere full of love and a place where I can be myself without having people scream and yell. 
BTW,  I've maxed out the therapy sessions my insurance company allows for the year. Not that they help anyway."
279,I am going to kill myself if I can't get a gf,"Nobody likes me. I'm 24, make good money, I'm smart, but girls do not like me. I'm not a virgin, but every experience so far has ended badly. I just want to find someone who gets me. If this doesn't happen within 1 week from today, I'm blowing my brains out with a shotgun."
280,I have no idea how to help my best friend and it’s killing me.,"My best friend in the world is a lovely autistic and closeted transgirl living halfway across the country in an abusive hyper-religious cult with horrible parents and no options. I have no idea how I can help her. No idea what to do. She’s breaking apart at the seams and I can’t even begin to help her. She sent me this text tonight and I honestly have no idea what to do or say. How to help. I don’t know... if anyone knows how I can save her, even just from herself, please please tell me what to do. 

“I've been feeling really suicidal. Everything is riding on this one diagnosis and then it's riding on getting disability. Neither are likely to happen... and I feel completely worthless, I can't do anything to carry my own weight. My primary creative outlet is gone, I don't know how to keep going. My whole life is being stolen from me, transitioning might as well be a pipe dream. I feel completely inadequate as your friend and I hate myself for feeling jealous over you dating a girl, especially after all my apparently empty talk about how much I want everyone to love you and a lesbian girl to fall in love with you... maybe I've just been projecting this whole time. Either case, I think I'm a horrible friend to you. There's no two ways about it, if I come out I lose every family member and social connection that I have except you and two other people. I'll be dependent on you, I can't just pretend that's not how it'll be. And that'll hold you back until you decide to get rid of me, which if you're in that deep I don't think you will, because I can't take care of myself so you'd just be throwing me out on the street to die. So how again is any of this fair to you? How many relationships that under any other circumstances could've made you so happy will be ruined by me? I'll just get in the way, I'm worthless. It's easy to like me when you're not responsible for my wellbeing. I shouldn't even try to be roommates with you, it's cruel. I'm a piece of shit. But I don't have any prospects, so what's the point of being alive? To be miserable and have no identity or expression until the day I die when I'm buried with the permanent record that I was *deadname*, a cis-male member of a church that kills children and told Hitler his ideas were super cool all so a few people won't be sad? I don't know how I'm supposed to do that. I can't. I want to die, I wish I was never born, I hate being alive. You're the only good thing in my life and everything else is an endless parade of horror. Being alive is the worst experience I can imagine. I want to die. I want to kill myself. Even if I get the diagnosis... it's about 2 years before I can even start saving up. If that even works. The soonest it could happen, I'll be 24, still not transitioning. It can take years for HRT to even make major changes and GCS is so expensive. Hair removal is even more expensive that there's no point in even considering it. I'll never be able to date. No matter what, I'll always have to disclose I'm trans. I'll never be a woman, I'll only ever be a transwoman, so what's even the point of trying. Not to mention voice training, also expensive and the most horrible, dysphoric experience I can imagine. I wish I was dead.”

I don’t know what to do or say anymore. I’m so scared that I’m losing her and nothing in the world would kill me more than that would. She’s my sister, my world, and I can’t lose her. Please, please let me know what I can do."
281,Cannibalistic Urges Towards Women,"Disclaimer: This is NOT a troll post or a joke, so please take it seriously. Thank you for reading. 

So I haven't dated or had sex in a few years now because I have the urge to eat women and I don't want to act on it. What started out as a casual interest in serial killer documentaries has morphed into an unhealthy desire to copy the things that cannibalistic serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish did. I'm no stranger to healthy relationships either - I've dated some wonderful ladies, with each relationship lasting multiple months/years. It was a privilege to learn and grow with all of these women, none of them were ever abusive or cruel towards me, and I always strived to be an absolute gentleman towards them :). 

I think something is psychologically wrong with me though. I grew up with a mom who constantly called me ugly, stupid, worthless, and every other insult under the sun, who would throw things at me and tell me these things since I was a toddler. She would dump my toys out all over the floor and scream at me to pick them up, telling me I was a piece of crap that should get out of her face, she'd say she never wanted to see me again and that she was going to kill herself (she never did), etc. She ended up running a meth den in our house, dealing drugs, stealing, and working as a prostitute. The point I'm trying to make is that I wonder if these childhood experiences have shaped my subconscious outlook towards women. I'm in my early 20s now, and apparently the average serial killer begins harming people around age 28. I DO NOT want to end up doing that. Life is precious, and I care about people too much to follow through with my urges. I just worry that I won't be able to control myself in the future.

Lastly, I really want to go to therapy, but I'm afraid that I'll get involuntarily hospitalized, which I can't financially afford at all. I just dont know what to do and I'm hoping maybe someone out there has been in a similar situation and can offer some advice. It doesn't even have to be cannibal related, you could be a pyromaniac or a kleptomaniac or something. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope everyone has a good week."

283,I just feel like I’m hurting everyone around me. I’ve lost my motivation to live and love any longer.,"I no longer see a point in life. I’ve lost my vision of the future. I know I’m still young, but I don’t even know if getting older will help anything. I’d kill myself right here and now....I’m not going to say that I haven’t tried already....but I can’t. There are people in the world who care about me, and I feel like that’s the problem. People know I’m depressed and they’ve tried helping me so I tried opening up to them....in turn I’ve now given two of my friends depressing thoughts and now they’re likely on the same path I went down two years ago. I tried opening up again, as of seven minutes ago...and now this person I opened up to is crying because of me. I don’t know what I said I feel like something came out wrong and I just hate it all. I hate it. I can’t find help in myself or other people. Everyone I talk to just ends up more hurt than I am. What am I doing wrong? What is there to live for? If these people didn’t care about me...I don’t know. I don’t even know. How long have I been typing this? If my family doesn’t even care about me, why should some random person on reddit even bother if I lived or died? Honestly, I hate my life. I hate this feeling I wake up and go to sleep to every. Single. Day. I feel empty and empty and empty. The task at hand may be complete, but the job is never done. And yet, the simple concept of never-ending work is to fill the absence of all of it. If I didn’t have these people to care about me, I would have already made the cuts or jumped or something. I’ve nothing left to live for in this world for my own life, yet if I die tonight, I’ll have caused even more pain to my friends. Please oh please oh please, some divine being out there, or someone, help me to understand. Why am I here? Why do I hurt everyone? How can I end it all tonight and stop causing this pain to my friends? I just want to bottle everything up and send myself out into the ocean where I can’t hurt anyone else and for no one else to be sad that I’ve gone. Yet I’m eternally shackled here to this planet. So if I’m to stay, then what do I even have to live for?"

285,Regardless of my life condition ill always be depressed,"Lets just say im rich and I can do whatever I want and I have all the people around me that I like. Even then ill be in torment by my own mind by depression, so why does it matter? Why try? What I just mentioned is my ultimate life goal so why even try to go for it? It doesnt matter, I never feel happy in any situation. Ive been depressed for five years and yes ive tried therapy yes ive tried this, that, all of the bullshit doesnt help me. I dont want to keep searching for any longer, im giving up and opting out. The longer I stay alive the worse it gets. Somehow the pain and numbness keep stretching out more and more. I wasnt suicidal everyday when I first started to be depressed, and when I did get my first suicidal thoughts I told my parents everytime. Now its so everyday and regular that telling my parents doesnt matter anymore. The intensity of the pain keeps increasing and all I know is that soon, im going to end it."

287,Can someone here suggest a painless way of doing it,.
288,I’m going to kill myself this weekend.,"I’ve tried counseling, medication, and reaching out to crisis hotlines. None of that can help me. I can’t be honest with any of them. I have to say that I’m not currently planning on killing myself to avoid a police visit— but I am planning on it. I finally found a peaceful way to exit.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m writing here because I want to get things off my chest. I want to tell the whole truth and be heard finally.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a young girl, I was sexually abused by two of my older cousins repeatedly. I thought it was my faut— so I didn’t speak up initially. When I did speak up, my mom was the only one to believe me. My aunt defended her son and my cousins defended their brother. I was labeled a liar and isolated from my family as they preferred to just sweep it under the rug. I became depressed at a young age. When I was older, I was sexually assaulted twice more and said nothing of it because I was too scared.

&amp;#x200B;

My father is a very conceited and selfish person. He begged my mom to get pregnant and began abusing her shortly thereafter. He cheated and told my mom that she was now “stuck” with him. Once I was born, he was very in and out of my life. He made promises that he never kept and he rarey showed up for me. I think it would have been better not knowing him at all. I wouldn’t wonder what was so awful or unimpressive about me that even my dad didn’t think I was good enough. Another parental figure recently came into my life. I kind of viewed her as a second Aunt. In the end, I was rejected by her because she wanted nothing to do with my extended family. She wished the best for me in life but asked that we don’t talk anymore. I was so heartbroken.

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed with learning disabilities in Middle School. They said that I had ADD and slow processing but secretly I think that I was so depressed and traumatized that I couldn’t focus. It hit me especially hard because I was such an advanced learner before. I was an early talker and was always reading above my grade level. It kills me to have potential that I can’t seem to access. I am plagued by this at work as well. I’m often told that I’m “just not catching on quick enough” and have been fired for it. I have so much work anxiety that it makes me physically sick sometimes. It is so hard getting out of bed to go to work when I am anxious and depressed. I feel so relieved when I think about never doing it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my sexual abuse, I find it difficult to be intimate with my boyfriend (who I live with). He gets very frustrated with me because I am sometimes uncomfortable with sex. He has guilted me into it a few times but that just makes it harder to “want to” the next time. It feels like my body is just for someone else’s pleasure. I’ve laid there dissociating several times. I feel broken. We argue a lot and he makes me feel very insecure about my looks. The other day he screamed at me that I was a stupid bitch and told me to shut rhe fuck up. He slams and throws things. I’ve regretted living with him at times but my lease will go on for another 8 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very broke and have no idea what I’m doing with my life. I missed an opportunity for a better life and regret it every day. Christmas is my favorite holiday and I can’t afford to go see my mom who lives in another state. I feel so alone. I don’t think that my life will ever get better. I’ve wasted my money on a college education that has done nothing for me. I am in debt and currently have rent money in my account— nothing more. I plan to leave my boyfriend with next month’s rent. I think it’s a good time to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Counseors always tell me that I’m strong when they hear about some of the things I’ve been through but I disagree. I think all my strength is gone— used up. I think you have to be strong to work hard in order to make it through life. I just don’t have the strength. I give up."

Sorry if it’s a bit incoherent my thoughts are a bit sporadic rn"
292,Ending it Thursday.,"Posting on phone, sorry for format. 


So to start, I've Aspergers, Agoraphobia, and Anxiety in general.i get about 750 SSI. Grateful for that. I cant get an apartment due to income requirements. I cant do random roommates due to disorders, childhood trauma and bad experiences w them before.


I have 2 more days in hotel. This is after SSI and donating my plasma 2x a week past 4 weeks. I've been bouncing between homeless and hotels for roughly 8 months right now. I don't know how to do homeless or where to sleep (cant go to mission. Sexual abuse Trauma. I wig out) so I just walk nonstop for 3 or 4 days, drinking Bang and taking kratom (3 gram doses as needed for energy). In past I've worked it to where I'd homeless 3 days, check in for a day, then repeat. Recently I had ""prospects"" of jobs. 2 temp agencies, McDonalds has told me 3x in 4 weeks ""checking your references!"" As I see them hire ppl every week at open interviews. I'm 33. With 0 friends. No references. Temp agencies have ""log in via text daily for jobs"" there has been a total of 3 job offers available from both places in as many weeks, and I wasnt qualified anyway.


I've been robbed twice, apartment style. Hard to rob an agoraphobic, but these assholes managed to! All I have anymore are my clothes and a small free weight set. No car, too anxious to drive. Thursday I'll have to throw everything out. I had been keeping it in storage but things were looking up and I wanted to get into work shape so I saved storage fee and started exercising. 


This is meandering w unnecessary details. Stream of consciousness.  Sorry.

I just cant do it again. I'm not the ""bring self from bottom to success"" type. I'm extremely neurotic and riddled w disorders, I need a stable environment.  I cant even land a job freshly showered, slept and confident. Going w. O sleep, showers. Etc. Is just a ""struggle to survive so I can do it again and again"". Every month on first due to SSI,cycle resets. But even that is depressing.  Ok. If I survive 12 days w/o food, shelter, desire to live...I can do this all again next month! I don't enjoy or look forward to anything. I have 0 friends and, I know I'm posting here and no offense, don't want anymore online friends. I see people outside all being normal. And it pains me that I can only function via text, that I wont have a wife and kids, friends, anyone. 

I donated plasma today and it was so hard not to break down when she asked ""any plans for holidays?"" 1) no one to plan with 2) I'd already decided to end it Thursday. Weird to pretend that ""yes. I'll certainly be here next Wednesday,  happy, at that!""


This is, again, just a cycle of attempting to tread water for years and... it's just pointless. I realized the only reason I'm alive is because I was in denial about the actuality of anything changing.

Ty for reading. Sorry for mess."
293,I feel like I'm selfish by wanting to end my life I just need to rant to keep me from doing it right now,"I'm an 18 year old male in the US. I actually turned 18 this month. And I feel like ending my life often. Between my bad luck and me being a mean person in the past, it's all coming back to make me suicidal. It started when I was 8 and was molested by a 16 year old guy. I felt like it was my fault and when I found out he was never arrested or even investigated I turned my anger out on others. From the age of 8 to 7th grade I would bully others for being gay because the guy who did those things to me was gay and I had some unfair vendetta. Around 8th grade I mellowed out and actually made my first friends. One ended up being my first girlfriend (who'll I'll call J) but after a few months of dating she dumped me and tried to spread lies about me molesting her which made people hate me. It didn't phase me too much and I kept on not long after I started dating this guy. I couldn't come to terms with the fact that I might like guys because of my past so I used the fact that he was ftm as a crutch. We had our ups and downs but he was all around supportive. I felt so comfortable that he made me come to terms with my bisexuality. Even took my side when another false rumor of me molesting a close friend came up out of nowhere. But one flaw in our relationship stuck out that I didn't pay attention to at the time. I had a hatred for cheaters and he would get angry with me when I mentioned cheating as a general subject. At the time I thought he was just sick of hearing it. Fast forward to just one week before senior year starts. We coincidentally moved out of our old town into the same city around the same time but different schools. He seemed frustrated with me making an offensive joke which was weird because we make offensive jokes all the time. I was just blocked. No warning no message. Just blocked on everything. It made me stressed for a whole month wondering what I did wrong until I noticed one day I was suddenly unblocked on instagram. I went to his profile to message him but I noticed he was dating someone else. Their username in his bio with hearts around it and instagram stories of them. It was something he never did with me. He said he always hated the idea of romantic stuff like that. It broke me down to the point that I refused to eat. I stayed in bed and skipped school and was almost fired from my job for missing so many work days. It was the first time in a long time I attempted suicide. I did it so many times in so many ways but I always messed up in some way. I'm mostly over it now but I'm convinced he cheated on me so seeing articles and videos of people being cheated on makes me have a harsh mix of anger and sadness. I used to make jokes about triggers but cheating is now a trigger to me to the point that I think of every bad moment in my life and feel like killing myself

I'm sorry this is so long but it happened to me again just before writing this out and ranting is my way of coping."
294,I took back the guy who constantly cheats on and lies to me due to my toxic attachment to him. I want to fucking die.,"No one else wants me so I resort to taking him back, yet I feel like utter shit when I do. He cheated on me yet I’m the one who tried to talk things out. He tells me I’m his toy, and that if I don’t want him to cheat I have to prove myself to him. And I just sit by idly and let him do whatever because I love him. I have major fucking psychological problems and I want to go to the mental hospital again so I can get help. Why am I so weak. I want to go buy another rope and do it this time."

297,"I am going to commit suicide, so my inadequacy is beginning to mean nothing to me.","I have multiple ideas for stories I want to write and I fear not having the skill or creativity to bring them to life, interesting characters, plot-points, etc. Now I'm starting to realize...why the fuck should I care? I should just finish at least one of them so prove to myself I can, then fuck on out of here. There's no other reason I should be here, nothing here for me. It's such a relief, actually. 

My works will not be recognized and I'd probably suffer from working for a job I don't care for for the rest of my life. But at least I gave one of them a chance."
298,It’s time.,"Tonight I finally found the right gun for me. In the past few days I made the conscious decision that I will be ending my life with the only way that is near 100% affective. I’ve tried overdosing and hanging myself many many times but it never worked so this is the last stop in the road. 

I haven’t been happy in a long time and I’m ready for my pain to go away. My ex won, I lost. But I’m happy and excited for the upcoming date, it’s the best feeling in the world.

Does anyone have any tips on using a gun for suicide for someone whose never fired a gun before?"
299,Strong but fragile,"My husband and I get into pretty bad arguments..and he has this magical way of convincing me that I'm the one to blame for it all. He does this charming thing with his words to somehow get me to feel like I'm incapable of understanding anything. So charming that even though he's the one who did wrong, I'm blaming myself for it. His serpent tongue is great at making me feel like dust beneath his feet. In fact his tongue is so good at it.... that, I end up feeling guilty and ashamed for all the wrongdoings I've ever made since I married him. 

His love for mean words are so deep, that I have found myself questioning what it would taste like to put a gun in my mouth, and swallow a bullet. The thought sounds so delicious to me, that I find myself craving it. I really should satisfy my craving.... but I don't. 

Why? 

Because if I did, he would..... miss me. And how horrible of a person would I be, to do that to him?"
300,"Update - my experience with text hotlines, crisis call centers and ""211 help - Still Here Unfortunately","This is all over a weeks time, sometimes multiple calls a day.
Been told to kill myself 8 times.
Hung up on 34 times (estimate)
Told by almost all agents (once I figured it out) they're not a help center they're a talk line and provide no real service at all but someone to talk to, and they're rarely empathetic at that.

Finally moved to the help lines.  (Mind you I have enough money and income to pay basic bills).

Most just ring and ring.  They're closed outside of business hours, and only help families get on a waiting list.  Waiting for what I don't know.

Is money no longer exchangeable for goods and services?  I need to start work soon and can't do that without a place to lay my head."

302,Mental Health question about Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS),"Probably an inquiry best suited to another portion of Reddit, but given my thoughts are lingering on suicide I'm putting it here for now.

Has anyone tried TMS as a treatment for depression or OCD? And, if so, did it help you?

Part of me worries about something so intentionally designed to causing lasting changes to my brain, but given the state of my mind I'm not sure such fears are rational."
303,FINALS= Stress= Passive suicidal thoughts,"I keep using the idea of suicide as way cope and a ""option"" to escape....I have ZERO coping skills aside from though of self harm (or doing it) and suicidal thoughts (I imagine death as peaceful and quiet)."
304,"I’m trans, hopeless, &amp; wanna die.","I think I might’ve fucked up &amp; I’d like to die. Judge me if you want. Nothing can make me feel any shittier at this point. I’m a 20 yr old ftm &amp; still live at home. Long story short, I fucked a cis man during a hook up &amp; might’ve gotten pregnant (had unsafe sex on Nov 15th &amp; took Plan B).  This is all of my fault, &amp; I can’t tell my parents this. I never tell them anything &amp; I’m always lying about where I’m at or what I’m doing (it’s easier than trying to converse with them bc they always end up arguing with me or accusing me of something so I always lie instead). They’d flip out &amp; probably kick me out or beat my ass for fucking up this badly. 
Preferably, I’d like to get an abortion ASAP, if I did “fuck up”, but that’s going to be a tough process. I work part time, but I currently only have $100 in my bank account. 

I acknowledge this is my own fault, I have no one to blame but myself, &amp; it’d be shitty of me to just kill myself instead of trying to get an abortion. But I feel so alone in this, &amp; idk what to do. I can’t take this anymore. I have no friends or anyone to help me or to talk to. 
I’m not looking for $ or sympathy. I just needed to get this off my chest, before I really decide to take matters into my own hands &amp; probably off myself once I know for sure. 
I’m a shitty dumb fuck for being so naive &amp; irresponsibly having unprotected sex. I deserve to die anyway."
305,Can’t sleep.,"Every night for hours the same thoughts fly through my head, quick, methods of dying. Gunshot to the head, neck breaking, my throat being slit deep.

306,How do I make my suicide as painless as possible for my parents/family,"Please don’t try to talk me out of it or say “give life a second chance” because I’ve given life about 6 second chances and overall it’s just gotten worse.

307,Ignore Them,"When darkness beckons, when it pulls at your fabric and cuts your strings, remember that you are seldom alone. But a single candle lies within the darkest corners of your mind, warding against distressing impulses and thoughts of self-annihilation. Live through the brutal storm; no winds nor rain to smother your ember. If not for yourself, continue yet for those surrounding you, failure yet blooms in to precious opportunity. As oblivion climbs ever closer in your mind, as your vision dulls, and the deepest mists come upon you; whispers of such destructive acts are worthless, they are little in comparison to your gentle soul."
308,I am destroying my life.,"All my life I have lived to impress my parents, because they we're very emotional unavaible to me when I was little.

 I am in a relationship I don't like anymore, but I can't quit because my gf is emotionally manipulating me to stay everytime.

Also, I am a student because again, I was emotionally manipulated to be. Because its ""good"". I hate the subjects too.

I've started a business too, to impress them, and to give them more money, to help them (my parents and my gf). Ive invested and lost all the money I've worked for last year.

I am so done, I am a slave. I dont care about my family, my boss, my gf at all. I am a coward only working for others and pleasing others. If they would die I wouldnt feel anything. I do all this because of fear. 

I am tired of working till I cant keep my eyes open anymore. And all for others. Please kill me. Or take me away from here, I wouldnt miss a god damn thing or a god damn person.

310,Help me i want to die,"Im a kid from Costa Rica. 14 years old. I feel like everyone hates me. My grades are not good enough for my mom. My parents are divorced and my father can go to jail. They tell me adict because i use my pc 1 hour a day and I feel like there is no one that likes me, im just an obstacle for other people and that if I died then everybody would be better. Please help me. Ive through of suicide variouse times and almost commited it twice. Help!!"
311,My past suicides thought are all caused by my family,"This is the 5th time I have suicide thought and attempting it. All 5 times because of the family I love and hate. My parents are nice, especially my mom, she is too nice that I sometimes take advantage of but I love her. 

My parents had an argument over money two nights ago, and I have been on vsed since then. I havent talk with my mom since then and I feel guilty. I hate her for being so nice to me, I hate the fact that my parents stopped talking to each other but i also love them. I have enough of life, i definitely will miss my life after i leave.

Everything started out with my uncles mental illness, my moms brother. He refuse to take medicine once a while and thinks he helped everyone out and everyone is mistreating him. This is not true, i view him as a piece of human trash that is lazy and worthless life. He has gotten better before and he got married. But after he got married, he became even worse of a person. That was the point when my dad decides to stop helping him, he helped him for over 3 years. The first incident was when he was at our house and flip the table over while we had dinner. My dad and him got into a fight, my mom crying helplessly and i was being an useless son who couldnt anything. I was 13 at that time, my heart was pounding at a very fast rate and i hated that feeling. I hated it and that was my first time having suicide thought.

My mom still has been helping out that worthless uncle. We are a very low income family, and has to financially support a mentally ill person, the burden was all on my moms shoulder, but i hated my him and i hated my mom for helping him out. Last year at the same time i had suicide thought. My uncle is perfectly fine when hes at home like a lazy bum who sleeps 12 hrs a day and all he does is eat and sleep. When he goes to work, he started to act a crazy person and gets fired after a day or 2. My parents had a fight again because my dad cant tolerate him anymore, i was 17.

This year right now. My uncles wife owe my family 5k which she promised to pay back 2 years ago. My dad mentioned it 2 nights ago and called my mom a liar cause she was the one who lend the money to my uncles wife. I dont blame my dad but it broke my moms heart. I didnt feel anything when i heard my mom crying, i was dead inside because i cant deal with this anymore. Maybe because i grew up in a nice family.that spoiled me to not even been able to tolerate things like this. But i just cant deal with this anymore. I hate my mom for helping him out but i also feel sorry for her for having to carry all the burden herself. I think myself as useless human being, who cant even help out his own mom that raised him for 18 years.

This may be my last time posting on reddit. I will remember my past 18 years, even if i quit vsed, i probably wont post anymore. Right now i dont find a meaning to life, i still do what i do everyday, but im refusing food and water"
312,"Suicide has always been my only option, and tonight is finally the night I think","I hate my life and myself and God and my religion, my job, my classes, my state, my clothes, my hair, my body, myself.


I can’t deal with the hatred anymore. Ever since I could remember, suicide has been my “Plan B.” I know it’s “common” to at least jokingly say you’ll kill yourself if XYZ (does not) happens. But I’ve always been serious, but too chicken to go through with it.


I’m full of too much hatred. I’m swallowing 10 tablets of Zoloft then slitting my wrists.

317,i realized that money is the reason i feel suicidal,if would be happy with life if i didn't have to worry about money
318,i feel annoying and like a burden,"i'm not sure what it is but whenever i hang out with friends or text them,i feel like they're just tolerating me. i feel like they just took me in because they felt bad and now they regret it. i feel like they all secretly hate me. when i send something in the group chat people don't reply to what i say. when i make a joke they laugh but it feels forced. i feel that way with everyone i meet. we start off cool and then suddenly i'm always texting first and they don't really want to talk to me. They respond with one word answers and i appear creepy, stalkerish, and too overbearing. i don't know what to do. i feel really lonely. what's wrong with me"
319,I don't think I can make it to the end of the year.,"I'm trying to pour my limited energy into simple, goal-oriented tasks. To distract myself. To find moments of joy.

But...

Every night my thoughts go back to the same place.

My grandfather took his life on Christmas Eve, many years ago - and the way his choice scarred my family haunts me.

I don't want hurt those I love, but I don't feel like I can justify continuing a pained existence I categorically loathe.

Yet I worry that laying down my burden in this way will only place it on the backs of others."
320,Dead tonight,"I’m not writing this as a cry for help but to let you know I’m leaving hell.

I don’t think my family or anyone who physically know me will read this but I want to say I love you mother but I just can’t do this anymore.

This is how I’m going to spend the day.

- Take a long walk and see some nature.

- Visit one of my cousin if she is at her house.

- Visit my father grave.

- Finalize giving away my valued stuffs.

- Return home and organize my room and spend some time with my mother.

- When it’s dark kill myself."

I don't really know what I was looking for when I texted her but I feel worse now than I did before. I just don't want to keep going on and I wish it wasn't christmas time because I don't want to hurt my family too much when I do it. I don't think anyone is going to read this post and it's just going to end up hurting me even more but oh well"
322,why live?,"what's the point? there's nothing to look forward to.

Dear everyone,


I know it’s unexpected, there was a lot going on you didn’t know about. I’m a fucked person, I fucking hate myself, I’m stupid as fuck, known as the kid lost in a cloud, I’m lazy as fuck, so lazy in fact i don’t want to go through the rest of my life. I’d rather be dead then continue on, everyday it’s the same shit, I’m going fucking insane. I don’t want anyone thinking it’s there fault, it’s not. My wick was made short. I’m not even me, I’m already dead. I’m just a thin shell of who I used to be, and i hate it so fucking much, I can’t stand it. I don’t have one care at all, my brain just uses suicide as an escape route in all scenarios. I’m such a fucking disappointment. My parents put so much work into raising me just for me to sit around and get high all day. I legit do not do anything. I’ve made my poor parents cry multiple times and I’ve barely said a word to my dead grandpa who I tried to make it a plan to get closer with. I always have and always will fail to impress. I feel like I’m in a trap, i was born into this world without choice and the only way out is by committing this act which brings down others at the same time. Also why I’m a shitty person, for doing this to everyone. Mom and dad I love you beyond comprehension and I wish the best. I’m sorry I disappointed you guys multiple times, I’m sorry I lied multiple times, I’m sorry I make the shitty decisions I make, and I am so so so sorry I could not return the favor for raising me. I hope you guys understand that life just isn’t the place for me. 

Noah, I know I’m annoying as fuck and I’ve put you through hell, and I hate myself so much for doing it to you. I love you so much though and I hope you know that. Keep doing what your doing, surpass me and do better things. I hope you too understand I was in a great state of pain, I did what I did because I was tired of life. If you don’t understand, some day you will. Love you so much.

Emma, the day i met you very long ago we got along very well. The real me had died some time since, yet we still get along well. I want you to know that you are the only non family member I am writing to. You are the realest person I know, please stay that way, the world has a lack of people like you. I love you so much.

I want to be cremated and the ashes put in a urn. Put it where you want.

Love,

324,Feeling suicidal after my last semester of college. Just want to end it all.,"I just wrapped up finals of my last semester ever and will be getting my bachelors in math &amp;amp; Econ. I’m turning 21 in three days, going on vacation with my best friend in ten, and then when I get back I’m moving to NYC to start a job in finance. Life is good, right?

No. I’m miserable and depressed. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for the past month now. Sorry if this seems rant-ish but I have nobody to talk to and can’t afford a therapist.

This last semester was god awful. I couldn’t afford to live on campus so my only choice was commuting from my moms house two hours away. Well, a week into the semester I totaled my car. I had to rely on Uber, two trains and a bus to get to school each way. My commute increased to 3+ hours each way. I had to wake up at 4 am And I wouldn’t get back until 10 pm - midnight. Many nights I would just sleep on a couch in my schools library. I did this so often that the staff there got to know me and asked me if I was okay multiple times. 

To add to the stress, these aforementioned financial issues motivated me to take seven classes. Yes, seven. I just wanted to be done and graduate. Four of these seven classes were 400-level theoretical math courses. The other three were economics courses. 

And on top of all of this, I was interviewing for jobs like a mad man. Every other week I was flying out to different places to interview. I’ve had to take zeros on multiple homework assignments/quizzes/exams because of this. I had to do a ton of review because I was looking for jobs in finance, and my double major in math and economics taught me NOTHING about finance or modeling. 

There were also various other problems I was having, such as having to get emergency oral surgery and having my drug addicted mother overdose. 

As a result of all of this my GPA for the semester was a 2.8. This made my 3.5 fall to a 3.36. I am completely devastated and I feel like my life is over. 

Call me dramatic, I don’t care. I don’t want to get married or have kids so my career is everything to me. I feel like I fucked up big time and I will never let myself get over this. I want to get into a top MBA program and I feel like my chances are ruined. I also want to get a job in investment banking and I feel like my chances of that are ruined as well, as the GPA cutoff for many positions is a 3.5. I feel like a lazy loser. 

Does anybody else have intense career/school anxiety? How do you deal with it? Asking for a friend Bc I’ve seriously contemplated just killing myself."
325,My biggest regret,I’m 20 now but when I was 18 I really liked this girl and we would talk almost every day and she seemed like she was at least interested in me but I never asked her out because she was 16 and was my friends little sister so I thought it would’ve been too weird but now she’s 18 and she’s even more beautiful and I really regret not asking her out cause now I’m alone and a mess and she’s dating another guy
326,Hey internet,Hey reddit I'm gonna commit suicide soon....so I'm gonna spend my last hour going on Redditch and wattpad and sharpening a knife.....and putting together an outfit.

Spend an eternity in a place where I'm neither sad nor happy? I don't know...but I hope the world gets better without me...Bye

330,Ive had anxiety for years and cant remeber how it feels to be happy,I have depression and bad social anxiety and i cant see shit getting any better.  When i was younger i used to be happy and have hella friends. I was normal back then i didnt care about what ppl thought about me or anything but ever since ive stoped going school my anxiety and depression has just got 10x worse. Ive had bad anxiety for like 2yrs and it jus makes me feel like shit all the time when im out i get scared of seeing people that i know and always feel like I’m being judged idk why i feel like this but it has fucked up my life i used to have confidence when i was younger and not be scared but now anxiety has just took over my life. I dont have suicidal thoughts but i cant see my life getting any better.
331,When the fuck can I give up?,Haven't I been thru enough fucking pain for 1 lifetime? I am done. I can't even pretend any longer.

Everything.

333,"Losing will to live due to shyness, bullying, loneliness","I'm 5'6, in my early 30s, and currently suffer alot from depression, shyness, and social anxiety. It's been said that having good friends is the key to happiness since we're social creatures. But I don't have *any* friends now and it's hard for me to have motivation to live because of this. It's been very difficult for me to make new friends as people my age are married, hangout with their same friends from college and high school, etc. Not to mention that my shyness and social anxiety seem to be due to all the bullying and ostracism I went through in school and in the workplace in my 20s. So people often ignore me, or if they actually end up willing to talk to me, they just treat me like the 3rd-wheel once their other friends join in. I guess they find me boring or not outgoing because I missed out on a ton of social experiences when I was younger. Also, I've never even kissed a girl, let alone had a girlfriend

When I was younger, I was bullied alot in school and the workplace. I had literally no friends in high school. I've never really gotten over it as even today I'm still shy and have social anxiety. Even in my 20s people would mock me and humiliate me in front of others for being quiet, not having friends, never having a girlfriend, etc. It really pisses me off when people are so ignorant and think bullying doesn't even exist after high school. I can't help but feel alot of anger that most people never experienced bullying, don't deal with depression, yet have the nerve to victim-blame those who suffered from it

I tried many things to boost my confidence and social anxiety: Toastmasters, jiu-jitsu, weightlifting, approaching 2000+ women, meditation, traveling to nearly 10 countries, learning a foreign language, playing sports. None of them have seemed to work other than offering maybe some short-term confidence boost. From sports, people don't take me seriously because of my height. From approaching all those women, pretty much none of them led anywhere close to physical intimacy. I asked someone to observe my approaches and give brutally honest feedback, and he said I come across as too nice, shy, softspoken, and passive. He said a fair amount of girls seemed somewhat interested, but many of them would later tell me they had a boyfriend, makeup an excuse to not hangout with me, number flake, etc. He also told me it seemed more girls gave me harsher rejections by flatout ignoring me and being disgusted with me because I was so softspoken and shy

I would say the only thing that helped more than anything was living abroad for a few months because I got alot of attention from people there wanting to practice their English with me. I've looked into how I can live and work there, but it seems the only way it's possible is to take a massive paycut

I already have alot of positive beliefs about myself such as that I take good care of my finances (I have a 6-figure net worth and no debt), I have a decent job, I'm proactive, etc. Yet, that doesn't seem to help with my confidence, social anxiety, shyness, and anger at life for being the one guy who has gotten bullied so much and always struggled with making friends. Those positive things about myself mean nothing to most people as they tend to judge males on their height, how many friends they have, how outgoing they are, etc. Basically all the things I struggle with"
334,Got less than five hours left ... never suicidal before last night. May my loved ones find happiness !,"This thought had not occurred to me until last night. 

I fucked up. My mom made me realize last night that I completely wasted any potential I had... and that makes me feel terrible. I also realized I don’t have what it takes to change. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. Last night was just the worst night of my whole life. I lost my dreams because I was anxious about talking to my English teacher. That isn’t how the story was supposed to go. I was supposed to be somebody. My mom made me realize I can’t be anybody anymore. 

I also had an internet stalker, who had terrorized my life. They texted me for all throughout soccer season, threatening to share explicit photos of me, about half I didn’t know even existed. I couldn’t concentrate on anything else other than them. I spent all of my time texting them, doing whatever I could to make sure they didn’t expose me and ruin my life. They disappeared mid-November, but the threat looms over me. It is a constant reminder that I won’t ever be really secure, as some random person on the internet could destroy my life in any instant. At least worse than I destroyed mine anyway. My pictures and videos now circle some dark web child lesbian porn fantasy, I guess. I don’t want to think about that at all. I guess, when I really think about it, that alone makes me want to die. I wouldn’t have considered myself suicidal until maybe four hours ago, but now more things make me want to end it before it blows in my face. I am sorry I didn’t tell you Mom and Dad. There was nothing you could have done. It wasn’t like I wanted to die for the past three months because of my stalker. The stalker is only a secondary reason. The other reason is that the virtual world is much more entertaining than real life. 

May you all succeed in whatever endeavor you choose. May you all know, life is worth living. I have found such beauty! I just think that eventually the pictures and videos will be leaked, and now I don’t have a T20 school in sight anymore... I won’t make it. I gave it my all, I guess."
335,I just don't know how to get better and i need help,"I dont even know how to start this, but I have just been feeling so bad lately. There was a good couple of years where I was never depressed, never self harmed, never had suicidal thoughts. And its like all of a sudden all of that time off from these things has come back with the strength of 2 years worth. and its everyday. I find joy in literally nothing. I feel so alone. I have a really good partner, but its gotten to a point where I only feel better when they are around, and I dont find that healthy, and she doesnt either. So I just have no one to turn to. I dont have any friends who I can talk to about this stuff, or in general really. And maybe thats why this is so hard, but I just hate it so much. I think about dying every day. I look up ways to do it and go through it step by step in my head. And then whenever I drink i'll end up attempting it but stopping myself. I dont even know if I would actually go through with it or not anymore, but it is still a very presistant thought that goes through my head constantly. I need someone to talk to who can help me, because I really cant stand doing this alone anymore or I am really scared one day I will break and all of these thoughts will turn to reality."
336,Trees are fucking wild man,"God, what gave trees the right to be so god damn beautiful? Fuck. They all just have their shit together and there's nothing anyone can say to fuck with that. Look at them, being a bunch of confident bastards with their leaves and branches and shit. What the fuckkk.... I wish I were a tree. I'd just exist and that's it, that'd be enough. I'd live only to live, my life would be purposeful and God I'd be lovely. Trees don't worry about the future, they don't worry at all, they just are. Trees don't want to kill themselves. Trees don't have the capacity to feel like that. Trees wouldn't hurt eachother. God, I want to be a tree so badly."
337,"Potential Panicked, Spontaneous Sucide","I've been doing great today. I've gotten a lot more done than I've recently had the energy to do, and it's not even that I gathered the energy to do it. There's a chance that I am simply pushing forward so strongly now because of the current reality of my situation.

I've got enough to be depressed as hell about when it comes to my life situation (social, emotional, and mental well-being), and it never has taken too much to trigger my severe depression; however, I just don't care about that shit right now.

For quite a while now, I've been envying the old days of my depression, where I would feel so much emotional pain (sometimes seemingly from nowhere), that just felt like I needed to end it all. It felt urgent because it was a long-lasting, dull pain that just seeped into my soul and tore me down. You all know what that's like who post here. You just can't imagine doing one more day of this. You don't want to wake up. And yet, you can't find the courage to just end it... I've been there. I go there often. I never stopped being suicidal. I just got used to living in a world I didn't want to be in. I kind of accepted it. And actually, there was a short while where these feelings went away.

Now, they're back again, but it's not emotional--that's there, but it's something else--it's the fact that I now am severely in pain as I type this in 2 parts of my body, and in severe discomfort in a third part of my body. One is an actual medical-related phenomenon that I need money to fix, and it has me PANICKED. It isn't that slow, ""I hope I die in my sleep."" It isn't slow at all. It's a manic, severely panicked fight-or-flight response that has me freaking out in my head, just thinking, ""Holy fuck, fuck, fuck, I need to end this shit RIGHT THE FUCK NOW. Don't let yourself go near that \_\_\_\_. Pretend you don't have it.""

Will I survive tonight? Yes.

..I think.. (Yes... Yes, I will...)

..See, that's the thing.. I actually feel mentally stable. I want to live. I have goals in this life. I have for the past 5 years. I just made some stupid choices, and I let a seemingly small health ""thing"" turn into something that has me struggling to not flip the fuck out every damn moment. It's not depression, nor anxiety like I'm used to. It's PURE PANIC... I used to imagine feeling this way, and now I do and I'm not sure I could have anticipated the genuine feeling of it. More than that, I just did not anticipate the why: My health. ..I think I genuinely took that part of life for granted. ""Won't happen to me,"" I said, subconsciously, as I aided this problem of mine until it became nearly incurable.

I'm going to have a new job starting soon, and I'm not sure how I'm going to stay on shift without suddenly speed walking the fuck out of there like a psychopath when this sudden panic hits me.

It would actually probably look pretty funny... ""What the fuck's the matter with him..?"" ... \*shrug\* ... ""Idk, man...""

&amp;#x200B;

It was scary enough wanting to die for most of my life, but to want to live and then see your ability to do so sanely and comfortably taken from you is... Well... Panic-inducing. I just wish I could say that I'm being a big ol' wuss. That's not the case this time, unfortunately...

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it's time for me to go total ZEN mode tonight so that I can hopefully not do some stupid shit.

Anybody got some painkillers? ...Fuck...

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, here's some inspirational shit for those that like that kind of thing:

338,I run out of words when it comes to suicide,Which part of i wanna die no one gets? Cuz seriously it all comes down to it no matter what
339,Who am I actually supposed to talk to,Fuck that suicide hotline they just send cops to your house and then you go to the hospital for a while and there's not a single doubt in my mind it'll make everything 1000% worse. I'm so ready to just fucking end it but nobody cares
340,I Think I'm Going Insane,"From the ages of six to now (I am almost fifteen) I have moved homes about every two years, and my parents are thinking of doing it again this year. I have changed schools almost four times (maybe five, I don't remember), and I'm fucking done. No, neither of my parents were ever in the military. In their words, ""We just get bored."" That's why they move. When I was younger, I went along with it. The last time we moved, I begged we stayed in schools. They complied but were upset with the house they got. Now, they want to move to Pheonix, Arizonia, or somewhere warm. We live in the Midwest so the weather is shit, but they've always moved around in the same area, which is nice. My mom hates her job. She is overworked and wants a new one. My dad's job allows him to live anywhere, so that's nice. I understand my mom, but aren't you going to think about me. Maybe I'm getting the wrong perspective. (certainly biased here)  That's enough backstory, now on the mental health issues:

I've been depressed off and on for about two years now. It started when I decided I was an Atheist, but both of my parents are Catholic. (My mother is much more devout then my father) I hid it pretty well, and they don't know to this day. Next, was my social withdraw. Ever since about seventh grade, I have been slowly turning inward. Now, its gotten to the point where it's painful and boring to speak to people. (Especially small talk) These two things (and so many others) are the reasons why I decided to go to therapy a few weeks ago. The results are mixed so far. I actually feel about as depressed as before, but time will tell. Anyway, previously, I was scared to get help because my father thought that anti-depressants cause children to shoot up schools. He got this information from a Braintbart article. This coupled with him often saying, ""You going to end up in the basement on welfare on those drugs,"" evaded me from getting help. Now, I'm at a low point. I'm cramming for the fucking P.E. final, and I'm going insane. Sunday, I think I had a psychosis event or something, because I saw shadows and heard voices for a few hours. I should tell my therapist that. I've also been watching way too much gore (and reading about cold cases), so I think I'm losing my mind at the moment. Ok so the point:

I am now unable to commit to relationships. Friendships have become very hard to make now due to me having basically two modes when it comes to love: friend and ""I adore you mode."" This is a nightmare. My good friend A (we'll call her that) and I have been texting each other for a while. I first talked to her in 8th grade, and I've had a crush on her off and on ever since. When I started going to high school, I had no classes with her. This was quite depressing, and I resorted to ""inappropriate methods"" of contact. Ok I stalked her throughout the schools. I so very wished to speak to her in person again. I realized that this wasn't working, coupled with a poor geometry grades, a little run in with the law, and a desire for scholarships, I am now attending a Catholic School. I also recently went to A's restaurant, and even though she was sitting there the whole time, I dare not come over to her table and speak to her. I minimally spoke to her. It was a very awkward situation. Now my other friends are slowing drifting away from me, as I am from them. Is it me, or is it getting lonelier out there?"
341,Finances,"So I’ve taken care of all finances and owe nothing. Paid up till july next year. For some reason taking care of this stuff calms me down, makes me feel closer to being free and no guilt about leaving debts to pay. Does anyone know if notaries will take advanced payments that I know whoever takes care of my estate will need to pay? I want it to be as easiest as possible. I know what it’s like, I am settling my husband’s estate. It’s a lot of work. Anyone identify?

I also don’t want to raise any flags but if you can prepay your funeral, your notary shouldn’t be any different?"
342,I think I am going to kill myself in three years,"The title says it all.

I just can't see myself past these three years. I'm too weak for this world.  Everything in this world is *bleak*. There's no purpose for me in this world, I mean, what am I?  I'm just a second choice. 

 I can't even express how much I hate myself. 

I'm not a good artist, student, nor daughter. I'm just a waste of space that should go for people who really needed, people who will push our society into a bright future. 

Death is so tempting, for five years I've been obsessed with death. It's such a pleasant thought. Passing into an unknown world forever and not being remembered by anyone."
343,I’m going to end my pain next month,"I’ve tried so hard, but living the past 3-4 years with this depression I just can’t do it anymore. I really have tried. 

I had an 8 month relationship which ended in July. That’s not the reason, it was actually a nice ‘distraction’ from my depression, almost like a beautiful dream but when it ended I crashed back down to reality. 

I feel guilty because so many people would do anything for aspects of my life - a few months away from graduating with a psychology degree, not having to worry about anything financially, lucky enough to go on luxurious holidays with my family every year. Fortunate enough to have been able to see a private therapist for the past few months. Heck my football team Liverpool looks like they will win the Premier League for the first time in my life. 

But even  all of that’s not enough to stop me feeling like this. I’m too far gone, too depressed, too lonely. I’m 22 and I am so fucking lonely. 

I can’t end my life now because it would ruin ever future Christmas for my family. So at the end of next month I’ve decided I’m finally ending the pain, I’ve also planned a backup date in February. It’s a decision I can’t be talked out of. 

So yeah. Nobody knows and I guess I just wanted somebody to know. This community is truly beautiful. And I’m so sorry."
344,Is a spring powered air gun deadly?,"The more I think about it, the more I'm thinking it may not be a smart idea for me to have bought this gun *for camping*. I'm curious as to if it can actually cause deadly harm or if it would be safe to keep.

345,How to change my will?,Title said it all.
346,I can't handle it anymore: without meds and on the verge,"Well, I can't handle anymore. I'm without my meds (I take Valproate, Sertraline, Olanzapine and Clonazepam) and my mother doesn't want to buy them. She alleges we have no money even though my dad, since he has ran away from home (for the third time in this year), has wired us some -- she and my sister have spent some money on sneakers, tattoos and on their fingernails. On this Sunday, my sister (she's 15 and I'm 17) did beat me. I felt humilliated and surer of my suicide and I felt even more humilliated today when my mother joked about how often my sister beat me -- I feel specially sad when my sister treats me like that because I tried to get some help for her and I even got her a transfer to a nice school (which she rejected). I don't want her to lick my boots, but I just want her to act more decently with me. I mean, one week after they found out I was suicidal, they badmouthed me to some cousins, knowing that I was hearing it all -- my mother said I was like ""God's punishment"". I can't really handle it anymore. I thought of being commited to a psych ward, but my mother said she doubted I would even kill myself, even though both my therapist and my psychiatrist recommended it I tried talking to my psychiatrist about it but all she said was that she couldn't do much and that things would get better. Besides my father (who's got Bipolar and is addicted to Clonazepam), who has ran away (although I don't blame him for doing so, once my mom planned to kill him with her lover and she recently invented that I had tried to kill myself by jumping in the middle of a busy avenue and tried to guilt-trip him with this), my mom (who's got Bipolar and BPD), and my sister, I have some half-siblings. The one who I tried to reach out and who even offered me a hand, disowned me (""you should forget I exist u/souththroaway), promised me suffering (""you will now know suffering"") and called the cops on us out of hate for my mother. I thought I had any friends but after high school finished this month (I lived in the Southern Hemisphere), they simply forget about me. It bothers me that it seems that in seventeen years, nobody has loved me. It bothers me that I'm not sure if everything is real or not. Everything bothers me."
347,"It's time, boys.",It's over for me.
348,december,"i relapsed on xanax yesterday. was 10 months clean too. my depression has gotten so much fucking worse. stress from school, my abusive family, and dysphoria are really close to pushing me over the fucking edge. been considering taking the last of my xanax supply (ab 40-50 pills) and just finally leaving."
349,Going trough divorce,"Hi , please note that English is a second language form me so I will do some mistakes.

So about 5 weeks ago my wife (31f) and I (32m) decided to end our relationship. The main reason is that in the last two years we got further form each other, we taken less care for each other and less interest in the project of the other. And at the  end we where more like friends who have sex than a real couple.  But damn this is hard , even if I know that our relationship was not what it should have been , I feel so depressed .  We have 3 girls that I love so much and they are the only reason that I didn't already hang myself. I have a couple of great friends , a really good job , I know I should not feel like that but I can't stop thinking about hanging me .  I know that there a lot of things that I should have done that I didn't and now it's too late . I asked here to try one last time , I wrote her a letter with all the things that I would change but she said she didn't want any of that anymore. When I get home after work all I do is crying .  I feel so freaking lost ."
350,i don’t see the point,"i’ve been struggling for days with deciding what to do with myself. i’m only young (16) but the positives of life have always been outweighed by the negatives and i’m feeling like there’s no reason for me to keep living as of now. i’ve sat on my kitchen floor with my bottle of antidepressants in hand multiple days this week and i honestly don’t fucking know why i haven’t done it yet. everything is stressful and i feel hated and disgusting. all of the shit from when i was younger is coming back to me and i really do feel like i should follow in the steps of my mom and attempt because there’s no better option at this point. any of the reasons that used to drive me to keep surviving feel bitter and useless now. 

i’m so loosely hanging on to my will to live and the mood swings that come with my personality disorder are too severe to handle and god i just want to fucking disappear! the only reason i haven’t downed that fucking bottle by now is because of the fact that it’s near christmas and i can’t ruin this for my loved ones. i don’t know when i’ll die but i hope it’s soon because i don’t know how long i can take my mind tormenting me like this anymore. i feel sick and like i want to rip my lungs out. my default is despair and i just want to FUCKING DIE"
351,Too knowledgeable for my own good,"I’m close to 30. The first time I tried to kill myself I was 12. I’ve struggled with bipolar depression and suicide for nearly 18 years... 

After the first attempt I’ve tried 4 more times. 

However, I’m considered “high functioning” and a “mental health success story”. I have a master’s degree and I work in the mental health field. Yes I’m the walking stereotype that can help everyone but herself. 

All I know is that now I’ve found a fool-proof method. It is the same method I’ve seen 2 others use in my line of work... they are both dead now. I’m so tired of fighting this. I’m so tired of the constant ups and devastating downs. I’m unhappy with my relationship but cannot bring myself to break my partner’s heart. And even if I became single again, no one would want me anyway, not with my diagnosis and the self-harm scars all over my arms. I just have to get up the nerve (or the mania again) to try one more time..."
352,I am so exhausted with existing,"I just got into a wreck tonight. Didnt see a mail truck coming in the night and it scraped the front of my car and dented their fender. And I desperately want to die. Ive never been in a wreck and now the car that im supposed to sell this month has its first accident on its record and i hate myself. Im new to the area, lived here 6 months and im 6 months into a job that i have grown to hate. Every work day is miserable, every happy day is fleeting, over time ive slipped back into a severe depression. Last night i talked it out with a good friend on the phone and i was actually having a good day and on my way home for a spa night because i had earned it. Instead i wish i wasnt tethered to people and could actually kill myself. Im writing it on here because i have no one to talk to, my parents will lock me up again, they already berated me for being overly emotional, and my friends will think im unstable. Im tired of being a lazy, useless, fuckup who hates every day im alive. When i think about the comments at work about the scrape, about the intrusive thoughts about it that will plague me for the next few years i just want to die now."
353,Confession,"I'm sorry.

I guess that's a good place to start. I'm sorry for a lot of things and to a lot of people. I never thought I'd have this many regrets as a 29 year old, but here I am.

I'm sorry to my parents first of all. I'm sorry I took every opportunity you gave me and ruined it. I'm sorry I left the military. I'm sorry I never went further with my education. I'm sorry I gave up on all my dreams. I'm sorry I lie to you constantly. I'm sorry I let you and my siblings down. I know you're disappointed in me. I know that deep down inside, me being gone will be a relief. I'm sorry I failed you as a daughter.

I'm sorry to my friends that I abandoned over time. The projects I gave up on and left you to handle. The weddings and birthdays and moments that I missed because I was too depressed, sick, or scared to attend. I was a bad friend. I'm sure it was embarrassing to be around me. I was such a mess, always trying to get your attention and ask for help I didn't deserve. You all deserve so much better. I hope you all know that.

I'm sorry to my boyfriend for being a shit girlfriend. For not working harder to make you feel loved. For not getting sober so that maybe you could follow. I'm sorry I never loved you the way that you deserved. I know that you have a life that you can lead elsewhere with your family. I hope it makes you happy.

I don't feel sad anymore. I don't feel anything. I just feel... Numb. Every time I fall just a little further, every time I hurt myself just that much more, it doesn't scare me anymore. None of this does. I think I've already died a long time ago and I'm just a husk. 

This life has taken so much from me. All I have to give back is my life.

So I'm sorry."
354,I need to accept the fact that no one actually cares if I kill myself,I post on subs like this basically begging for attention but it's useless. It doesn't change anything. I'm a sick person and no one would ever want to be friends with me
355,I wish I had the guts to just do it,"I promised myself when I was 16 that I wouldn’t let myself live until I was 18 yet here I am, 18 years old and still breathing because I’m a coward.
I used to be reasonably hopeful and optimistic, but the older I get, the less I see a point to anything at all. I have severe social anxiety that has caused me to be home bound most of the time and I rarely have human contact because the thought of being seen or judged is debilitating. Pathetic, I know, but I don’t know how not to be this way. My family has reaped the consequences of my mental health for years (I’ve been receiving treatment on and off since age 12) and nothing has helped. I’ve only gotten worse and I feel so guilty for putting them through it. I’ve become so numb to the thought of dying, but I can’t bring myself to finally do it. It feels expected, almost. Like they probably wish I would’ve done it at age 13. I wish I had. It would’ve saved them so much stress and disappointment. I don’t believe I’ll ever be able to function normally in society and I know for a fact that I am going to kill myself one day, I just don’t know when. Hopefully soon. I wish something would happen or that someone would come along and do it for me. I can’t live like this anymore. I feel trapped and useless. I don’t have anyone anymore because of my isolation, and all I do is stress everyone out. I’m a walking disorder that my parents feel ashamed to speak about. I have no accomplishments, just a bunch of mental health issues. They’re waiting for me to magically get better and be fully functioning but I don’t think I am even capable of that anymore. They don’t deserve to have such a failure of a daughter. I don’t know what to do anymore."
356,I give up.,"Its been too long. My life hasnt improved after 3 years. Im stuck in a loop of daily humiliation, discomfort and loneliness along with no qualifications or skills. I hate myself. My family dont care about me unless its trying to get me put in hospital for how i feel. I havent truly spoke to them for months now. I dont see my child. 

I dont feel. I just act. Ive realised i laugh eith my friends because they do. I wont tell them my feelings because who cares. They sure dont. I have no one to turn to but myself and thats only made me feel not real. Im not me. I dont feel like me. I dont feel like shit.

Whenether i leave the house i physically cant do it and go back home to sleep or waste away at a desk to try and ignore my feelings. I feel sad. I feel hurt like im constantly in pain. Whenether i hold a knife or weapon i just want to kill myself. I think of it daily. All day. I have breakdowns and sometimes just collapse. I cant do it. I want to die. I give up. I shouldnt be alive. I dont want life. I want to be gone. To not exist.

Thanks for just letting me put this somewhere. Since im too much of a coward to do it. Despite my numerous attempts i cant fucking do it. If you read this. I guess thanks.. Someone listened to my shit."

359,Suicidal Brother - how can I help? Can I help?,"I love my brother (32) dearly ... he is the funniest, smartest person I know.

He has battled depression, rage and dark thoughts for as long as I can remember. 

I've always been optimistic - dreaming of a day that he'll find some happiness and his self-worth. He deserves it.

Recently though, I too have become hopeless ... I see so much pain in him ... some days there's no life in his eyes. It's awful but I feel like we're waiting for the inevitable ... just a matter of when.

I don't know what to do and I'm scared as hell ... I've tried talking to him but he barely opens up and when he does... he just cries. I wish he could get help... but I don't  even know what help looks like. 

What do I do?"
360,I just want this pain to end.,"Only reason I haven't done it would be because if my parents.. they put so much effort into raising me and my siblings.. I can't do this to them. So I suffer silently. 

But right now, the past couple months have been the worst moments of my life. I just want to vanish, just die immediately. Not have to think or feel about it... I can't hold myself up... My heart hurts, stabbing pain in my stomach and head... I can't sleep. 

I would pay someone to end my life right about now. It's absolutely fucking shit."

362,I'm ready to say goodbye.,"This month marks the ten year anniversary of when I can remember first feeling depressed. I was 12 and didn't quite understand what depression was. I just knew I was sad, and that there wasn't seemingly a reason for it. I told myself it'll pass, and in a few weeks in the new year I'd be happy again. I was sure of it. A few weeks passed, and I only felt more sad. Sad at the fact that I was still sad. Sad I was alive. Just sad. I started to think about how I wouldn't care if somethinf happened to me that would cause me to die. I recognized that that probably isn't normal thinking for a 12 year old, but what did it matter? Nothing felt like it mattered, so why should that? I was in 7th grade at the time of this, and two years later, shortly after turning 14 and entering high school, i started getting bullied. It wasn't as bad as other kids I've heard about. Heck, we watched videos about bullying in middle school, and I felt like what I was going through was nothing compared to them. But it still hurt. And it made me even more depressed. Why should I feel so hurt over what I was going through when there are plenty of kids that have to go through so much worse? But when you already feel like you have no worth, and then practically being shown by others that you have no worth, honestly just sucks. And then this is when things really took a turn for the worse. I developed an anxiety disorder out of the fear of going to school and being bullied. I started getting sick to my stomach every morning, and sometimes not even being able to make it to school. I was 14 years old, not even half way through my first year of highschool, and I was already willing to say goodbye to the world. It wasn't my normal, I wouldn't exactly care if I died, type of thinking. It was taking a bottle of pills to my room at night after my parents and siblings went to sleep type of thinking. I legitimately did not want to make it to another year, just for things to get worse. I wrote a letter for my family and kept it with me every night, hoping I'd finally just end my life and end my pain. For whatever reason, I never did, even though I truly felt like nothing was going to get better. I felt truly hopeless. About a year and a half later, just over halfway through my sophomore year and early in the spring, I broke down and told my mom I couldn't go to school anymore and that I needed to do some sort of online option instead. She talked to my dad about it, and neither of them wanted to let me. Instead, they thought we should just go talk to the school. It was a private catholic school, and the majority of those that bullied me were on various sports teams. I don't remember what his title was, but he handled student related issues, like if they were late too much and what not, as well as was the male baseball team's head coach. We talked with him, and my guidance counselor. He couldn't believe that any of his ""boys"" would do such a thing, and practically called me a liar in front of my mother, and told me I needed to just go to class. I hate being angry, but I was furious. I walked out of his office and started to walk to my class. I started tearing up on my way there, and as I was about to open the door, I froze for a minute, and then turnes around and walked back to his office where my mother was still talking to them. I told them I couldn't go to class, and he told me to get to class right now before he called the police on me for truancy. Out of disbelief I said what the fuck? Being the first time I had ever cursed in front of my mother. Then I told him to do it and walked out of the building and walked home, I live about a 5 minute walk from the school. My mother called me while I was walking home because she was obviously worried about where I had gone because she expected me to be waiting outside for her, and I told her. She came home and we talked briefly and I told her more about what was going on in my brain, although I didn't tell her quite how bad it was, and she reluctantly agreed to let me try some sort of online schooling as long as I would start seeing a doctor and/or therapist to try and get help for my feelings. I didn't like feeling the way I felt, so of course I'd take help. It didn't help, though, and all it did was make me feel more hopeless. I finished my sophomore year online, started my junior year online and found myself having a difficult time being able to focus on my schoolwork because every other thought in my head was something along the lines of, why am I even trying this, I jusr want to kill myself. I scraped by and barely finished my junior year online, and then comes my senior year. It was even worse, and I couldn't finish it. I essentially dropped out of my senior year halfway through. Now I'd need to get my GED, which realistically wouldn't be an issue for me because I was always a straight A student, and I have medicine to help me focus now. But I can't see the point. In the almost 7 years of seeing various doctors and therapists, I'm only getting worse. I also never got my license purely due to the fact that I probably wouldn't be able to stop myself from intentionally getting in an accident hoping to kill myself, just so that my parents wouldn't know I killed myself and have that kind of guilt hanging over their heads. My life has been on hold for so long because I don't want it to continue in the first place, and it honestly seems like there's no way out anymore, even if I managed to get my anxiety disorder under control and didn't want to kill myself 98% of the time. So what's even the point anymore? The life I'd be able to have isn't one I'd want to live. The life I do have isn't one I want to live. I feel more hopeless than ever and I've finally decided this is going to be the year I finally don't make it to the next. I've been working on writing another letter for my nephew. I just can't do this anymore. I'm ready to say goodbye."
363,going to be 35 in few days,"feel like ending my life. i spend the thanksgiving alone and i'll be spending Christmas alone as well. i have a learning disability so i can't ever seem to make good money. i'm going to be 35yrs old with nothing on my name, i'm very lonely and feel like ending it all."
364,"When they tell you it’ll be okay, is it true? What is the truth?","Have you seen people give reasons to live on here and thought that it wasn’t enough? Maybe that it was just wishful thinking?

Maybe it’s because you are.

I’ve heard many stories and read many posts from people here. Support is great and all, but what is the truth? Have you ever found yourself wanting to kill yourself so badly, but just couldn’t bring yourself to slice your stomach open with a knife that moment? Are you a coward? Are you only seeking attention? What are you waiting for? Why is it that you feel like something isn’t quite right, like the answers are right in front of you but it feels like something is missing? 

No, the truth is you knew the answers all along, you just didn’t want to believe them. You spend your time on this site searching for the answer to your problems, when in reality, you knew the answer from the very beginning. You turn your head away from the thing you hope and wish isn’t true. Now it’s time to face them.

I know why. I know the truth. Here are your answers.

You feel desperately alone because you ARE. There may be people on this site who are just like you, you will never meet them. The people around you will never understand what you are going through for the rest of your life. You may not be alone here, but in the real world, you are and will mostly likely always be alone.

Life will not get better over time and time cannot heal all of your wounds. Do you think that something good will happen in the future that will change your mind, maybe you’ll find love or become successful? Will either of these things, even if you get them, REALLY solve your problems? Look around you, someone out there loves you, and yet it’s not enough. Do you think that when you are successful, you will stop working hard? Sorry bud, not gonna happen. Do you think that someone out there knows the meaning to life, and will someday pass that knowledge over to you? They do not have the answers, they are no different from yourself. Do you think you can move past your trauma? It is a part of you now, whether you like it or not.

Do you hesitate to ask for help when you need it, even though you know others are willing to help you? It’s because you know that you are a burden. They may help you for a long time, maybe even years, but eventually they will get fed up with you and come to resent you. This will not end because you don’t even have the desire to get out of bed anymore. No ambitions, no motivation, just a desire for the pain to go away, but it follows you. Life is too hard for you, and you will force someone else to live it for you. They will eventually feel the weight of you and shake you off.

Are you hesitating because of god and heaven? They don’t exist. No good god would allow the things that happen in this world to happen. There is nothing after death, you are the same as any deer that is killed in the wild. You go from dreams and ambitions to worthless nothing.

My name is Jay Fargon, I am a 21 M who has survived a serious suicide attempt. I have been suicidal for too long now, and yet I’m still here typing this. It’s because I’m afraid of the pain of dying. The sensation of dying is extremely unpleasant, but I will get over this fear one day when my pain is at its climax. 

I write to you, the other suicidal person across the world from me, seeking the answers to your questions. Here they are. Good luck."
365,I really wanna just die,"But I can't cauee everything I can think of ends in a painful death not a painless one 
My asthma got 200% worse from a few years ago and my wheezing is silent and I can't go to bed without fucking gasping for air so I have to use my inhaler I'm thinking it was my brother who didn't care for my well being and just fucking smoked weed inside then said ok I'll smoke outside than it went into my fucking Windows I get hungry every hour cause my body is shitty and I hit puberty at very late 17 I'm currently 20 and why can't my body just finish fucking growing my skin gets dry 1000% faster than everyone else's I'm actually the most numb skulled human ever who can't finish G.E it's like I need a tutor to tell me the answers and it still would make 0 fucking sense to me"
366,"How bad I need to be, for be considered bad","I'm not talking about sadness, just a litle
Why is everyone with depression, everyone is sad, everyone can talk about this to their friends. 
But I can't, why do I don't have friends to talk about life, why do I need to imagine having friends and chats with them, why do I not care about grades or pain, why do I want what everyone has, why no one sees me and understands me
Idc a ou grades or pain or friends, I just want to die, and not live, I want to be in the absulute silence, lonely, and not thinking"
367,Suicide,"I don’t really no how to begin this.. theirs no good way to tell someone you want to kill yourself.. I’m 18 and most of you will probably say my life’s just beginning but truthfully it doesn’t feel like it and my self confidence is non existent. 

I’ve attempted suicide on 3 different occasions, each time I was home alone and no one ever found out. I suck so bad I can’t even die correctly... and have felt this way for as long as I can remember not a go goes by where I don’t think of a way to end my life... I’ve been to my doctor on multiple occasions who said they’d refer me over for help.. every time I never heard back.. my school ignored me for ages until one day I had a panic attack and fainted... 

Many of you will say find why you’re like this and try and fix yourself that way.. but already know. My father as long as I can remember, my father has called me names and made fun of me calling me fat, retarded, ugly, stupid lots of really degrading names that lowered my self confidence. It wasn’t even occasional it was every day of my life he bullied me. I could never feel proud of my achievements because to him it was never good enough he would always compare me to someone else and tell me to be more like then even when I did the best I could. He made me feel inferior to my younger siblings and would make me do many of the house hold chores even back in primary school and would ground me for months in end if I didn’t. This meant if I was running late for school one morning and didn’t have time to clean everyone’s dishes.. even his I was grounded and shouted at. Oh and he wouldn’t let in my own garden while I was grounded.. I wasn’t even allowed to watch any tv even if someone else had put it on. He even extended my punishment if I took more than 15 mintues to get home from school meaning I had to run home everyday to avoid getting in trouble. So if The teacher kept us a few mintues after school or I had to ask my friends for something I would be royally screwed. My dad was so strict I felt like I was deprived of my child hood we weren’t allowed to play any games, when laughing and joking around with my siblings he would tell us to shut the f**k up etc. I wasn’t even allowed to watch cartoons such as spongebob or the simpsons as my dad didn’t like to hear them as they annoyed him so I grew out of them pretty early maybe like 8years old. I got my first boyfriend at 15 when my dad heard he freaked out and had ago at me because ‘his daughter was going to some random guys house’ I was simply walking him home to be nice I had no intention of going in.. there’s loads more my dad said and did.. but everything my dad did to me encouraged my siblings to do the same. 

My dad after realising how much he’d effected me after a huge argument with my mum got pissed up for the biggest and sharpest knife in the kitchen and told me to stab him.. I didn’t do it and he was ripping out wires from the wall and tying nooses  to kill himself. Which hours later turned to him trying to bash down my mums door and hurt us and my siblings.. that was an eventful night and I won’t cover that all here.. 

He split up with my mum not long after that due to alcoholism etc. He then continued to be a raging alcoholic and was admitted to a psych ward for help serval times. But he didn’t want it. We did everything in our power to help him but he refused. He commuted suicide last year 3 days before my birthday.. and while I miss him I’m glad he can’t do himself and others harm anymore.

But since my parents broke up around 2 years ago, my mum became an alcoholic as well she went to the pub every night came home wasted. Which was seen okay at the start because she was grieving but even now 2 years later she’s out most nights. And pays very little attention to her kids spending all her money on booze in my opinion she shouldn’t have kids.. her go to is take aways and she has openly admitted on one occasion that she hates being around us and she she’s always at the pub because she doesn’t want to be at home where we are. 

I dated the boy previously mentioned for almost a year and while he wasn’t emotionally abusive like my dad he was sexually abusive... he would often force me into situations I didn’t want to be in and made me uncomfortable. He would guilt me and keep asking me dozens of times until he got a yes from me which it was still clear I was uncomfortable he would also often put his hand down my pants in which I would take it out and he would put it back in.. I won’t go into too  this happened on many many  occasions but I was to scared to speak up or leaving as I didn’t want to look like a slut. I was 15/16 when all of this occurred he was 18.. 

I haven’t spoken to to my ex since the break up, but I often see him around college which is very triggering for me as it can bring up memories which I pefer to keep down. 

As well as this I have lost of all my friends and have no one at all to talk to as my self confidence is so low.. and no one really likes me... I don’t even have a best friend.. 

There’s so much I could add to this list but I’ve kept you here long enough."
368,What is the best treatment for someone who wants to die ?,"Other than pills and therapy. What are some aggressive treatments? I’ve tried ketamine iv therapy but haven’t disassociated even at 200mg.  I’ve heard of EMDR but o don’t know.

If I don’t find something to help, I plan on killing myself 3 months from today. So help? Is there a better reddit to ask about this?"
369,I’m going insane,"I need some help. Some advice. Anything. I’m broken. I’m severely depressed. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and have been taking meds for the past month and a half now. They aren’t working. I’m starting to shut down again for like the 15th time in my life and crumble and fall apart. I can barely keep it together at work and do my job and I’m getting hella shit from my boss for it. All I want to do is just be at home and be by myself. I’m extremely suicidal man and sometimes it really makes me tear up. I’m so existential. Nothing makes sense to me anymore. Everything is gray to me. I’m becoming so sad that I’m LOSING my MIND. Like have you ever just felt like you were going crazy? Everyday I just feel like my heart is breaking and I’m losing my mind. The main thing I’m focused on right now is switching my meds out with something else. The psychiatrist I saw recommended I wait until January to change medication because she wants me to still give it a chance. At this point though, medication is my only hope because that’s the only thing that’s going to save me. Last night I cried so hard snot was coming from my nose and my head started to hurt and I just felt like I couldn’t breathe. And I just prayed to god. I just asked god to help take the pain away. I can’t even count on two hands how many times I’ve cried like that. How many times I’ve asked god/the universe/anyone and anything to just spare me and help end my life. I don’t think anyone out there should have to experience that type of pain. Is life truly worth living? I feel like I’m rotting from the inside out. I feel dead, like a zombie. A zombie that can’t turn back into a human being. How do I get out of this hole?"
370,Is there a sub to discuss suicide methods,
371,Help please,"Hi,

I’m 22, 4 months ago my best friend (mates since we were 4) killed himself, Although we spoke regularly about our lives and daily struggles,  this was completely out of the blue. 

I carry this weight on my back and in the months following everything turned to shit. I quit my job, my car broke, my laptop broke, my phone broke. Couldn’t afford to fix anything, or pay my rent or even get out of bed. With the burden of my best mates death on my shoulders, I hit rock bottom. 

Recently I have begun pulling myself together with the help of friends and family and have gotten a new job and been given a shitty phone to organise my life with. Despite things looking up I still just want to die. My main pillar of support was a girl I was seeing at the time of his death, she’d been great to me but recently cut ties, I understand her reasons and there’s no resentment or bad blood but my beacon of light in all this darkness has gone. 

I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts every day since his passing, it’s horrible. I know for a fact I’d never have the balls to do it, having lived through the experience of losing my closest friend and seen what it has done to those close to us and both my family and his; I know I could never go through with it. It would be too selfish. 

But god do I want to die. I’m riddled with guilt and depression (I was in a shitty with him in his last days as he’d done something foolish that upset me on a night out days before he killed himself) but ultimately just want to be with my main man, my brother. 

Please people of reddit, how do I continue, I struggle incredibly with opening up about these things and although being an extremely confident prior to these events, I’m now riddled with anxiety and don’t have the balls to see a shrink. 

Any advice in finding enjoyment in life again would be wonderful, or those who have come out the other side, how did you do it?

Thanks 

TLDR: my best friend killed himself and I want to die."
372,My moms the only one keeping me on this earth at this point,"If I didnt feel the need to protect and comfort her, I would have killed myself a few years ago. My father's encouraged me to go through with it (despite the fact that when he brings up suicidal thoughts, I do my best to reassure him that hes loved), and my brother trivializes my mental illness, slowly becoming a second version of our dad. My mom is basically the one good thing in my life, and she's confided in me that me and my brother are the only good thing in hers. Every single night I fantasize about the ways I would end my life, thinking of the easiest method that would be the least traumatic for my family. But I just cant go through with it. The pain of thinking about what it would do to my mom just slightly overrides the pain of my existence. One day I pray me and her can get out of this toxic hell hole, and I can finally remember what it's like to want to be alive. Until then I'm left in the flames."
373,my life has been on a decline and i dont see it going up anytime in the future,"for the past 5 years i have not had anything memorable happen let alone enjoyable, im failing in college although im not dumb i just dont see the point in studying 9 different subjects while i want to learn one, which has me stuck in an endless loop of sadness, i think about giving up daily while in the shower, eating playing and every night when i go to bed i think about ending it and i smile while i know it is not the right thing to do i dont see the point anymore, i cant keep lying to myself saying it will all work out while it just isnt nothing is working out and nothing will and its no ones fault but  mine. the only thing that makes me stay neutral is not leaving my room if i leave for an hour when i come back i just remember how bad everything is and how shit life is. and i cant just stay in my room and not leave if i could i honestly think i might enjoy life if i can be safe not leaving my room. i think i lost my point writing this. fuck"
374,I should have killed myself 8 years ago.,"When I was 22, I started seeing a woman I really liked and she left me for someone else. I’m 30 now and have spent the last 8 years trying to recover but regardless of how hard I’ve worked, my life has gone to shit anyway.

- My dad got cancer when I was 23
- He died 4 days after my 24th birthday
- We found out my dads older brother, my uncle who we were very close with, had stolen my dads identity and was lying to us for years about it.
- When I was 25, my mom sued my uncle and after 2 painful years and my family being completely ripped apart, they finally settled.
- When I was 26, right after the settlement, I finished graduate school and that January my mom got breast cancer.

I’ve been running my moms preschool ever since and I absolutely hate it. The stress is overwhelming, I have no experience or education in this field and I absolutely despise being around children, I never wanted any of my own. Every night I go to sleep I hope I don’t wake up. When I do wake up, I hope that I have a massive heart attack or just get hit by a truck or a bus on my way to work and die instantly. I spent 4 years and almost $40k of my own money on a graduate degree that is now worthless.

Once my mom dies I’ll only have my 2 older brothers, but I honestly don’t care about hurting them and am going to kill myself anyway. They have more or less forced/guilted me into running my mom’s preschool in hopes that it’d be passive income for us down the line but I’m so dead inside that I couldn’t care less. The business even working out. I put myself through grad school while my dad was dying and when I finally graduated and had a chance to really start my life 4 years ago, my mom got sick and I stupidly took over running this school. I wasted the last years of my 20s waiting for permission from my family to move on and now it doesn’t even matter. I did everything I could to improve my situation and I’m making less money and have far lower job satisfaction and prospects for a career now than I did when I was 24. *6 years ago.* 

I won’t check myself into the ER because American healthcare sucks and I can’t afford the medical debt that would come with me being put on suicide watch or getting admitted. But I also won’t kill my self because I won’t hurt my mom like that. I know my brothers do love and care about me by honestly don’t care about hurting them when I’ve been suffering for years while they got to go off and start enjoyable lives with fruitful careers, girlfriends, their own homes. My life is worthless, and once my mom is dead, besides my brothers, no one is gonna give a shit I’m gone anyway."

376,"""I don't understand them and I don't want to. I just hate them.""","Anxiety attacks over hearing your family rip apart people like you downstairs haha 🤙🤙

Why can't i just go back in the closet to everyone and be a good little catholic girl who marries a man and lives in a white picket fence house in Utah, has 12 kids and gives up on her career to be a house slave.

Fuck dude i didnt ask for this, I didn't ask to be made like this, I didn't ask to exist- god damn it. Someone please just put me down like a fucking dog. Please just pink juice me already. I just want out. I'm so tired of this suffering. 

I can't take this anymore. I want to go back to my apartment and hang myself from my fucking balcony and let the birds have at it. It's all I deserve."
377,I'm ending it tonight.,"I have major anxiety and depressioni also deal with anorexia, my boyfriend broke up with me because its ""mentally draining"" him I have to deal with myself and my mind all day every day.

378,I feel like ive ruined everything,"Ive fucked everything up. 
I snapped at someone who actually does truly care for me and ive been nothing but an asshole.
I filed mt taxes with turbotax and they didnt actually file so I have to print and hand mail them. (Paid money for that too!)
I missed that deadline so I'm fucking up my health coverage. I had coverage but i havent seen a doctor bc i get panic attacks making phone calls and work too much.
So now that its too late and im in crisis mode its just too late
i got a merry christmas bill of them hiking my premium up 300 dollars which i cant afford 
i cant get my shit together so everything is collapsing in on itself and the three years ive wasted doing nothing and letting everything and everyone in my life go to heck is now finally catching up to me and I deserve it all for being a procrastinating lazy fuck.

I havent spoken to most of my family or friends and literally my days out are going to the grocery store.

I'd check myself in somewhere but that just means more debt on top of student loans and other shit... I cant get a second job bc i need a car and I cant get a car bc I panic behind the wheel and havent gotten my license.

I dont see away of crawling my way out of here without burdening everyone around me.

380,Still want to die.,"Been suicidal since childhood. Last 8 years have been the worst with the last 3 being the worst of the worst.

Everything has gone wrong. Nothing has gone right. Its shit I cant change and I have had enough of it. 

I genuinely just want it to end. I haven't told my family but I have been thinking of what to do before I go. Regards money, belongings, stuff like that. 

I was considering writing letters but there is just too much to do that for everyone. Even those close. Or who are supposed to be close so I probably wont do that. 

I am most sad about my dog. She is 10 and I have her about 8 years now. Out of everyone she was my best friend and the most loyal. She didnt say anything but she was just there for me. 

I dont want a religious funeral. I wanted to be burned and my ashes and her ashes poured out at a big tree together. But she is not ready to go yet and if I go first my family wont keep her and I don't know where she will go and I can't do that to her or take that risk because she was so good to me. 

She was the only reason I got up because I had to take her out to pee and shit. She would do her smile and twirls in the morning and it didn't make me happy as such but I was happy for her. 

Ive just been thinking how to do it. I was worried about my family and how they will cope but they will just have to deal with it. I can't do it anymore. 

Life is hell."

I don't know how to stand up for myself.  I am a homeless, jobless, penniless, worthless veteran.

I am living in a home provided by Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans.  They are fucking with me.  They have contractors in the house that are doing demolition of drywall that is covered in mold and they did not put a barrier up so I have been breathing this toxic shit for about 3 months.  My last roommate stole hundreds of dollars of stuff from me including my big winter coat and my phone.  My dryer hasn't worked in 2 months, another thing broken by the contractors.

They  cut off power to the fridge and I had to throw away a lot of food that I got from food stamps.  I am almost out for the month.  I cannot afford this.  I've already told my landlord and got silence.  I don't know how to act as if I had a family to defend without getting angry.  

Typing this out makes it feel petty, which is good I guess.

387,What is the most lethal yet painless way,"After a year and a half of a losing an uphill battle, I've made the decision on not making it last longer. I don't really understand myself the point of writing this out when nothing matters anymore but here I am. I have no real reason to be depressed except for anything I've brought upon myself, I live a life any human being who's not a weakling would call decent or average at the worst. I've been cursed with being short, puny, not attractive, incredibly socially inept, and worse of all just plain dumb. It's honestly the lack of intelligence that hits home the worse, I come from a house that both despises people who are dumb or lack common sense like myself and also have the attitude where men have to be MEN so I'd never bring any of this up to family for fear of ridicule and ruining my image even more to their eyes. Professional care is too expensive nor would I care to try it even if I could afford it, it's just a hoax for someone with a ""professional understanding"" to let words fall on deaf ears and give big pharma more cash. I won't ever be successful, whereas some people can overcome said obstacles with pure drive I also have none. I learn everything I try slowly and even then only develop a sub par level of skill involving it. No brains, no looks, no drive, no positive physical traits, and at this point no desire to try and alter any of the above because I've realized it's futile. Natural selection is definitely real, it just manifests in different ways now that society has for the most part eliminated it. Luckily with the wonders of the internet I have a shotgun arriving in 5 days to be signed for set a 11 am when everyone will be busy or at work. The only thing I'm scared of is not having near immediate death and having to suffer for an extended period of time, though an hour of dying in physical pain is better than a lifetime of mental pain. If there is someone knowledgeable on the matter, please help a desperate soul in their feeble requests, the end result will be the same but if you can help someone do it painlessly or less so, please do."
388,idk at all,"I don't got anything to whine about... I have good parents and all. But I feel like I'm nobody's favorite person or something close to that. I have some friends but i can't really have good conversations with them. I am not good with women which makes me very sad because in my head I feel like I know what to do but I cannot make it happen. Nobody ever loved me. I feel tired, everyday. Those days are just empy, there's no happiness or something. I don't want to die because I feel like I'm going to miss a lot of good shit than but It's just too much for me to continue crawling to those fantasies. I feel like I need to die soon so all the worries and shit are gone. Thanks for reading"
389,I disappoint everyone...,"
I go to a prestigious school but can't get my homeworks done so I get detention a lot and I might not be readmitted.Its got to the point where I check my homework at the principal's office.When I see my parents they just sigh at me.On the car at the way home they only talk about how I disappoint them.I never succseed to do anything.When I try to do anything,they talk about how my grades are absolutely horrible and tell me to focus on my studies.I try my best but I always fail.If I died,it would have probably made no impact.Should I just be gone?"

I tied a rope, put it around my neck, and leaned towards the edge slowly but didn't let myself go fully off. I ended up untying myself for some reason. I was happy for a while but today I had a disturbingly vivid dream of me on my 20th birthday finally doing it. I had a gun to my head but rather than pulling I trigger, I took a bunch of pills and hung myself and it's been weighing on me. I don't know what to do with myself."

394,Hi I think I’m going to kill my self just before next year starts.,
395,I tried drowning myself in the bath.,"The first week of November, probably the fifth, I was in the bath and I was holding a razor blade for sometime and I kept dropping it on the floor every time someone knocked on the door and eventually I tried just staying underwater staring at the ceiling. I was very close to drowning until a there was a bang on the door and my cousin said “ Are you pulling a hannah baker in there?” I got up and out and got dressed and just sat outside for a few hours, doing nothing. I don’t know what to do anymore. I haven’t told anyone. I don’t think anyone will care because I didn’t do anything to cause long term damage and it wasn’t a very good method. They’ll think I’m just being dramatic."
396,The Feeling of Disassociation,"Im a mid 20s American Male. Im a veteran and I am divorced. I have not been able to hold down a job for 2 years. I have not been able to find motivation since my wife fucked one of my best friends. 

I have been broke. I have gone from my own home to my old bedroom in my parents house. From a man with responsibilities and goals to a man with only his thoughts to dissect 24/7. My GI bill was supposed to take care of me financially until I began hearing voices telling me horrid things constantly. Until my brain interjected my rational stream of thoughts with visions of my suicide. Ive failed every class, i couldn't even attend anymore. 6 years of mental anguish building and growing more mold every year. I can feel what will become of my life. 

Death two months ago seemed drastic but necessary. Now death seems peaceful and inevitable. I cannot do anything about my actions and i don't care about the consequences. I could have had a normal life, unfortunately this life is destined for death. The only question is do I take anybody with me. 

Ive been to the doctor and therapist during spurts of clear headedness. These come less and less often. It makes me cry to see myself go from the most optimistic person ive ever met (seriously, full of life and motivation)  to having no hope. I'm no longer attached to my body, I'm a 3rd person observer. It's sad what's happening to me. I never deserved this treatment, it was just chance that I would marry into evil. Evil people exist and they ruin genuinely good people. Evil will win again, as usual."
397,Is it normal to cry for 6 hours?,"So, this is my first post, I'm nervous. So, my usual night routine is laying down and staring at our ceiling for hours. I can't sleep, I try to close my eyes and sleep but it doesn't really help coz my overthinking is just getting worse. I've been crying for 6 hours for no fricking reason, nope, I think maybe because I'm always not enough and not needed, feels like nothing wouldn't even change if I suddenly disappear one day. So, I just wanted to ask, is what I'm feeling depression or anxiety? I've been like this for 3 years, it just got worse this September. It's like everyday I feel empty, I don't think it's that criticial but yes, I've done self-harm plenty of times. Suicide is also on my to-do-list, but I'm not really certain if what I'm feeling is depression, coz I can still laugh it out and no one could have noticed that I'm hurting myself or maybe I'm just good at pretending? I'm thinking if it's just temporary or nah? Coz its been almost 4 months. Should I ask for help?"

399,:/,"I don’t like to say I’m suicidal or anything because I know there are people in worse situations but tbh I don’t know what to think of myself anymore. Past few years has been nothing but the same shit, school, eat and repeat. Going to school is mind draining and I feel like a bother to my friends at times. 
It’s just a continue cycle of waking up dreading the next day over and over. I sometimes wish I could just hang myself but I know if I do that, my
Family would be heartbroken. Idk what the fuck to do..."
400,Why,"Why am i here

Why am i still alive

Why do i have to act

Why does nobody see me struggling

Why does people think im fakeing

Why do people laugh at me

WHY"
401,I can't enjoy life anymore,"First, excuse me for my shit English because it's not my first language.
For the past few months, my life has been horrible. I won't get into any details but I'll just say that I've been betrayed by people so many times that I lost all my faith in humanity. I also have to deal with emotional abuse since childhood and that just makes everything worse. I have very bad grades and I'm failing math class which is the result of my bad mental state. I don't know if the problem is in others or the problem is just in me. Maybe I truly am a poor excuse of a human being and my personality is off putting or am I just too naive and have high expectations of other people? I guess it doesn't matter anymore because I don't feel sad or anything like that, in fact, I feel nothing at all. The things that used to excite me don't excite me anymore and I feel like there is some kind of a black cloud floating over me and it won't go away. So last few days I feel like taking my own life because its just too tiring and when I think about it, it has no meaning at all. I've actually planned everything but I'm having some second thoughts about it but I think that in the end I'll have to do it because I just can't live with this emptiness anymore. Idk if any of this makes sense or I just sound stupid but if someone has some sort of advice what to do now, please tell me because I'm tired of hearing shit like ""this is just a phase and it'll go away"" bc I know it won't."
402,I feel like a coward. If I had the guts I’d have gone ages ago. But I don’t. And I carry on going through this pain. I guess I’m too scared. And this is why I’m left like this.,
403,I need some help or at least some explanation,Everything is going fine for me I guess. I have really good grades. I have loving parents. My parents fucked me up in my childhood though. I casually think of suicide a lot again. I do feel really depressed and I’m taking antidepressants and I’m in therapy. I’m more just tired of life I guess. Indifference towards everything now.
404,"If hanging out with friends makes me feel worse, should I cut myself off from them?","I noticed the other day that I feel worse when I hang out with certain friends. And if I try to talk to them about feeling lousy they get frustrated and annoyed, or keep saying the same things they always do (like broken records) things they know don’t help. They also tend to invalidate my feelings by saying other people have it worse or talking about coping skills that work for them but I have clearly stated do not work for me. At what point should I stop trying? Is it better to be alone in this case?"
405,It’s all about Death,"Nothing else matters

Always repeat that"
406,I thought I was going to “grow out” of suicidal thoughts,"But I’m not. 

I’m 26 now, and even though there are things I really like about life, I’m sitting here at the job I hate, and I can’t help it. I have a plan, I l know how I could leave, and I can’t help wanting to. 

I want to. 

Why shouldn’t I?"
407,Life is pointless. I‘ve lost all the motivation I’ve ever had.,"I’m in my final year of high school. I failed most of my IG exams, will most likely fail my AS exams and I know for a fact no university will accept me. I have thrown my future away is what I’m constantly told. What future? Any direction I go I will be fucked. Find a job? I’ll fall into the pit of relentless 9-5 and boredom. Don’t find a job? I’ll be outcasted by my family. I want nothing more than to die. Everything is pain and struggle and all for what? I’ll just die in the end and no matter how great of a thing I accomplish my name will be forgotten. I don’t want to work, I don’t want to study, I don’t even want to enjoy my hobbies. I just want to decay. Constantly being told I’m sick is starting to piss me off as well. It’s like people are too fucking stupid to look around them and realize the state of the world. It’s not like there’s some bullshit chemical imbalance in my brain. Life is shit and the morons who think I’m sick need to get that through their pathetic peanut brains. I will kill myself in the coming months."
408,"nothing is right in my life, feels pointless to keep on","warning: huge paragraphs of me venting that I should probably tell a therapist instead of posting here, but whatever 

I have crippling social anxiety, so I have no friends. nobody to talk to. I recently moved away to attend a university that’s away from home, and I’ve had zero luck socializing. I found that I can never get too close to someone without losing them. never been in a relationship either. the farthest I’ve went was 3 dates, but I’m not even sure if you could consider those dates or just hanging out. from this, I assume that I’m either very uninteresting or just toxic, so people tend not to stick around. I signed up for a student organization next semester, so I’m hoping I’ll have a better shot at socializing then.

I entered college with high hopes that i was going to excel academically like I did in high school. even though my college is fairly competitive and I likewise chose a competitive major, I ended my first semester with a 2.955 GPA. considering i put my outmost effort into keeping my grades up, I feel like a dumbass for having achieved so low. I have no clue how I’m going to bring my cumulative up and get accepted into grad school and I am debating just dropping out.

I’m home now for winter break. I have no job right now. I did have a job over the summer, and I recently contacted them twice just to see if there were any open positions that I could work over my break. no response. I’m one of those people who feel guilty and anxious when they’re unproductive, so ofc this makes me feel lazy and shitty. I did get a gym membership over break and I’ve been going, so I’m somewhat proud of myself for that.

but here’s the worst problem for me right now. I’m very insecure about my physical appearance. I have a big nose and bad skin. I can’t stand to look at the lower half of my face. I have a very prominent chin and jawline for a woman. I was born with an underbite and plenty of other dental problems. so here I am, a college student with braces and a bunch of other metal devices on my teeth that result in a very unsettling looking smile. I constantly get passive aggressive comments related to my braces. some examples including asking when I’m going to get them off, being shocked that I’ve still had them for 3+ years, suggesting for me to clean my teeth better when I already clean them constantly, or just straight up telling me to close my mouth when smiling in photos.

I understand that life is not all about looks, but being constantly reminded by society that my appearance is below average has had a profound influence on my mental health. I want to look in the mirror and not see a monster. and because of this, I’m debating asking my orthodontist to take my braces off early, but I don’t want to waste money. I still don’t know when I’m supposed to be getting them off though, and I don’t want to endure what could possibly be more years of psychological torture.

to sum this all up, I find that I am worthless in virtually every category that can be defined by worth. I’m socially awkward. I’m not smart, nor successful. I’m ugly. nothing excites me because my insecurities define me. I feel as if I’m subhuman. I’m finding that my motivation to push through life is declining. I don’t want my suffering to get worse. I just want it to come to a halt. I’m not strong enough to imagine the future."
409,My best friends just admitted they don't care about me,One of them even called me a nuisance. They were my only irl friends and now I'm alone.
410,Posting here to get it off my chest,"I know my user seems misleading for posting here but I wish I could go back in time (when I was 15 I OD but told my mother because I had a dream about being reborn ) I’m 23 now and currently I feel like everyone would have been better off if I died  I try to improve myself and I have though after my experiences this year.. let’s just say I’ve heard voices in my head a guy I dated that kinda ended up being culty (I moved all the way to Wyoming to keep him from being homeless and pretty much stopped talking while we lived in the car together for 2 1/2 months  I left most of my belongings in his car so we could sleep laying down cause his back hurts (he was 40 and waiting on a disability court hearing ) anywho at some point he told me there’s evil in my heart and now I can just be thinking to myself and I’ll get “there’s evil in your heart” oh and he says he’s God now sooo 🤷🏻‍♀️then I talked to this guy I’ll call him B anyways B has troubles lost someone he had been with for a very long time  we started talkin Because at this point I still just wanted to help the world  I wanted to make a little hippie community or something where people could live fulfilling lives... anyways part of his issues diagnosed with schizophrenia he had a had some visions of a potential future figured he was gonna die soon and also worried he was being gang stalked. He cursed me out called me evil  told me I had no talent  after I had let him in and wanted to move  there  he apologized a few weeks later  then he did it again  I didn’t clean up my paint for a month or two it was on the floor I stepped on it left paint didn’t care  
I feel like my own minds attacking me  I wish I was dead because if I’m dead I don’t have to hear any of it if I’m dead I’m gone and if I’m gone why do I care also have a bf hasn’t talked to me much  found out my ex still has feeling  has a gf too thinks about me while with said gf 

I really wish I died a long time ago I don’t feel like the life I’m living is worth the dumb evil Wanna be good hearted person I wish I was my residents tell me I’m nice and sweet and that they love me but my mind calls me evil sometimes I wonder if they can feel that I need that"
411,I'm just a burden and no one will miss me,"I want to die but I'm too scared. I'm scared I'll regret it in my last few moments, I'm scared that I may someday be a better person that improves people's lives instead of just hurting people and being a bummer. I've been searching for the last 30 minutes how to kill myself and now I can't stop sobbing. My sister's won't talk to me and I don't deserve my friends or my boyfriend. I have nothing to offer the world and my anxiety, PTSD and depression is too hard to live with. I think I may actually end it."
412,There’s a shooting threat for tomorrow and I hope it happens so that someone also can do what I’m to afraid to,Like 2 weeks ago at my school there was a shooting threat discovered in the bathroom that was left before thanksgiving break and honestly I hope that someone will do it just kill me and no one else I don’t want anyone else hurt it’s just that I hope this guy blows me away
413,What's the point of living?,"My life is not (that) fucked up, yet I still wonder what's the point of all. I left a job where I pretty much barely had to do anything for more interesting career opportunities, and after going through a couple jobs I realized that I hate working. Unfortunately I either have to work or starve. Even while working my ass off, I can't afford to buy a house or a decent car. I'm pretty much slaving away to put food on the table and put some money away for savings. We would have to save for 10 years just to afford a down payment, if our rent stays the same (which it won't)

I have a wife and a kid. I find no joy in either of them. My kid is 1 year old, and the only thing I feel towards it is annoyance when I have to take care of it. No feelings of joy at all, and I'm always trying to squirm out of any fatherly duties. This obviously pisses my wife off. BTW, regarding my wife, the spark is not there at all now (maybe it never was) We pretty much just stuck together and things evolved. Somehow she forgot to dump me? Sex is not great, though I haven't had any for 1.5 years now. She's not interested in any of my fetishes and said to me a couple of times that she doesn't find me attractive anymore (I did gain about 20 pounds in the past 15 years...) I can't rely on her for emotional support (or anyone, but I've learned to deal with shit on my own), we can't talk about our issues (everything is my fault, and I just apologize and give up, instead of having another argument) I often feel emotionally neglected, there's barely any physical contact. 

I don't have close friends. There's a couple of mates I talk to semi-regularly, but that's all. All my relationships are superficial. Also, I can't afford mental health (without being locked up), so I have to deal with my problems on my own. At least I'm not addicted to anything apart from cigarettes, though I considered drinking myself into oblivion every night. Realized I don't even like the taste of liquor, so I can't even be a proper drunkard. 

I don't necessarily want to die, but I don't see the point of being a small cog in the machine, slaving away for 40-50 years and achieving nothing, apart from a dysfunctional family (pretty sure that my kid is going to be fucked up) Every day after some mind numbing work I'm pretending to like my kid, supporting a woman whom I don't feel anything toward, then browsing reddit or memes until I go to sleep. I don't game or work out anymore, I don't have any social life. I'm also ugly and have some health issues. When going to sleep I'm hoping that I won't wake up. Not sure if I'll ever have the strength to off myself, high chances that I'll suffer though life and die a painful death as a miserable cancer-ridden shell of a man (yay, genetic disposition). For the past two years, all my decisions lead to a shittier quality of life (not financially, but mentally), so not sure if I can improve upon my situation. I could divorce, but it would just lead to having to pay child support and regretting the choice until the rest of my (what if I could've had a good relationship with my kid when it's older, etc) Also, I would be even more alone, as pretty much nobody would like to be a relationship with me (poor, ugly, geek, weird kinks) I see no way out :/"
414,I'm completely exhausted from life now.,"My mother is devoid of empathy. She told me today that 'having me around makes life unbearable'. The way she said it was so flat, like she didn't even feel what she was saying, not understanding how saying something like that would affect a person mentally. She spouts things like this to me everyday. I feel completely dehumanised and disrespected daily.

 My father completely enables her behaviour because he's essentially her bitch (if I may). She has completely mentally abused him to the point where he is mentally weak and has retired. He is now also a hypochondriac. 

She prays on our weaknesses like a drug, and abuses people who show any vulnerability whatsoever. Constantly reminding him that he is not a man, she is stronger than him, etc. She won't even make her own cup of coffee, he has to make it for her everytime, like a slave. 

I now have come to the conclusion that with an abusive and toxic mother and an enabler father, i will never be in a position where I'll ever be allowed to live the way I choose, and ill never be allowed to be happy. I honestly believe the safest way out is by ending it now, at 24F before there are any chances for me to have children to bring into this disaster dynamic. 

I cry everytime I see happy families on tv, and have had a consistent jealousy for people that have lived a normal life, even now becoming hostile with other women because of how I've been treated by my mother, I can't form healthy female relationships. 

I don't think I'll ever be able to heal from this situation, im completely damaged from the life I've lived. My trust issues are irreparable, im completely paranoid and afraid of the world. 

If I could start all over again I wouldn't, not in this body, not as me. 

As far as im concerned I was never suppossed to be born in the first place. The emotional turmoil I have faced feels worse than any death, or other tragedies I've ever faced. 

I wish my mother would have gotten help for her mental illnesses. She's never once taken responsibility or apologised for anything she has ever said or done. Her mother and father did the same to her, and abused me in my early years until I chose to cut contact. 

I will carry that to the grave. 

I must not let this cycle continue."
415,Why?,"Why was I born into this world if my parents don’t like me? Why do I have to go to school if I won’t learn anything? Why do I have to put on a fake smile and say I’m okay? Why did my parents sign me up for counseling if they don’t like me? Why didn’t my parents just abort me? Why do I try to make friends if it will never work? Why do I try to be happy if it will never work? Why do I try to talk to someone if I know in the end they aren’t going to remember me in 5 years if I kill myself? Why do I wake up if I only want to cry? Why do I go to school if it makes me hate myself a little bit more? Why do I continue to live if nothing, not love, not happiness, not family, not my future, is left?"
416,Waiting for an opportunity,Whenever my parents leave me alone at home im just gonna hang myself if im not too scared to do it
418,Sad Soul,"I’m scared. I know I shouldn’t do it, but I know I’ll feel so much better. I feel so guilty for doing this to the people that care. But I really hope someday they understand. And not because they ever feel this way. I don’t want them to think I’m selfish, because for once, I am putting myself first. I can’t stand the constant lows. I’m sick of crying every minute I’m alone. I’m sick of spending every dime on alcohol, just to finally feel something. 
Not everything gets better. When your life is in a constant decline, I can’t even stand to hear that anymore. My only regret is I should have done this sooner. People would be over it by now, and I would have known less people to disappoint. 
I’m not posting this to be talked out of it. My mind has been set for quite a while. I’m posting this because I’m hopping someone will read it and think about their sad friend. Or sibling. or anyone in general. Reach out to them. Tell them you love them, even if you can’t change their mind. 
I’ve dedicated the last week to seeing friends I haven’t hung out with because of my issues. Checked up on the friends that moved away. Done my share of good deeds for strangers. Made someone smile. I guess this is it. 
My inbox will be open to anyone struggling, until later tonight. I won’t tell you it’ll get better, but I can listen.

419,Help please,So i just got out of a 5 h fight with my dad and I'm having a mental breakdown and I think I might hurt myself please if anyone can help
420,I am so close to doing it,"Everything just falls apart. Ex cheated on me 4 years ago, been single since until August. Now that relationship also fucked up because of me being jealous piece of shit. I just can't take this anymore. I keep repeating my mistakes and always fuck everything up and don't have anyone who cares about me."
421,The only thing keeping me from ending it all right now is that I don’t want to die alone,"I don’t want to go into the details, I’ve just struggled for so long. Been through things that would make your eyes water. Half of the people I grew up with are gone because they couldn’t cope with living with what they experienced. 
I’ve toes the line so many times, but tonight I finally realized, I’m scared to die alone. 
I’ve never felt real love. I have a terrifying fear of abandonment because that’s all I’ve ever known, and the idea of ending my life with that feeling in sharp focus is terrifying. 
But I can’t keep going. I can’t do this. 
Everything I touch turns to shit because my mind is so broken. I have borderline personality disorder. I am toxic as fuck and I try so hard to not be, but it’s so overwhelming. I cannot see a future where I don’t break everything I love. 

Not even my daughter is a convincing enough argument for me anymore. I just wanna stop being here. I have nothing. She’s better off without me, objectively. All I do is end up hurting her because I can’t cope. 
But I’m scared of leaving feeling this alone."
422,I’ve done bad things. I’m a bad person,"The things I’ve done would make anyone with a conscious call me a sociopath. I’ve done bad things to people who have considered themselves my family. I’ve done bad things to vulnerable people.  The worst part is I don’t regret any of it. I would do those things again. 

People like me deserve to die to stop hurting others."
423,"On May 5th the last day of school I decided I wouldn’t take my mother’s blood pressure pills I stole cause I wanted to wait for the next School Year, to see if something will change and someone in the world would love me. Nothing has changed, it’s all the same. I will kill myself Saturday Morning",
424,Would it be rude to kill myself before attending a concert where I promised my favorite band gifts?,"Hi again. I don't think I mentioned this in my last post, but this coming January, I'm going to a concert to see my favorite band open for a really popular musician. I'm actually getting into the show for free, because I drew the lead singer and she asked for it on a shirt, with free entry to the show in return. 

The band members are really nice and I've spoken to all of them before, so I decided to get all of them gifts, I've even ordered the bassist's gift already and it's supposed to arrive soon. But I don't know if I can make it to January. 

Would it be rude if I killed myself and was therefore unable to go to the show and give the band the gifts I promised them?"
425,I almost did it,"I haven’t been right lately. I know I haven’t. It’s been so bad, that I can’t even explain how bad it is. Just terrible. I’ve been thinking about killing myself so much, I fantasize about it. I had been begging for a gun from someone for a while. Kept pestering him. I offered him a LOT of money. Everything I had. I was going to go to the bank and empty my accounts right then. I finally got the answer I had wanted, and I felt this surge of happiness I hadn’t felt. It was scary though. It was like I was happy to have the opportunity to kill myself with a gun, with slim to none chances of survival. I was happy this was it, that I would be gone. I had gone months wanting this, craving this, and finally getting it. That surge of happiness scared the shit out of me because I had never felt anything like that. I was almost giddy. When it came to it, and he asked for the money, I chickened out. I thought about a failed suicide, and what would actually happen if I got a gun. Would I freeze up and have wasted all my earnings for nothing? Would I miraculously survive? I ended up saying no. I chickened out. And yes I’m angry at myself for not doing it. I’m so angry. It feels like a missed opportunity. I feel like I passed something up I won’t get again. Today, I feel like I died last night. I don’t feel right because of how close I got. I feel emptiness, nothing. Just regret. I cried though. I haven’t been able to cry, the tears just don’t come. I did cry yesterday. I cried for myself. How could I be so, so hurt that I wanted to put a bullet through my head? All I have to say is today I feel a lot of regret. I feel weak, stupid, a chicken, and a failure."
426,flashbacks and bad memories,how to cope with these rn please i am struggling
427,I would have killed myself yesterday if I was at home,"I know this for a fact. I was so broken up over the one month anniversary of him taking his own life, and I know for a fact that I would have killed myself if I were at home.


At home, I have a stash of 79 pills in a little black box. There's not a doubt in my mind that I would have swallowed them all had I not been staying at my dad's place for a while.


I'm just thinking... it sounds so fucked up that I know for a fact I would have committed suicide if not for the simple fact that I don't have access to those pills currently. 


I'm feeling so many emotions over that right now. The prevalent one is regret that I hadn't done it. Even today, I keep thinking about how great it would be to end it all.


I guess I can attribute the fact that I'm still alive to luck, luck that made it so I wasn't at home.


I hate being this 'lucky'."

429,I Just Wanna Die,"I've been better for a long time but it all went down in just a week. I sleep all day and cry all night, and basically just wanna fall asleep and never wake up again."
430,"I don't want to die, but I don't want to live","I've been coping with trauma (from years of neglect from both of my parents and abuse from both of their spouses and others) nearly my entire existence. 

Living is heavy. I have felt like I'm carrying so much weight for years and years and its presenting such a unique, nagging pain in my head or my shoulders. I'm tired of the constant lump in my throat like you get when you're trying to hold back tears. Recently the years of not being able to sleep have also been catching up with me. 

Nobody sees my pain and when I try to tell people like my family I am not taken seriously. Neither of my parents accept the fact that they ever did anything wrong. I told my brother and he said ""You seem fine to me"" and when I told my grandma she laughed and said that of all the people she thought more than anyone else that I'd be able to get over it and not hold grudges. She said I have a chip on my shoulder and I need to forgive and forget, which I have tried for 15 years in vain. The chip never goes away. 

I know, people have it worse and whatever, I've heard it and I'm tired. It reaches beyond myself, even. The world sucks. I can't change myself. I can't change the world. I can't change anything except how much longer I have to be here. 

I have two people in the world to live for and my mental state affects both of them negatively. I love them both and they are all I have. I am coming to the end of my rope. How do I convince myself that they need me when I can't be good for them? How on earth do I convince myself that living is really the better option?"
431,Every waking minute,"I just can’t. I just can’t. I feel nothing about anything or anyone. I can’t live anymore. I can’t wait. The paperwork I am waiting for before I go. I can’t wait for it anymore. I feel no guilt, no regret, nothing. I need to go."
432,I’m not sure what to do anymore,"I’m pretty sure I fucked up again. Actually, I know I did. I got two friends back and I tucked it up again. I was closer with one than the other. I could tell her so many things and she got it. She knew what it was like but then I was stupid and people found out things and then they all came together and I’m pushed out again and I shouldn’t be hurt by it because it already happened but it’s happening again and I’m so lost and I don’t know how to stop. I didn’t mean to tell anyone. I mean I did but they all live in different states. I thought I put it in a different chat that she wasn’t in but she was fucking there and I hate myself for it. I’m ruining people. I ruin people and friendships. I don’t know how I have any friends. I’m awful. If someone tells me something I’m usually good at not telling people but I couldn’t not tell someone. I didn’t know what to do and I messed up so bad and I tried to say sorry and I did and she still left. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do."
433,I hate my face and want to kill myself.,"I’m extremely unattractive, there’s no sugar coating it. The only people that say I look “handsome” is my mom, my one and only friend, and old ladies in public. (That’s when you know you’re truly ugly).  I wasn’t always ugly though as a kid I had god features. My face was symmetrical and everything. However over the years my face started to get worse. Usually with age and puberty people get more attractive. That wasn’t the case for me. 

So to start here’s what’s unattractive about me:
•My jaw and chin are EXTREMELY uneven (this is perhaps the biggest contributing factor to my hideousness as facial symmetry is the MOST important key factor when it comes to deeming someone attractive or not, when you look at me dead on i look completely disfigured

•My cheek bones are uneven, one is bigger than the other and protrudes farther out. Once again the asymmetry makes me uglier than I would be if my features were symmetrical. 

•My nose is uneven as well (Lookie here see any patterns? More asymmetry the perfect recipe for being UGLY) I have a deviated septum which pushes on of my nostrils making it bigger than the other. 

•My lips are flat (this is just unexplainable, I’m black and have flat ugly lips something my RACE IS KNOWN FOR and I didn’t get it great) 

•My forehead is huge and takes up half my face and has those ugly forehead lines

•I have a dent in my head from being hit in the head by a heavy metal object at Walmart (this only helps to make me look more disfigured and deformed and it’s irreversible and can’t be fixed by plastic surgery) I usually wear a Durag or bonnet to cover it up as I’ll just look to gross without it 

•My neck is abnormally long
•My face is round and not long and square like most attractive peoples

In public people look at me in disgust, whenever I’m talking people don’t look me in my eyes because of how ugly I am, I’m treated like trash compared to more attractive people. I was even told once before by an old man that I NEEDED plastic surgery because I was so ugly. I’m a virgin and never have had a boyfriend. 

Looks are THE MOST important thing in our society and while you don’t have to be drop dead gorgeous to reap the benefits of being conventionally attractive, if you’re disfigured like me life is a living hell. I tried to tough it out and think maybe looks aren’t as important as I thought but that’s a lie they are. 

Attractive people are desired more which boosts their self confidence. They get free things. They get better opportunities. They have more friends. I personally don’t care for all the other stuff I just want to look good for myself but I’m so ugly it’s unbearable to look at myself in the mirror. 

When I started noticing my horrendous flaws and disfigurements I vowed that I’d go to school and eventually make tons of money to be able to afford plastic surgery but it feels like I’ll never be able to raise enough money in time to be able to fix all these things in time before my youth runs out. 

My jaw has always been a problem for me but it was tolerable. But the dent in my head which is sooo noticeable I’m just unable to live with it. In a world where everyone is either extremely attractive or they’re average but have good facial symmetry I just don’t fit in. 

Whenever I see pics of myself I just want to die right then and there. It sucks our world only cares about looks I wish they weren’t a thing or I was attractive enough to be able to enjoy my life. But I don’t. I don’t really care for life like that if I’m not attractive because pretty much everything boils back down to how good you look."
434,Told myself I’d kill myself before I’d go homeless for a fourth time.,"That’s two weeks from happening. It doesn’t look avoidable, so at this point, I’m looking up quick and painless ways to get it done. I can’t wait to not have to deal with being crushed under the weight of this filthy fucking world."
435,I want to say goodbye,"I want to tell everyone goodbye. I don't want ""help"". I just want to say goodbye, but I'm afraid someone will intervene, that's why I'm staying silent."
436,"Back again. Made a mistake when 13, my cousin may be trying to sue me. I'm done with everything.","I'm back again, and I'm sorry for being here...

I posted before about how I was going to end my life over a situation from when I was about 13 years old which you can read in my post history if you need.

The situation has escalated quite a bit.

My cousin has been sending out even stranger text messages, this time yesterday telling my brother, ""I don't want you in my life anymore, or to talk to you anymore.""

Today, when he and I were texting back and forth he asked me if I was feeling better at all. I told him a little, and he sent another weird message: 

&gt; ""Sorry, my attorney has all the papers he needs. Sorry if I'm a bit distracted. Love you!""

Now, he has an attorney for social security disability, but now my mind is going out of control wondering if he's going to attempt to sue me now.

I literally have nothing. I have a broken back, no ability to get anywhere, live in an abusive environment. 

I can't think of any other way this can go but ending my own life."
437,The thoughts just won't leave me alone,"I'm sick of school. I'm sick of worrying about college and working after it. I'm sick of having to deal with my eating disorder that leaves me physically exhausted and overly emotional. I'm sick of not being able to get help for my depression and eating disorder. I'm sick of the people around me judging me 24/7. I'm sick of stupid winter and seasonal depression and possibly getting the flu. I want to be happy, healthy and alive, but it just seems hopeless and I can't stop thinking about suicide."
438,I don't think I'm still alive for the next year,"Well i'm done, i'm so tired and i don't want to live anymore. There is nothing left to do, no reason to live. I have been thinking about how, cutting my veins or taking a lot of pills. All because my boyfriend cheated on me, i have failed in college, my friends believe that i am an obstacle and that they do not want to listen to me anymore, I dont want to cause my parents any more problems, then this is the only solution that i have left. People say ""be strong"" ""try hard"", it doesnt work like that, they dont know what ive been through, how many nights ive been crying, how many stabs in the back i received, so they get sick of me.

Good news! I killed myself! i won't bother anyone else anymore. My ex-boyfriend, who promised me eternal love (bullshit, i dont believe in love anymore) wouldnt give a shit my death, i had to work hard and save money to live with him, even money from my food. It get worse when i stopped eatting to be more ""pretty"". it's not the first time, it would be the sixth failed romance. Now all i want is a few seconds of peace with myself, leaving this world, i don't care if i go to hell or heaven, if my soul ceases to exist, i don't know. don't cry and don't go to my funeral"
439,I'm mentally checked out and want to die even if things get better,I am just so drained and want this to be over with.
440,I don't know if I would call it an attempt or not,"Last weekend I did tie a rope around my neck and kinda lowered myself over the edge but I couldn't quite let myself fully drop. I got up and untied myself, went home and put the rope away. I went to bed. I don't know what that was really. I still really feel like I want it all to end."
441,I want peace,I guess everything is kinda meaningless. My boyfriend and I argued about some weird shit that should be completely unimportant but that still means something to me and im hurt and he just said goodnight and left me alone and idk what to do. And I just wanna cut my arms open I want it to bleed I want it really badly I want it to hurt and to end slowly. I just want everything to be over and to stop feeling.
442,Do I say goodbye?,"I have been debating if I should write letters to people who matter. I really don't want to live anymore. I'm tired and life just keeps coming at me. 
If I do write letters, they'd be given to those people obviously after I'm gone. I feel like there would be less guilt for people. If that makes sense. 
I'm just looking for another point of view."
443,30yo. Been sufering for at least 15 years because of my appearence and how people stay away from me because of it,"Been contemplating suicide for the last year as I got out of copes...

I see all my friends getting into relationships, marrying, having children making new friends easily, no one talkes to me at work. While I never had anything, absolutely 0.

I can send you pics, by private message..."
444,This country want me to die,No insurance they won’t approve my applixatoon I’m in so much pain I’m getting serotonin syndrome being off my meds
445,I’m still a teenager in high school but I just don’t see the point in living anymore,"All I do is have the same repetitive days and it seems like nothing gives me happiness anymore no matter how hard I try. My school keeps fucking me over and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m lost in a hopeless pain that I can’t escape and all I feel is anger and sadness, I can’t look forward to anything because it just feels like it’s going to end in misery , I don’t really have any *actual* friends and I know there’s a future for me somewhere. I just don’t feel like it’s worth the pain anymore, it’s unbearable to live with, I know there are people out there who have it so much worse than me and all that makes me think is there’s another reason to kill myself. I constantly see myself after the fact and realize how I should’ve handled things or what I should’ve said, maybe sometimes people just aren’t built to live here."
446,I screwed up my life beyond conception,"I’m trying to plan my suicide but every plan is eventually foiled. There’s no way to commit suicide with 100% success. I don’t have access to a gun or dangerous drugs. I only have Tylenol /aspirin/Benadryl, a belt and a very dull knife. I set my date but I just need the execution. I know suicide methods aren’t supposed to be discussed here but I’m already dead inside and now my body needs to go too. Please help!"
447,I just want to...,"Walk in the woods and let myself freeze to death. Life is miserable. It will always be miserable. save the bs that it gets better for someone else, it doesn’t. Real life is unfair. Some people literally have miserable life’s then die, nothing good happens to them. It’s just a struggle till you.

A struggle till you die. Everyday. 

I’m going to go cut myself ASAP because that’s all I’ve got."
448,Can’t cope,"I really can’t. I know no one cares. I know it doesn’t matter. I don’t want to die, even though I think I should. I really don’t. But I can’t make anyone understand. I can’t keep pushing. My migraines aren’t migraines. It’s Trigeminal neuralgia and it’s here every day now for hours or all day. Even without that, I couldn’t. I can’t. I won’t. But I don’t want to. I keep reaching out but it’s the same thing every time. Ignored, not understood, waste of time. I have no answers, no solutions. I can’t go through more decades of this. It’s only getting worse. My heart races so fast and everything feels scary. 

I was never given a chance to be okay, to be normal. Just take it all away, help me make it go away, please"
449,Xanax and alcohol,I only have 7mg of xanax. If I drink a lot of alcohol and add another over counter med in to the mix will I die?
450,..,I didn't want to post here but I'm out of options... basically I want to kill myself but my only option is to OD and I'm ok with that but I'm scared I might mess up... what if I fuck it up and I become a vegetable or somthing like what if I end up hearing and seeing and smelling everything but I just cant move or speak like I'm terrified of the thought but not of dying. I'm ready to die intact the thought of knowing that I'll be dead makes me so happy I dont even question it I just dont wanna mess everything up worse.
451,Millennial monkey,"in 1983 this baby was born and had a really shitty life filled with bullying; intimidation, anger, upsetness, narcissistic parents, abuse, neglect, codependency. He was surrounded by alcohol abuse, unhealthy eating habits, fits of rage, unhealthy tv watching, hording, and cats(that died a lot). He grew up with learning disabilities, teachers that scolded him, friends who betrayed him, got in fights, singled out, ostracized. In his young adult life he was feared by the community that had shunned him once the Columbine shootings happened in 1999 his Freshman year. Through high school he took on few friends, and more learning difficulties, but managed to get a diploma. After high school he was directionless, worked a meaningless job, abused drugs, and stagnated. At 21 he went off to college for a degree he didn't even really want. Then he dropped out after upsetting behavior and several attempts on his life and several visits to psych wards, and further abuse of drugs and alcohol. In 2012 he had some small success in some acting gigs, but ultimately didn't get what he wanted, and eventually stopped trying. Now at 36 he has moved to a place he doesn't want to be, funded by his parents, and after several failed attempts at obtaining employment, or even finding a community/volunteer work to be part of, he will be making another attempt on his life. Hopefully this one will be the final attempt."
452,i dont have a reason to keep going,
453,I just need some reassuring words in here because I will never get any irl,"I (19F) am severely depressed and it has been the same since I was very young (it probably started at the age of 14) to the point where idk what it's like being a non depressed person anymore, I currently live in an Islamic country but everyday I keep losing more and more faith and I keep feeling more and more distanced from everyone else around me...there was a time when I was a top class student and I was very motivated to do something with my life (even though I live in a place where ppl don't really have high expectations for women and we're all expected to make marriage our ultimate life goal) but then suddenly everything just started falling apart and I had a major burn out which made me become extremely unmotivated to do anything and started having a hard time keeping up with my pears and constantly feel left out (I am currently studying to become an architect).
Like I mentioned earlier it is highly expected of me to think of marriage and marriage only (my mother has been trying to look for marriage deals for me since the age of 17) and that is honestly frightening to me, I am so scared of relationships and intimacy, it's paralyzing to me, I feel like not only no one will ever love me for who I am but also I am not enough for someone to live with me till death do us part. And also I feel like I can't really live a happy life if I were to get married especially at a young age, it would be like chaining me and slowly destroying every single piece of my self. But then again, I can't really tell my parents this because after all this is the only thing they're waiting from me and I feel extremely selfish when I think about it because all my life they have been good to me and sometimes I hear my mom saying that she is waiting for marriage day because it will be the only happy day of her life which makes me feel disgusting...so I don't really have a choice to make here tbh.
I constantly feel like I'm slowly dying inside, I have no one to share my feelings with and I probably never will. I have no motivation to do anything in life, I am depressed because I'm failing and I'm failing because I'm depressed. I am 100% convinced that people like me are just not meant to exist in this world and I wish to gather up the courage to disappear before the age of 23. The only thing that is keeping me from doing it now is the fact that my passing away will hurt my family members and to them it will be a shame to have a daughter who killed herself...so I just gotta keep it up for a while at least for them, but tbh I wish I was never born in the 1st place


P.S : I don't have anything against my religion, it is just the way the society I live in functions and sorry if this is badly written or if I did any English mistakes, I hope this message will resonate with someone"
454,Ex [ 23F ] destroyed my life [ 25 M ],"Hello , me and my ex were in a relationship for 1.5 it was really lovely and respectful relationship till she changed in one day with out any specific reason.

I tried to so nc for 1 month and she didn't give a d** about me and was living her life to the fullest, after 1 month i lost it all and started begging to get her back , we have been on this for 1 month till we got back together.

After she took me back , she changed alot with the relationship doesn't answer my phone , doesn't want to meet , only talks to me while she has nothing to do , doesn't listen to me or about my life or plans.

After 2 months of this i told her if she doesn't love me she can leave and I promise her to never come back ( she didn't give an answer ) , we started arguing everyday because of her behavior and she always blame it about my personality while she is really doing things that hurt me .

She started to blame my personality, and once i hear her laughing with her friend about me , I don't know what she was doing all the time she was trying to make me look really bad and a psycho to her friends.

I have lost my dignity myself and even my respect to myself , i know i did it to myself , but i tried to end this relationship alot but when i do so she doesn't leave me alone to heal and I told her million times to leave me alone to heal if she doesn't want me but nothing changed . Unfortunately I became her doormat and im disgusted of myself .

Im an engineer and i have to do masters we both have thhe same major and in the same college, I have only 2 choices to go back and face her and her friends and be in the same college = every second with her and her friends or to lose my future and i know it's the worst thing i could do 

Tl;dr;  i lost my self and became a weak emotional man for my ex and became a joke to all the people who know me , im tired alot and i might lose my future because i can't really handle people joking on me in public , i know im pathetic and anyone reading this would feel disgusted but it happened and im dying everyday because of it , anyhelp would be really appreciated ."
455,Lost someone who meant more to me than anyone could know,"I want to join them up above, nobody understands how I feel, it feels like it’s me against the world,

I’m only 20 years old (male) but it feels like every year has just got worse and worse I’ve lost someone who meant everything to me I’ve got dreams that I can’t achieve I just don’t want to do this anymore.

I haven’t told anybody close to me they wouldn’t get it, everybody already judged as it is

It all comes down to I don’t have the balls to do it, mentally I don’t want to be here anymore but I can’t force myself to do it"
456,I don’t know who to trust anymore,"My parents have been divorced for 9 years. Im fifteen. I have always brought problems from home to my school. I had problems getting friends. I have always had problems with being honest. It all came from home, and from second grade onward, i was taught that my father was the manipulative one. I believed it, and everything i saw supported it. I had planned to finally cut contact with him today.

Then he gives me his side, and it soundes truthful, though he still attacked my mother. I just have no idea who’s lying or who’s telling the truth. Or if both of them are lying. And no matter what, the wreck i am is a product of a nine year long lie. I just can’t take it. I can’t live with this.

Im on my way to my mothers place now, but i swear i can’t live like this till the new year. I can’t take my life."
457,I will never be happy again 💔,"Like i feel like i dont belong and im one of those ppl that just sit in a corner in a fed position like i dont know like how to make friends like i struggle with that and it get worse day by day and that im just very standoffish and awkward that i dont know like how to put myself as a person out there its just that the struggles i had to face in my life like ppl don't understand that i struggle with depression i struggle with anxiety i struggle with fitting in i struggle with having suicidal thoughts i struggle with death of family and use to be friends like they do not know anything about where i had to get through and who i am today its like that the saying goes ""dont judge a book by its cover"" what i mean by that is i wrote a book that say on the cover the girl with a happy life and inside of the book its nothing but sadness and heartache like ppl do not know anything about me like they haven't been in my shoes with a death of a twin sister divorce parents death of family members and me struggling with depression and anxiety and alot of physical health problems like they dont know and for them judging me bc of the stuff that have gone through in life its make me feel sick inside to why ppl stick so low to think that of me and plus im on the autism spectrum and me 17 years misdiagnose all my life and my mom preach to everyone at school teachers family that im on the spectrum and no one believes her and ppl making fun of me when i was little for thinking that i had autism i have no value in this crual world so this is where my journey comes to an end i have no purpose in my life anymore im just a burden to everyone 😔😫😭🥺💔💔"
458,Rejected for food stamps and struggling,"It's so difficult for me to get ahead of my bills, keeping up on student debt payments and having little to nothing left to survive on. Tired of working 70+ hours a week for it amount to nothing when it all goes to bills. What's the point in working this hard if I can't make a foundation for myself? I can't even get the mental health services I need because it all comes down to money. No government programs will support me because they look at my income but don't give a shit about the student debt ruining my life. Things are so bad that I feel like the only way is selling my soul/body to creepy sugar daddies but I'd rather die than allow someone to control my body too. I can't bring myself to rely on some older dude and sexually gratify him. Best option is to leave this world for the pain to end."
459,those who feel comfortable answering...,"those who have attempted, how’d you do it? what was it like? i want to know."
460,My sister makes me suicidal and I can't sever the relationship,"I'm financially dependent on my sister because my mom left everything to her when she died and I'm currently unemployed. She gives me a small stipend every month. I'm struggling to get a job and she doesn't give me enough money to really survive. I'm drowning in debt right now. 

I'm trying to get a job and she makes me feel bad about it and worthless and incompetent. She's really focused on pushing me into a menial, minimum wage position despite me having a college education. It's like she doesn't want me to pursue something better than that. 

I hate her so much. She makes my life so hard and makes me feel worthless all the time. I just wanna die. My life would be so much better without her in it. I'm not gonna improve while she's hurting me like she does, so I'll never get better."
461,I can't enjoy things anymore without them being ruined.,"Always wanted to message my mom, since she was never around me that much. She had telegram and of course I added her, then my Dad noticed I was on telegram. He constantly wont stop inviting me to a family group, and since I didn't join. He just yelled at me, saying i'm worthless, going to die alone, and always going to stay alone. If I don't like anything that he likes, I always get yelled at or pushed hard away. He constantly ruins everything for me, I can't enjoy my life anymore. I can't talk to my friends for 5 minutes without him constantly yelling at me for things I didn't do, I just wish life would end. I am becoming fat and he won't let me go to the gym or exercise in general. I am forced to stay home and I can't do anything. Why the fuck does my life have to be like this?"
462,Just want to do it already.,"I just want to fucking kill myself already. I'm too scared to because I don't know whats after it. I feel so much emotional pain constantly. I'm so miserable and I really just want out. I really need the courage to not be afraid. I don't want to be here anymore, and I mean that."

464,Talking to an ex before committing suicide?,"Just I wanna know people’s thought on the effects of her, even though I shouldn’t care.

I had a ex of whom I loved deeply, only thing is she treated me like crap.

One day she’ll be texting me all this love crap, another minute when she was hot and wanted fun.

We’d meet as often as possible.

I worked and always made time for her, she blew me off on dates we’d set up to hangout on the weekend on our days off and had already set time aside.

Always excuses, she’s said she’s overslept or forgot or wild blame some small bump she got on a plane and said her memory was bad. It literally felt like she was trying to treat me as if I was forgettable or just push it out there.

I found out one night she was talking to someone else and was broken, I left the house to drive back home and never look back. I was upset and she called me non stop. My stupid ass picked back up and got sucked back in. All that crap she cared about me etc meant nothing. I put so much time in with her.

Honestly I would have been fine being friends if she took it that direction instead of playing with me.

I just want to ask why did she play with me.


the last thing she did to me before we broke up was went and blew me off when I had set aside a weekend to hangout with her off and instead she told me she had to work the full weekend she played it off she kept telling me it was work and I knew something was wrong. A week passed and we were breaking up and she had a weekend to her self as a sex slave for some pussy college kid. 

I just want to ask why.
My suicide plan is set in stone that’s not the discussion, she’s not the reason I’m doing it like I have my own problems I’ve had long before her I am in no way shape or form blaming her.

I’m not saying the way she treated me didn’t effect me mentally but at the end of the day I’m still not here to bash her.

My question is, at the point Im ready to do this.
Should I even call? I feel like if she heard the news
some small part in her would be upset that I went through with it. She’s tried getting in contact after our breakup but I was so betrayed and hurt by everything (what I mentioned isn’t much but I’d rather not go into detail really) 

Would anyone in my situation call?"
465,Do people with suicidal thoughts/tendencies see the world as it really is?,"I have suicidal thoughts just thinking about how life seems to be meaningless in this world of suffering and depression. Just about everything you try to do is temporary and the struggle to achieve that temporary ""whatever-it-is-you-desire"" is difficult. Once that is achieved you are back to ground zero. You got what you wanted and now you are depressed and sad again trying to obtain something else that might give you a permanent sense of life, but in reality it is just temporary.

I believe a lot of people with suicidal thoughts/tendencies realize this and have just given up on this 'routine' called Life. I myself feel depressed most of the time and just wish I was better off dead soon. I have tried to come out of this state but that again is itself temporary and I feel drawn towards depression again.

Hope someone can help out on how to overcome this state."
466,Help me,Please help. I don't know what to do but I just can't do it anymore. I'm crying my eyes out and I feel like a pussy but I just need someone to talk to.
467,:),"I honestly just want to die. There's no one reason, i just don't want to go on anymore. I already tried twice, i don't know if any of this is real anymore. Third times a charm, right ?"
468,I think I finally have the ability to do it.,"There’s a point on my commute where you merge onto a different highway and there’s 3 empty lanes overlooking a big field far below. Sometimes I like to play chicken with myself and close my eyes and see how far I can drift across the lanes until I get too scared. 

I’ve always had one-off thoughts of suicide since my childhood, but this year has really pushed me further and further to the point where I have daily fantasies about killing myself. I don’t think anyone has ever fully understood who I am and what I go through, and people I have tried to open up to are always unwilling to accept that I’m mentally ill or pushed away by me. 

I’ve had constant chills through the past months. My anxiety and depression are wrecking my health and my ability to be a productive person. I can’t focus on tasks or achieve anything of worth. It’s hard to go outside. I’m at the age of applying for college and I’ve barely done anything because I don’t believe that I’ve ever had anything worth developing. I’m a failure. Everyone around me is unaware of my thoughts, and I’m worthless compared to all of them. My only worth has been accrued through what I’ve done for others; looking back, it’s like I’ve never been my own person at all. 

I don’t think anyone really knows me as a person. There’s nothing to care about anyways. I’m not really sure what the point of this post is; I guess it’s the cry for help that I’m too scared to do in real life. I don’t know if it’ll be today or tomorrow or next week, but I think sooner than later I’m going to close my eyes and let my car careen off the highway and carry me to the only fate I think I deserve."
469,I just don't want to go on,"The idea of taking my own life is now constantly on my mind, I go to therapy, take my meds, but I still find myself feeling profoundly sad, abandoned and hopeless; I would normally rage and get out of it, but now I don't have the energy to get myself angry, I don't find joy in my work or my partner or my friends, or my hobbies, or my family; I just want to end it all, but I'm scared of failing, I'm scared it will hurt, and I don't want to bring any more grief to my mother, who's so supportive of me, and that is what's stopping me right now. I'm just so sorry with the people that are close to me, everyone has tried so hard to help me, to make me feel better, even I've tried, it just doesn't work, maybe it's the way its it's supposed to be, maybe my brain isn't wired correctly and and the chemicals just won't do what they need, I just know that I'm in so much pain and sadness that I just want it to end."
470,I don't want to live anymore? The world is too cruel?,
471,Anorexia recovery makes me want to kill myself,"Im a 24 year old man. Why is this an issue I even have?? What the hell happened to me? I used to be popular. I have slept with over 50 girls..now I can't even look another human in the eye, let alone seduce a beautiful woman. Im a fat useless anxiety ridden loser with no friends and no life

I wanted to recover to improve my life but I just made it worse. At least when i was anorexic I looked kind of good in a deathly way. Now im just a skinny fat ugly fuck

Why am i so fucking fat. I can't control myself anymore. I lost the one thing in life i had control over. I thought when i gained weight i was supposed to get my mental clarity back but no my brain is like mush 

My body isn't even repaired I'm just fat now.  My hair isn't growing back and my bones are still riddled with osteoporosis. Im not going to live much longer. I think i will become addicted to drugs again so they kill me quicker"
472,I’m too unmotivated to commit suicide,I’m so unmotivated I can’t even bring myself to do it.
473,Need help can't afford to get it.,"I need help. I'm not okay. I haven't been for a long time. I've always had some kind of mood issue. I took 200mg of lamictal twice a day for it but I no longer have insurance and I can't find a good job that offers any worth getting. My wife had an affair 3 years ago and it still eats me up we tried marriage counseling and it didn't really help. We went through like 4 counselors and I just gave up finding one I liked. We have two kids. I think part of the reason I stayed is because we are too broke to split and I don't see anyone else wanting me anyways. I WANT to die. I WANT to stop hurting and feeling like this but the sad fact is I'm to chicken shit to do anything about it. I need help I know this isn't normal but I can't get any. If I go to a hospital and say ""hey I want to kill myself"" I'll get sent away for a few weeks and then released and given a big fat bill. While I'm gone I won't be working and the little bit I do make won't come in and we won't be able to make rent. Back when I had a good job I thought about killing myself and making it look like an accident so my family would get the life insurance money. But I figured I'd fuck it up somehow and they'd be left with nothing. I don't know why I'm here. I guess I just went to vent."
474,I don't know if this is fucked up but...,"...and please, please, PLEASE don't take this wrong way but....

I thought MY life was fucked up until I read some of your stories. 

People have been telling me all of my life, ""No matter how bad you think you have it, someone out there has it worse than you.""

But that always seemed so... *abstract* to me.

Everytime someone said that to me that I wanted to scream: ""WHO?! WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?!""

All my life I wondered that. 

Until today.

You.

YOU are those people.

Reading your stories has turned those abstract phrases into a reality.

A reality of people I can hear from.

A reality of people I can talk to.

I can't communicate with the abstract 'starving kid in Africa'.

But I CAN communicate with the real you.

And now I CAN'T kill myself - because after hearing what you have been through... and the fact that you are still holding on... fighting... struggling... never giving up... everyday...

I know I can do it too.

Don't get me wrong. 

This isn't a permament cure. 

Once I put down this phone, I have to go back to dealing with my own reality, and I'll probably feel as shitty as I felt before.

But I'll be able to handle it. Because now I know that YOU are going through something so much more at any given moment, and yet you're still holding on.

So I can too.

I almost didn't write this post because I didn't want anyone to fee like I was mocking them, or trying to pick myself up by putting your lives down.

My message is this:

**Thank you. Thank you for being strong. For holding on. For fighting through. For sharing out. For inspiring within me, through your stories, a hope and an inner strength that I didn't even know I had.**

No matter how bad your life is just know that there's at least one person - not an abstraction, but a real person (me) - that is reading your story and drawing from your strength in order to carry on another day through their own miserable existence.

Everyday you're alive, you're saving *my* life just by existing.

So please continue to exist. 

Save me another day.

Thank you."
475,I don't want to live anymore? The world is just too cruel?,
476,Feeling quite lost and not sure how to proceed with my life. Is there a way out?,"I'm 19M living in a foreign country, moved here with my family from our  home with the hopes of our lives being better on many levels but I've  simply encountered many disappointments instead.

During  this past year I've had a massive relapse back into depression and a  self-destructive habits much like when I was 15. I had been trying to  come out to my mother about being gay and how deathly afraid I am that  my parents will disown me because the culture of our nation is  heteronormative and expects children, so being the only child in my  close family I feel like a disappointment. Ever since I turned 18 my  father in particular has been bothering me to find a girlfriend at  least, so I feel like I cannot talk to them about the fact that I am gay  because the first time I attempted to some years back was met with  actively threatening me with violence and throwing me out on the  streets, despite the context being that I was very suicidal at that age.  At this point I feel as if I am a mute shell on the outside because I  am not allowed to feel comfortable with myself and who I am or else I  will be disowned. Because I do depend on my parents financially, I can  never speak up no matter how much it hurts me. The years living here  were really stressful and I thought I could simply move out at one  point, but I want to study and could not support myself financially  until I finish university which I still haven't enrolled for because I'm  in my senior year in high school. Since my parents do not speak the  language of the country we moved to really well, I'm always forced to  translate and be there with them for appointments, do all their  paperwork, contracts, letters, tax returns and phone calls... And I've  been doing this since I was 14.

All  this bottled up depression that I can't even get proper treatment for  is now manifesting in me skipping school often even though I manage to  keep a fairly high GPA (US equivalent would be roughly 3.5 ish from the  top of my head). Psychologists in my area don't feel very genuine, I do  not feel relieved when talking to them or as if I am being taken  seriously. I can't change who I am and it makes me feel very alone in  the face of everything because my parents do not know me intimately and  cannot accept me, nor do I have anyone to confide in this place because I  always have to contain myself and give people the answers they want to  hear. It's taking such a toll on me especially as of late where my sleep  schedule is becoming so irregular that I wake up several times during  the night and pass out from exhaustion, sleep through all of my alarms  and miss the whole day of school trying to recuperate despite still  feeling very physically weak.

Is  there any way I could proceed or get out of this situation? I'd like to  hear your thoughts on the matter because I'm running out of  perspectives. Not sure if I should even go to university or not because I  would be financially dependent on my parents throughout my whole  college education because moving out and rent are expenses that are just  too big for me and part-time jobs have a fixed income that would not  suffice to pay rent, let alone feed myself. I'm sorry for the long post,  I feel very dreadful because it seems like I am running out of options and it's scary because my suicidal tendencies are catching up."
477,I need out of the horrid horrid situation I’m in. The feelings won’t go away it’s just a waiting game. I have one round in the chamber next to me. Not going to do it but thinking.,"I have a child on the way. And the mother insists space from me. Has mentioned not letting me see my child as much as I might want to if things go south between us. But it feels like things already have. She keeps telling me she doesn’t know if she wants to be with me anymore. She told me she doesn’t know if she still has the same feelings anymore. She keeps being short with me, doesn’t want to go out with me, and doesn’t talk to me much throughout the day. Despite carrying my child. I have been able to argue how all my other problems before now weren’t permanent. But this one arguably is. Not one other soul knows about my state of mind at the moment."
478,I cant go on like this anymore,"Im 12 years old (M).

yesterday i told my dad that i am homosexual hes going to disown me for it. today i told the boy i have a crush on how i felt but he rejected me and  told me that i am a faggot now everyone calls me out on it 

&amp;#x200B;

goodbye cruel world ;("
479,I just need someone to talk to,I need to let out a few words
480,Well I feel like my life has become my worst nightmare,"And I can’t even fix it. Everything is coming at me once and I’m just paralyzed to do anything about it  because I feel like if i would make it it worst. I don’t know what to do right now. I prayed but I feel like I’m just talking to myself at this point. I know taking my life isn’t better option but I just wish my nightmare of a life would be over. I don’t know what do right now and I don’t think I’m strong enough to bear this shit. And the worst is I still believe in God. I believe and know that his protection me, guiding me, and leading me too the way but I don’t know where. I don’t what to do right now but like the lady on the suicide hotline said maybe I do."
481,I dont get the reasons people give out to not commit suicide,"At the moment Im still afraid of death, not that it scares me but because im a massive scaredy-cat i fear the pain. I constantly oversleep and just stare at the ceiling wishing i didnt exist. Constantly feeling like im embarassing my friends and while being someone who likes talking to people, im shit at doing so even after constant practice while i seem like a creep. So i have talked about considering suicide and am interested in the reasons people have for wanting to commit it but also the reasons people give out so someone hopefully doesnt do it.

But half the time the reasons given to a suicidal person seem....very weird? Such as telling someone that ""life might get better"" or ""life will always get better"" ive known people who never got better and lived in misery for their entire life. Or a reason like ""you never know what happy things youll miss"" when the person clearly isnt tethered to things that make them happy all too much. It just seems weird to me, is it a sense of trying to save someone that people give these reasons?"
482,I honestly don't know how to make it till old age so I die of natural causes,"I dont want to die. But I have so many issues regarding mental health that sometimes pain just becomes too much. 

And honestly Im not even living for myself anymore, I simply exist so ppl would not suffer due to me killing myself. I dont want to cause any problems to my family.

I had a reaally bad day and would like to hug someone who understands, because nobody in my life does understand. I feel so lonely.

When I was younger I could distract myself with tv, games...nowdays nothing works. I just don't want to be in pain, I don't think that I ask for too much."
483,I feel my suicide would bring people closure,"I'm getting exhausted of repeating my story, but basically I used to be an incredibly harsh and relentless bully. It was because I felt like my friends were ""fake"", and it would cause me to feel miserable for so long, until I decided to act out. I felt like they were fake because I was so insecure, and figured it I hated myself so much, nobody could genuinely be my friend, and that everyone secretly hated me.

I emotionally tormented people, but recently I've changed, apologized to the people I hurt and even tried to do things like buy them concert tickets, not even to win them back but have them believe I was genuinely sorry. They probably just thought I was being manipulative.

Honestly, if I killed myself, I feel like a handful of people would feel at rest. They would know that I felt so much guilt from my actions that I couldn't go on. I ruined my life and this is how I want to go out."
484,sad,"I have found who I firmly believe to be the love of my life. He's more important to me than anything else. Sometimes though I wish I could push him away so I could let myself die.

I am in a lot of pain physically. I spend pretty much everynight shitting and vomiting - I don't really know what's wrong with my body but eating just makes me so sick. I cannot keep any weight on because of it, but I guess that is okay because I have severe self esteem/body issues. I have chronic back pain, and my hip hurts because it's damaged from tumors. I suffer from migraines, and sometimes they happen while I am having my digestive tract murder itself

I spent a lot of my life being a very terrible person. I have really really hurt a lot of people, and have only recently began to process the guilt.  I receive a lot of death threats / messages, as a result of this.  I don't know how to go to therapy to talk about a lot of it, because I'm scared &amp; some of what I've done is technically illegal. 

My connection to my family has never been good, my mother was very emotionally distant and would punish / chastise me for being ""emotionally weak""  when I was very young. Things like crying when she would pinch me, and calling me a liar when I would break my bones or say I was in pain. She did not show me very much positive physical attention.  She was/is very prone to rapidly shifting from kindness to aggression. She never let me have a place in conversation, and would come storming into my room late nights sobbing and telling me I'm awful to her and ruined her life and that she wishes I was born with a disability etc.

The panic attacks are frequent, likely because I suppress all my feelings whenever I can.

If I was not in love  I would kill myself. But I know that even if he did not love me and left me, I couldn't kill myself because he would feel as if it was his fault. And I don't want him to feel that :("
485,Supposed to be Happy,"Not a throwaway as I'm too lazy to make one. Some friends planned a cabin trip awhile back and invited me, I've been genuinely excited thinking just being with friends will help me get out of this depression.
So yesterday was great! Board games, meeting some new people and seeing friends I haven't seen in quite awhile. Now it's the second day and I feel awful. Now I just realise that I have very little in common with these people and that most of them don't care about me. That's fair, I want to play games with them but I just feel so tired. I've just been sitting off to the side hoping I'll feel better. I've been in this corner on my phone for the last three and a half hours.
Honestly this was supposed to be my last go at it, hoping that being with friends will help me realise there's more out there for me to live for. Now I feel even worse."
486,I’m near the end of rope.,"Shame, guilt, self hatred, hopeless, alone. 

I’m alone and I have a knife and I keep thinking about it. It won’t be today but everyday I’ll cut a little deeper. Until I just bleed out one day. 

I need to talk to someone but I can’t think of anyone. Besides my problems are so stupid. I hate myself so much. Like a raging fire of self hate. I’m worthless. I don’t have a solution. All I ever do is dig the hole deeper. I do it to myself. It’s me. I’m the problem. I can’t seem to change. Why would I tell anyone that? They’d think I’m stupid as fuck. Causing my own problems then complaining. I am trash.

It used to be just ideas. But lately I just sit in this room. Make decisions that make my problems worse. Keep putting things off. I’m the one letting it build up. All this makes it worse. They are turning into actions. I used to tell myself “u won’t” but now I have this feeling of wanting to make it happen. 

Like I need yo die. I don’t deserve to exist. I’m a parasite. I just burden people . I need it to end this."
487,I think of suicide daily,"For the past 4 months now, I think of suicide daily. I pick up a knife to prepare food and imagine slitting my wrists in the bath. I cross the street and imagine myself allowing myself to be run over. I hate what my life has become. I feel like I exist in some sort of limbo state between life and death. Like my life has already passed and now I’m waiting to die. I’m a walking corpse. My dreams, my hopes, all utterly crushed by the weight of the world and my own pathetic inability to cope with people. I exist only to continue my own existence. Utterly pointless.

I isolate myself more and more and struggle not to drink. It feels like all I see lately is the worst in people and yet I feel disgusted in myself too for becoming embittered, uncaring and arrogant beneath my transparent veil of politeness. It’s getting harder to keep the mask up. I haven’t the energy anymore so I painfully grimace a smile and try to exit the conversation before the dreaded personal questions arise. 

I go to uni and find myself unable to look people in the eye. Partly a sense of shame in myself and the joke that is my life. Partly a fear that people will be able to sense how I’m feeling through eye contact. Partly even a feeling of shame about possibly liking someone or displaying emotion of some kind in relation to them or what we end up talking about. 

My eyes are empty now. They’re just dead. My facial expressions largely none existent from years of abuse and collected hurts. People find me scary and intimidating and yet the irony is, it’s me that’s scared. Scared of getting hurt. So my face is blank for the most part. Impersonal. Emotionless. Inside I want to cry. Inside I die a new death everyday as I mourn what I once had. Hope, enthusiasm, vigor and love.

Having attempted suicide before, I know it’s getting bad now. I’ve started having disturbing intrusive thoughts of harming myself in public. I wouldn’t, but I’ve felt this way before. It’s a plea for people to recognise the pain I’m in and hear me. 

Fear holds me back from killing myself ultimately, but I know from experience that once the pain of living outweighs the fear of death, it’s over. I don’t know what will happen in this regard. If and when that breaking point will occur, is impossible to determine.

A part of me naively clings to the hope that if I say the right words, if I believe the right things, if I pray enough, things will change somehow. That I’ll be saved from the pointless, solitary, unloving and unloved life I live. Maybe if I give up hope enough, maybe then hope will appear? I doubt it. I feel true despair. Nothing, not meaning, not purpose, not love nor person is coming. I am on my own in this prison I call my mind."
488,I Found the solution,The best feeling to not feel depressed is to numb everything or sleep all day till something shitter happens then get more numb is the best feeling
489,both of my parents died before i was 16. now im 18 and life doesnt seem worth it (long),"i have a mind that allowed me to escape most of my childhood abuse and trauma. i explored other worlds inside of my head and mostly kept out the things that were going on around me. physical abuse, psychological manipulation, severe neglect... i trudged past them and continued to be a good kid. i was always happy. i loved art and reading and writing. i loved cartoons. i continued to be me and didnt let the abusers destroy me. now, my best friend, my mother, is gone. she died two years ago. my dad, two years before her. there wasnt a year in high school i didnt have a direct family member die. i thought the abuse would subside. it didnt. the abuser only grew more powerful-- vindicated that now my greatest allys, my parents, arent there to protect me anymore. the physical abuse is gone now, mostly due to my abuser growing older and being sickly. but the emotional abuse, even on its best day makes me feel like a scared child, alone again. my parents werent good to me either (drug abuse and neglect) but at least they served as a protective layer between me and the abuser...
im trying now to move out. move on. i want to change my name, dye my hair and leave all of this behind. my friends are not good people. they try to help me sometimes, when its convienient for them. but otherwise they just watch me suffer. i guess they dont know how to help me. i wish they would at least try. but the task probably seems daunting to them. my best friend doesnt have the same excuse-- shes been through sexual abuse and is much older than me. i expected her to be different than my peers, to understand me better. and she does. but most of the time lately, it feels like shes just another person who doesnt give a fuck. my abuse doesnt keep them up at night. they dont shed tears over my pain. but i do for them. 
i look at this world sometimes and i dont see anything. not a single thing worth staying for. i cling tk everything, the sunset, the grass, stray cats, houses with christmas lights... all of these are reasons ive chosen to wake up the next morning. but the pain far outweighs these things. coming home to a house that nobody loves you. going to work and getting yelled at. going to school youre failing in for the first time in your life. i dont have a place anywhere. i dont have a sanctuary. and sometimes the sanctuary in my mind is enough but honestly... it isnt anymore. it isnt enough. i need some semblance of life. why even live just to be a lightning rod for the hatred around me? id rather be dead. wherever my mom is, thats where i want to be. i need a hug from her. some guidance. i dont want to live without her and i dont want to live with this abuse. theres so many hoops to jump through to get to where i need to be. i worked so hard as a child, i maintained my sanity and my morals only for this to be the outcome? i thought good things come to those who wait. im waiting. i dont want to wait anymore"
490,"Sorry for the long post, I’m just lost I dk what to do","My first attempt was in 2009. I attempted again in 2017 after I had  knee surgery and since have attempted several times.  It’s like my life has just gone down hill. I mean my knee is fine now I do have some pain at times. It’s like part of me is just ready to die and be done with this life and it’s stress, and hurt, and emotional pain and then another part wants to live to watch my kids grow and maybe one day have grandkids etc.  I’ve been impatient too many times since 2017 I’ve lost count.  I’m tired of having to keep my true feelings inside and not being able to really tell anyone I personally know about how I’m really feeling. If I tell anyone I’m suicidal they tell me oh you have no reason to feel this way or oh you have everything in life and again it’s back to no reason to feel that way. I’ve also been told several times that everything that goes wrong is MY FAULT! So I feel like a complete failure . That nothing i do is good enough..."
491,Give me 5 good reasons in 5 days to NOT commit Suicide (besides Christmas- that’s too easy).....,"I’m in my 40’s, a typical “probably going to commit suicide white male”, I have a wife who pretty much hates me but loves money and I’ve been out of work on/off for two years, with little hope of new prospects. 

My daughter is awesome. We have had a great relationship, lots of imagination and daddy-daughter time, but she’s 15, and pretty much learns everything from her mom, so she’s seeing what a failure I am. She also really doesn’t need me around too much anymore anyways, she’s going to be driving soon, is an only child, and pretty independent. 

Her mom (my wife) owns a very successful photography company and could even be more success if I were out of the picture because her and my daughter could move to a location on large farm and sell out beautiful home and make bank to build a new structure/studio on property with her parents - no mortgage, all cash, and they’d both be set for life. 

All that would require is me being out of the picture. 
It’s probably honestly the most selfless thing to do really, to off myself and give them the life they want and deserve anyways. 

I’m pretty much done being a failure, being told by everyone and everything that because I’m a white male I’m worthless anyways, and really just tired of being tired and failing for almost two years. 

So here’s the challenge Reddit peeps! 
Give me 5 reasons in 5 days why I shouldn’t just pull the trigger? 
As Kylo Ren said right before he murdered his father Han Solo, “I know what I need to do but I don’t know if I have the strength to do it...”"
492,I’m killing myself tonight but I don’t want to,I wanted to do something with my life. But school is tearing me apart and I’m being bullied constantly and have no reason to live. There’s nothing for me here. Idk if I should or not but the pain is ongoing. I have/had 29 diagnoses. I can’t take it anymore
493,I refuse to live to see age 30.,"I'm turning 29 on Dec. 30th, and I've decided this is the last Christmas I will suffer through. I don't have a specific method, but I will do increasingly risky things until I die.

My reasons:

I'm gay. My mom's side of the family is openly homophobic. They use the f word all the time and equate gay with pedophilia. My dad doesn't believe in sexual orientation and he thinks it's a choice because I can't find the right woman. He has a gay cousin and tells stories about how he's disgusting.

I don't have the superficial charm needed to get ahead in the world. Trying to get a career is just rejection after rejection until I'm stuck doing some repetitive crap like working at Wal-Mart. I'm stuck with a student loan and nothing to show for it. When I stopped paying, my dad took it into his own hands and manipulated and guilted me into throwing thousands of dollars down that well for him. I don't care about my credit score. I've never bought anything but my education on credit. And the remainder of the debt will be discharged when I'm dead anyway whether there is $500 or $5000 left when that day rolls around.

I have no friends or real connections, and I've failed in maintaining any because I'm such a failure. There's my mother who is an on/off switch; my 14 year old brother who hates me except when he wants something from me; my dad who just oblivious. Christmas is a horrible time for me because I'm stuck pretending I love my dad's wife's family when she abused me emotionally and sexually for all my childhood. No matter what gifts I give them, it's not enough, and Christmas is just a horrible guilt trip.

My dad and his wife are alcoholics and they fight all the time and go on long rants insulting me over the phone when they get drunk every night. If I don't answer, they go through my childhood bedroom and find stories I wrote to humiliate me with.

And this is a whiny reason on its own, but it's often the final straw that keeps me in bed crying some days. I can't stand the cold. If I wake up and it's below 30 degrees, I just sit there for 20 minutes unable to even force myself to reach over to pick up my glasses.

Nothing is going to get better. I can't just reset my life with a new family and circumstances. I can't change who I am enough to be accepted by other people."
494,Life is starting to feel like it can only end in suicide..I have no options no hope..either suffer indefinitely or stop all the pain...,I can’t handle it anymore..life..it’s so overwhelming and I feel like I’m fucking suffocating and I have no one no help no one to turn to I feel like my only option to ever feel happiness is to commit suicide already..I just want to throw on my favorite movie take a fuck ton of sleeping pills and drift away and feel genuine happieness again one last time...because I really don’t think it’ll happen ever again for me..I’ll never be happy with my life..and every day I wake up I just find new reasons on why suicide is the best option
495,I have no idea what to say for this title I'm just really panicked right now,"I do not know what to do, I do not know what I hope to accomplish by posting this. I think I'm actually going to die. I everything is set in place I just have to go do it. I want to vomit. I shaved my head (not bald) and i cut up my cheek. I have been cutting for 3 or 4 days now, I haven't really told anyone. Just thinking this is hurting me, not even saying it out loud, I feel so sick. My parents will take my to the hospital if they see me, I cannot go through that again. I can't be around my parents I need to get away from them. They are not abusive or anything, they are great parents and they take very good care of me but I need to get away from them it is killing me. I have no one to talk too. I messaged one of my friends and she ignored me so I think I scared her, I just tried to cover it up by saying that I was just having a bit of an episode and then I changed the topic, she hasn't seen that message yet. My other friend doesn't really talk to me anymore. I am losing myself I hate myself I hate myself. I understand the problem now completely, I know what is upsetting me and it is my physical being. I cannot change that. I need to get out. I want to die. I need to do something before my parents come home. Holy shit, if I dont die I'm going to be so embarrassed and feel like a coward. I'm so panicked right now I'm shaking and I think I'm going to cry."
496,I am too scared to commit suicide,I can't imagine myself getting through next year and want it to end. But I am too scared even though the whole purpose of life is to die anyway.
498,no one really cares what happens,"i tried to kill myself, got hospitalized and not a single person outside my friend group noticed i was gone. my friends may have noticed, but they don’t care because a week after it happened, they went back to ignoring me. i have panic attacks on a daily basis and my friends are just like, oh well, she’ll get over it but it’s then more than ever that i need their support. i feel so fucking lonely and my parents found out i’m bi so they aren’t really there for me anymore. i have no one so it doesn’t really matter what happens to me. i am constantly dissociating when i’m not, i’m fantasizing about death. the only reason why i haven’t killed myself yet is because i’m afraid i’ll fail and get hospitalized again. i just want it to end. i’m so fucking done."
499,I’m very compelled to write ‘fuck people’ in my suicide note,Not because of edginess but because I’m deeply misanthropic. Is that wrong?
500,I feel so behind,"See post history for context on health. 


I just feel so fucking behind everybody and like I’ll never catch up. I see so many people thriving and I feel like I’m just a waste of space. I don’t really want to do or be anything anymore."
501,I plan on killing myself in about 2 years,"So, I am planning to kill myself. Last autumn, almost one year ago, I made the biggest mistake of my life and I just cannot live with the consequences. I was in a relationship with the most amazing, unique, sweet girl I have ever met. And after two years of trying and loving her, she had just come around and started loving me too. I was her first love... We shared our first kiss and had many amazing moments together... But one year ago, we got into a fight and I left... I WAS THE ONE TO LEAVE... And only one year later I see how grave a mistake that was... I ruined everything... I will never again have what I had... Because I want her and only her and she will never get over it and trust me again... Only the thought that she ha seen other people and it was all because of me..... I can only barely live with the thought that I once had all I desire from her now, the only way that I can get myself to get out of bed every morning is theft she is still around and we are kind of friends, although she will never forgive me and get over it.... But this is going to change soon.... She will leave and does not want me to be around her anymore...she says she wants a new beginning.... But I need her... I don't want a life without her. It hurts so much... So, if this happens, exactly one year after we talk for the last time and she severs all ties, I plan on killing myself. That one year is to not make it look like she was the cause... I don't want to Hurt her..."
502,can i please just kill myself,"i've completely lost the motivation to stay alive and with so much pressure around me, i feel like i have no choice but to kill myself."
503,idk,"
my parents are constantly fighting, afraid to go on winter break this year but i was failing my classes. my friends dont talk anymore because of the drama here, their parents wouldnt want them to come over. I have 10 siblings (one living with us, locks himself in his room) that don’t talk to me though i wish they did, give me advice for what to do or explain how they dealt with my parents. my mom is an alcoholic, at least once a week she’ll get nasty, call me names, says she’ll kill herself because she cant deal with us, hit me, etc. my dad will skip days off work because he cant get out of bed, incredibly down. hes an alcoholic as well, less functional when hes drunk but wouldnt hurt anybody. hes extremely sensitive and if someone looked at him a certain way or didnt reply to him or laugh at his jokes he’ll yell, say we dont love him or leave

an online friend ive had is honestly the only thing keeping me alive, i look forward to talking to them even though its incredibly awkward and starting to go downhill. its all i ever think about, and when theyre feeling down themselves i completely shut down. everything is so much more intense when theyre away or something is wrong over there. i know its not healthy to absolutely depend on someone else. im having a lot of trouble finding new friends and sharing the love to multiple people. im terribly shy and insecure, if i think i did something wrong ill go on an apologizing rampage and bash myself in chat and ruin the atmosphere. and then ill say sorry for that too. ill go away for weeks because i think i deserve it and that they would want me to. come back and apologize because id worried them, feel awful. similar to what my dad does.l

theyve been having a lot of trouble on their half as well, itd be another paragraph to explain it though. weve been exchanging vents but its only tearing us two apart, and we know it. weve gone over it, started over, a million times. if they go i will too

i know i have to look ahead to ever get through it, but right now i dont know if I even see a future at all. and i know there are countless people going through unimaginable situations, feels so selfish to even vent. i believe that if youre your top priority, youll take care of yourself no matter what environment youre in. but if youre not, youre just gonna bully yourself no matter where you go. idk how to move forward, ive tried so many times, i can predict how people try to help, twist it around and make it negative

it feels so pointless, i ask them if they want to talk, they say “i do” when were both aware that it will fall again, we’ll hurt ourselves again, shit will happen over and over.  but i cant leave it, nor can i leave this house. even if i got away its still in my head, im stuck forever unless i go. everyday i go to school itching to go home to hurt myself, unless my friend is happy then i am. so mad at myself feel like ican do anything"
504,I can’t think of anything else,"I don’t want to kill myself but my body keeps bringing it up on its own, it’s a reaction to discomfort of any kind. I went back thru my contacts/people I used to know and I’ve realized how many people have shunned me or offend me. I feel like I can’t plant my feet ever again because I’ve just fucked the soil beneath me time and time again. I trust no one, even my closest friends are playing two sides of a court. I keep hyping myself up to kill myself but never get anywhere, now I’m thinking in solid terms about doing this. I see nothing positive coming my way, I can’t escape this cycle, I can’t escape this place."
505,Does anyone want to chat,Honestly Im(F18) just fkng depressed and want to talk to someone here just like a friend.i don't know if thats weird but ok.
506,I need to talk to someone,If anyone wants to talk to me we can chat in private... Just one person.
507,Does anyone else feel like this?,Do you talk about surface feelings? Like you can tell someone you are sad or that you care about them and it come off as uninterested? Like you NEED to talk about something you’ve buried inside yourself but you literally can’t it just sits inside of you and eats at you? Like you want to tell people how you really feel but for some reason the emotion is too strong good or bad and verbally can’t say it because it makes you physically sick so you constantly feel like your living a lie because you can’t actually tell people how and what you feel or think. Like you’ll never be able to open up so you just tell people whatever they want to hear and feel?
508,I'm done,I'm 15(f) and I am done. I am done with my crap life. I am nothing more than a worthless human being. I can't take the pain anymore.
509,Am I petty?,"Hey guys. Idk but for some reason, I’ve caught myself being jealous of other people’s parents who seem to have a close relationship with their children. Comparing their relationship with mine just made me really sad. Just recently, I’ve been viewing my mom’s nagging to be hurtful, for some reason and I’m really taking it to heart. Due to a lot of circumstances, I’ve been seeing myself as someone worthless and unloved. 

What the fuck do I do? What the fuck is happening? I thought I was stronger than this? Why am I seeing myself as someone who can just disappear? 

Would really appreciate some input"
510,It's been quite some time.,"Hi reddit.  I find myself in a headspace I thought I had left behind.  I'm on the other side of a meltdown/ panic attack or whatever and I feel exhausted.  I'm drained but cant sit still.  I feel frozen to inaction but feel an unstoppable need to change something. 

My thoughts all focus on not wanting this anymore.  I'm so tired of the struggle.  Struggle to pay Bill's, stay groomed, keep the place clean, car, insurance, social life, work, dad time, sleep.  Everything is a struggle.  Nothing feels smooth or easy going.

It's all so hopeless.  I've been so lonely since my wife left.  I just had my first rejection post divorce and it hurt me way more than I expected.   I was foolish to think I'd be stronger for what I went through.  

The ativan are kicking in hard.  I'll try and get some sleep and hope my mind can leave the darkest thoughts behind by the time I wake up. Sorry for the rambling."
511,Voices,Is it dangerous to hear voices...
512,Need to rant (work),"The roads have been an absolute mess where I live and I let my boss know *well* in advance that I couldn’t guarantee I could make it in. I let him know this morning per his request over email and text and it’s still counted against me just because I didn’t call. 

For all you know, I could’ve been testing the roads to see. Sorry, but I’m not going out over 20 miles in this shit for just above minimum wage. You may not respect me (hardly anyone shows a bit of decency anymore) but I’m trying so hard to value my life over being someone’s verbal punching bag for 8 hours. Next time, maybe I will just go out and get myself killed. Maybe your scrawny vegan ass would be happy then. As would a lot of fucking people.

Or better yet...I’ll just hang myself in the back room or blow my brains out at the register. That would be quite a spectacle."
513,I’m not doing too good,Just so u know before I start this probably won’t be written well. I’m not really much of a writer so this will probably be disorganized and everything. I’m not really sure where to start honestly. I’m on my way to work right now. I do construction so I’m in a van on the way to the job. Im smoking a bowl with my boss. A lot of times when I’m talking i sorta avoid the actual topic for some reason. That’s kinda caused me problems because it seems like no one can really enjoy a conversation with me. Every time I talk to someone it just feels empty u know? Like there’s nothing behind the words. It doesn’t feel like there’s anyone that’s cares about me. Like my boss for example. I actually do care about him. I’m not entirely sure why. He used to work with another brother I had who passed away 3 years ago which is another fucking thing im dealing with. I’ve never been closer to anyone than I was with my brother. His name was Brent.  The 8th was the anniversary of his death and his birthday is Thursday. Whenever we lived together we mostly just hung out and played video games. My uncle Ken used to come over and play video games. A lot of times I’d watch them play oblivion or fallout 3 or new Vegas. But he also passed away a few months ago. I’m living in his house now. It feels like I don’t really speak anymore. I’ve always had a problem with talking. It was like I’d have the thoughts and ideas in my head but when I try to put them into words it just comes out wrong. It’s always been that way but since my brother died it’s different. Some days it’s not as bad and some days it’s worse. In a lot of ways I’ve grown as a person in a lot of ways since he passed but it’s not always like that. Sometimes I’ll go weeks feeling terrible and I make bad decisions. It feels like i can stop breaking things. There’s a ton of dents in my door from punching it. I’ve also broken a mirror another door that’s broken off the hinges and various other things. I used to be good at composing myself. Even though I was depressed and felt completely shitty sometimes I could always keep my calm and try to act reasonable. But I can’t do that anymore. I lose control and I just do things and it doesnt feel like i was given a chance to decide whether or not i should do it cuz I just act. I feel bad for my dog. When I get upset it affects him too. I feel like I can’t kill myself because of him in a way. He likes other people but him I’m his whole world. He follows me everywhere. I also don’t want to because of the people left that care about me. But sometimes i don’t feel like they care but I still know in the back of my mind that it would hurt them if I do that. But anyway I might write more later but we’re almost at the job. So idk take it easy I guess
514,I've been extremely happy for the past few days,"Last week I relapsed into a vicious cycle of self harm. Its a nasty habit I picked up when I was a kid. It didnt help, I just felt embarrassed for doing that shit as an adult. Nothing can ease the pain now.
I went hiking yesterday, alone. It was such an enjoyable experience. I felt calm and happy, smiling the whole way. That was the first time I went outside in months. Im writing goodbye letters remembering all the good times with my friends and family, the bad stuff doesnt faze me anymore. I will give away all my stuff so maybe they will remember me as someone they can rely on, and not like the burden I became because of my illness. Only after I decided I'm doing it have I found peace. Knowing its going to happen soon gives me comfort. It will all be over."
515,My life is lie.,
516,I think I'm killing myself soon.,"My post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ebhkqn/my_girlfriend_died_in_the_hospital_after_her/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=) explains why, everyone says the same, words won't heal me, I wanna die now, in the most painful way possible,"
517,Why is higth school such a piece of shit,"My mom always told me that i should make a big Mark on higth school because Those are going to be the Best years of my life but rigth know i nothing is working
Its not Just the people saying that i look fat or that i have a abortion face its that know everytime i pass by someone the first thing that comes to my mind is that they are talking about me and of how disgusting i am and sometimes i cant hold it anymore you know
I tried suicide Once when i was 11 but o quicly stop it for some time but know after 2 years my suicida thougths are coming back
I cant sleep im tired im always overthinking things and i really cant hold it anymore
Ill try not doing anything stupid but if things keep going the way that they are i think ill problably quit"
518,I don't understand something,"I hate my life, as many people who post here do, and I really don't think I can 'get rid' of most of my problems. I have every reason to kill myself and I've even set a condition (that was met) to help me decide to kill myself.

So why haven't I finished myself off yet? I honestly can't think of any reason to live. I'm so confused..."
519,"I need help, I wanna fucking die after my GF commited suicide and died in the hospital Dec 15th 2019.","I need help moving on, I've tried to/thought about committing suicide 2 times in the last 2 days. I need help.

Edit : I booked a therapist but I want help know, every moment hurts and some people don't fucking understand that. The suicide hotline hung up.

Edit 2: For info reasons my GF died yesterday December the 15th. I am male and straight. I live in Sweden and I'm 23.

Edit 3: It's better if you write in English since I'm more used to speak English on the web.

Edit 4  Someone messaged me to do it, I might, I'm so sorry, thanks for the love, I might not do it, many of you want me to live.

Edit 5: I'm still alive, I'm going to a therapist but I just want to fucking die on the way.

Edit 6: I keep hearing the same shitty excuses, it's not my fault, hugs. I need fucking help, not the shit that I can't recognize from one and"
520,"suicide shouldn't be such a taboo. yes it's a sad situation, but for some people it's the last way out of misery, so should they really be shamed for that?","i've been thru way more shit than most people can even imagine.

and i'm serious about that. statistically and realistically (sorry bad spell) i have been thru much more than your average person, even your average depressed person.

i'm scared to kill myself, but i do honestly hope i get cancer"
521,3 weeks ago i attempted suicide and no one knows,"November 23, 2019 I attempted suicide. I have not told anyone, or very little people. I tried to hang myself due to a broken heart and stress. After the attempt i started to view the world around me differently and see that maybe i am wanted.... I haven't really felt the need to take my life after that as i met a guy whom i like a lot. The work day after my suicide attempt was different, I noticed people actually seemed to care. Or, i saw some accomplishment in myself. I yet to seek help for my mental issues, but so far im trying to figure things out."
522,Endless loop,"I have brought this all down on myself. But still its hard. I am making the most honest and genuine effort i have ever made to improve my life. Yet i feel like someone is yanking a rug from under me. Like no matter how i try, she has already made up their mind. I know there is something else, and maybe im just a duty to her until she finds what she wants. Maybe she does love and care about me, but she can't trust me enough to believe it. 

Either way. I can't go 5 minutes without thinking about a way out. I keep breaking down when she isn't looking. My fantasies of dying are becoming so clear and simple, they feel more like plans now. I just feel like i can't find a way out. When i try to reach out i just meet walls. I went to a doctor and was told i needed to see a new doctor, but they haven't made that happen. I try to reach out to the only person who might understand, but i have hurt her too badly for her to care. I sought a friend that cares, but can't really understand. I don't want to die this way, but its starting to feel like there is no other way. My mind is breaking and i don't want to be around for that final snap. I have dug my own grave, no one hurt me. I hurt myself."
523,Everything keeps getting worse,"I had what was in my opinion the best life. I went to the gym. Lived in a share house with my best friend (now ex best friend) and boyfriend (now ex boyfriend). I had to move back in with my meth using abusive mother. I just lost my job as of 2 days ago. I went to the psych today and he confirmed I'm like this forever and that there's no hope for me. Obviously he didn't use those words but you know. It hurts too much to talk to my ex as friends I can't believe he left me, he doesn't reply which is fine but it hurts. I was almost hospitalised for suicide last week and I honestly just should have gone through with it so I didn't have to see this week. I don't know why I'm posting here. If this is deleted in the morning I'm alive"
524,Tragedy...,"When you try to full screen a video on YouTube and accidentally fast forward to the end. Sad times, cheer me up"
525,I am not hap,Just so u know before I start this probably won’t be written well. I’m not really much of a writer so this will probably be disorganized and everything.

But anyway I might write more later but we’re almost at the job. So idk take it easy I guess
526,I hate my face,"My face is such a dumb shape, short and squared off, and it's so round and fat. and my nose is the most unsightly thing, it looks really small irl, and upturned like a pig, and it's like a big bulbous thing, perfectly round, it's so awful. I have these big blue dead eyes that look like muddy bug eyes, the color is not a nice kind of blue. My hair is this dark blonde perfectly straight straw, I hate straight hair, especially on me, and it gets tiring to put it up into curls. I wish I had dark curly hair and dark eyes and a thin straight nose, I wish I looked like the people I idolize so maybe I wouldn't hate what I see. I wish I looked like I could be the frontman of a band, because that's what I want to be, not this fat, soft, ugly little creature who can't even pass as a man as a trans guy despite being 6ft tall and having some masculine features. I wish I wasn't trapped in this horrible body, I want out of it so badly."
527,i just can’t live anymore,"i don’t even have the energy to rant. 
goodnight. who knows if i’ll wake up"
528,"The End, I Guess.","I’m an 18F in my senior year of high school. I live with my parents, and moving out is not currently an option. All they do is yell at me, tell me I’m a failure, lecture me, and overall make me feel like crap about myself. It’s to the point that I just don’t even feel like continuing on. I see one way out, and one way only.
I’m sorry."
529,Not sure what to do?,"I don't think I'm necessarily suicidal at the minute but my life is messing with my head atm.. work is horrible and I've applied for countless other jobs and I've never heard back and it's making me feel useless and worthless. On top of that my on/off boyfriend and I finished things for good today, I finally did what I've been shying away from for a very very long time. Sometimes when we fight we block each other but we always eventually end up coming back but I'm not sure I will this time? I feel absolutely heart broken but I'm at wits end and I'm sick of having my heart broken. I cant help feeling like I've done the wrong thing rn but I know in the long run it'll probably be better for me? It was nice whilst it was good but when it was bad it was the utmost cause of my depression and kept causing me huge anxiety attacks and stuff. I guess I just dont really know how to process it? I feel weird because I'm not crying and I dont feel upset atm.. I just feel numb and it makes me feel horrible.. makes me feel like I've lost all emotion. I realise this is a huge vent and nobody will read it and nobody will reply to it either but I just needed to vent somewhere to someone who wouldn't judge me and this is all anonymous so.. here it is I guess.. I just dont know how to process things and I feel like if I handle this badly it could completely destroy me..? :("
530,I can't continue this life,Everything has collapsed in the past few months. I don't want to do anything anymore. I'm failing multiple classes in school. I think I'm going to finally follow through on my plan tonight.
531,I HATE THE WAY I LOOK,"i am a girl ,  i am so ugly and i am flat so everyone is always making fun of me i have a boyfriend and he makes fun of me to, he has also cheated on me before we have dated for one year and he is the only person i talk to but i think he is still cheating on me so i want to kill myself"
532,I understand if this gets removed,"The other day I saw the view outside the campus window. It was night and I thought I could just run out there and vanish from everyone's lives. I know I'm a bother. My stupid life has fucked me up and I try to so hard to be better and fucking grow up, but every time nothing fucking happens. I though about different ways I could kill myself. Alcohol, basing my head against the wall. I think about it so much. Everyday I fantasize about dying because it's so much easier. It would solve so many problems, too. I don't know how to try anymore. I don't know if it's the isolation again, but I just see no future. I see no future for my worthless self. I feel like I'm just going to suck my parents dry and waste away like the pathetic shit I am.

I don't enjoy living. I don't enjoy being happy. I don't enjoy anything. I don't think I'll ever enjoy anything again. Nothing ever feels good. I feel no pride. All I ever want to do is die and be forgotten. I want my body to be lost under the wheels of a train. I want to die with no funeral. I want my body to be thrown away and never thought about again.

I think I've had an episode in every school bathroom for each school I've attended. You can also add my brother's house to that list. I don't want people to like me. Maybe I do. I don't know. I don't know which part of me to trust anymore. I never learned how to be a person. But I want to learn. God damn it I want to learn how to be a person. I don't want to do good things so people will think in good. I want to do those things because I'm a decent fucking person.

I want to be good. I want to be good so fucking bad. I just want to be good. Please tell me I can be good."
533,I'm tired. I just want an escape.,
534,big vent very confused,"i havnt been actively suicidal for a little bit now but things are starting to go downhill at them moment and i just needed to have somewhere to put my feelings. 
i came out as trans to people at school over a week ago so that i’ve got 2 months of holidays before i have to see them again. responses were all positive (as far as i can tell) but that is the extent of interaction i’ve had with anyone. all the clinics in my area are booked up and aren’t accepting new patients for a long time so i will not be able to start HRT or get top surgery for several years and continuing to live without being able to transition or come out to my family really fucking hurts. none of my friends ever want to hang out and we only ever talk if i contact them first i can and have gone weeks without a message. i’m swing a counselor (i’ve had 2 sessions) and i don’t really think we connect that much but i’m way to anxious to change and frankly i don’t know how to so instead i’ve just been cancelling my appointments. i’m 18 in 3 weeks and i hate it so much because i’ve dealt with mental illness throughout my teens and anger issues as a child i havnt made any memories and emotionally i’m way ahead of my years but in every other aspect especially compared to my peers i’m like 7 years younger than them and this imbalance just feels fucking weird. i can’t remember majority of my childhood and only remember what i think it would’ve been like plus i constantly get told by my mum that i’m just making up memories but they feel so real to me and i’m convinced they happened? 
i wrote little vent but turns out i had a lot more pent up than i realized i could go on but if you read this far down sorry for wasting your time."
535,What's the point,No one would care if I died. The only thing keeping me here is the fact that its Christmas and I dont want my parents to have to organise a funeral around christmas.
536,Some days I am really tired of living,"I am almost 44 and I have had depression since I was 10. I have a permanent physical disability, even surgery couldn’t fix it. I get treated differently by my able bodied peers. They either pity me or avoid me. Just generally make small talk which gets really boring. I was conceived out of wedlock by parents being the first child and I got the curse of life. Siblings are doing better than me. Able bodied, healthy and very attractive. I have dated in which relationships haven’t lasted for more than 6 months. I am tired of being told to learn to let go of them while my loved ones make me feel like they keep me on a tight leash. So much for “letting go.” 

I don’t have a plan. I feel too tired to even carry one out. I am just so tired of crying everyday, taking meds, trying to get out of bed and take care of everyday life stuff. My disability makes me feel isolated.

I wish I could just sleep and never wake up from this body. I wish I had a different one."
537,I have just realized then my friends don't rlly care about me,"I have other suicidal friends in my group and I realized that the others in my group who like to help...care more about them like...when the most suicidal one cuts everyone trys to stop them and when the other one cuts everyone gets them to stop and trys to make them feel better 

When I cut (they see my cuts) they don't care... their response is normally something like 'well then stop' or 'ooh that's new' I never get an actual caring response like the others do


I feel truly alone and empty"
538,I'm killing myself when i get home from work,"I'm not happy. I haven't been happy in months, and I'll be out of a job in January. So I don't see myself being happy any time soon. At this point i know i won't be able to handle the stress of being unemployed. I have no education so finding a job is hard.

I just wanted someone to know, thank you for reading."
539,Closer than ever,"I've been super sensitive since I was a kid and I have had bouts of severe debilitating depression for several months at a time for the last 9 years. I turn 27 in two days and I just don't want to make it there. I have loving and supportive family, friends, coworkers, bosses and a great fiance but it can't kill the pain inside. I have screamed for help and I feel like no one is taking me seriously. Ive been off work for three weeks because I can't function and I've been cutting myself a lot. I left the house last night in the Canadian winter with nothing but a box cutter and went to sit in a hydro field alone. The blade wasn't very sharp but I cut myself in an aggressive fit of frustration a bunch of times. I had intended to die, but i came away with pathetic scrapes. If only it had been sharper... Anyways, I guess I'll end up dead soon or in the psychiatric emergency room (hell). Hoping for the more peaceful option..."
540,Is it just me?,"I had a mental breakdown about ten years ago and actively tried to commit suicide. I was living with my parents at the time and was repeatedly told to ""snap out of it"" ""stop dramatising life"" and to just ""get on with it like everyone else"". That time passed but last year I found myself feeling suicidal again. It scared me. I decided to reach out to my sister and my husband and tell them how I was feeling. I was at breaking point. My husband wasnt too bad I suppose. He listened if nothing else. My sister though told me she had enough problems of her own to deal with and couldn't be coping with mine. 

Its left me feeling that if I do get to that point again there is nowhere to turn. People in my life dont care. Even when I make myself totally vulnerable and completely open to them. My biggest source of support is strangers that dont know me on the internet. It's pretty shit knowing your own family dont care."
541,Need someone to talk to. 30/m alone in a hotel room,
542,I don't belong anywhere,I'm too nice and even good people just end up taking advantage of me. I would rather kill myself than accepting I have to change myself to belong here by holding back on being nice to people or letting people know I love them. No one can help treating me badly once I'm close to them I'm basically not made for this world. I don't even think I'm depressed i just have no purpose here.
543,After death do you prefer nothingness or reincarnation with better life?,
544,"I don't know why I'm writing this, but I have to","At every milestone in my life where I achieve more than anyone in my family has, I feel emptier, further detached from people and feelings, and deep melancholy, constantly.  

When people ask me how I am I tell the truth with a smile and a sigh. I say that I'm dying inside, and that I'm grateful to be alive today. In response, people call me quaint and wise for my ""eccentric honesty and relatableness"". 

I know they heard what I was blatantly telling them, not even between the lines-- that those words must allude to the image of me that will live on in their memories. 

 It's the truth. I love ""life"" as an experience. I appreciate the sensation of touching the skin of fruit, the smell of my hand soap, squinting one eye to focus on something in the distance, hearing my phone ring even though I never answer any calls. I cherish the most minute and complex details of nature, but not people. This love for experiencing consciousness and self awareness and thought leaves me feeling thankful, lucky even, that I exist against the equally infinite sea of odds that I could not. It's so beautiful to ponder the chances that I was born on a planet with nature and wildlife, and further, have survived this life up until this point. 

What I've detailed is about as much emotion I feel besides a consistent inexplainable emotional heaviness.

Eager, I wait to experience the end of life. I never stop imagining my last words, or what my last meal will taste like. I wonder whether or not I'll know it is my last meal and cherish the thought of killing myself for the control I'll have over the way I die, so that I can just get the shit over with already and ensure I say goodbye to all the minutia before I go, and  especially so I can do things like cherish my last meal. I fear dying accidentally or abruptly for this reason. 

I am not concerned about my acceptance of this all, and find peace and a sense of relief in my death.  

When I finally go I just don't want my partner to blame themself. I've always felt this way but I cherished our time."
545,"My friends are moving forward in life while I feel like I'm moving backwards, thinking its time to give up","As the title says it feels like my friends are all on the come up of there depression while I'm lagging behind at this point I'm just drinking or getting high every night to cope, I can bring myself to say how I feel I just want to fade away quietly tonight is a perfect night for it so theres a good chance I dont make it through the night."
546,i dont want to,"i dont want to go to school, i dont want to go to italy to visit my family, i dont want to move to italy next year, i dont want to not sleep and play games all day, i dont want to study, i dont want to work, i dont want to do anything at all, and when i think of death its comforting, but then i realise, wait ill killmyself anyways and then i get up and do things, but then it repeats.. its an endless cycle man"
547,There’s only one way for this story to end.,"I survived and escaped an abusive relationship 3 years ago. I’d since withdrew from social situations and just doing worse by the day. During my relationship we once had to take my gf’s mom to the hospital because she tried to take her life by medication overdose. Months later, I had to pin my gf to the ground and snatch the bloody knife out of her hands because she was trying to cut her wrists. Once she threatened to frame me for physical abuse I knew I had to get out. Had to move countries, drop out of college. Spent a whole year in crippling depression, gained a lot of weight. The following year I finally thought I was getting back to a decent life. And then I herniated a disc and have no been able to walk properly for about 3 months now. I have no friends. I keep behaving poorly with my parents. Broke all relations with my sister. Have no way to fulfill my professional goals if I cannot walk properly again. I am craving some human connection, a hug, someone to confide in. But all I keep getting is more pain in my back and leg, cannot exercise, trying to quit smoking but I keep failing. I’m basically a worthless individual right now and the only way this can end is in death. I’m 26 so it may not come naturally but I’m scared I’ll end up taking my lire one day."
548,I should kill myself,"This thought just loops through my brain... I should kill myself. It'd be better for everyone else if it was something else, but goddamnit I should probably just be dead."
549,My step dad is threatening to throw me out,"I'm soon 17 and me and my mom has lived with my step dad for almost 3 year, we have never gotten along and are almost always fighting, he also often makes ""jokes"" intended to annoy and provoke me, I've been feeling like absolute shit recently and by recommendation of my therapist, I've been focusing on just staying above the water instead of going to school, both my parents absolutely hate this and often tell at me, this morning he came barging into my room screaming at me and threatened to throw me out because ""this is my house and you can't make the rules"", I really don't know what to do and I'm scared.



P.s. I'm in Sweden if you're going to link resources."
550,My best friend won't help me...,"Right now I'm with the suicide hotline and they haven't responded because they're busy. I've been having bad thoughts about my dpd and I've been trying to contact my friend but they are busy. I've spammed them a bit and they they open my message of me asking for help, but they didn't respond. I called them but they just hung up on me. I stop texting them right now cuz I think they are mad at me and I dont  want them to leave me, someone please help me please"
551,I don’t know what to say other than I can’t sleep at night because I want to kill myself,"I have been feeling the urge to kill myself a lot lately , and i recently tried to kill myself a few days ago but I can’t seem to slit my wrist correctly and deep enough to do it, but I can’t see myself living a long life, I already feel like I have over stayed my welcome on earth , and my boyfriend is really the only reason why I stay, my family has time and time again mentioned that if “ I’m so miserable , why don’t I just do it” I mean they don’t really care about suicide and as far as I’m concerned wouldn’t be to sad or upset with me for doing it ,but my boyfriend really loves me and it sucks too because I’m his first girlfriend, and I don’t want it to end like that seeing as he is my best friend but I feel like I have expired a long time ago , I am in constant fear and sadness, every waking moment I’m stressed out to the moment I fall sleep ( the very few I have), I hate that I feel this way but I literally am so close to just doing it , I am beyond help, my meds only make me sadder, and therapist don’t know my real problem and I normally am too in touch for them to really say much other than “ it will be ok” which it hasn’t been and never will be and I don’t want to go to the mental hospital because of the stories I heard and the fact that all the people i know that have been to one really don’t get anything good out of it,idk I just want to die and I think about doing it every moment I’m awake"
552,Why does shit have to change so often???,"This year I started off good it seemed like it'd be a good year, duas were nice stuff was good had a great birthday and then 

BOOM yeah that's right fuck you, no happiness for you *how dare you have happiness* I'm changing your life for the worse

Then I started adapting like a normal human would about a week or too off fully adapting

Uh uh uh what do you think your doing? Having a good life? No way! Let's go!

I denied the change was happening until it did then I denied it and became a negative asshole to everyone, attempted suicide 6 times nearly succeeded once but sadly, did not.

Now I'm about a quarter of the way to adapting and then this guy says 

New year New change! Time to adapt again you good for nothing loser!

I have 3 weeks and I'm kind of rolling up into a ball and denying life is a thing

When I nearly succeeded suicide it was bliss that 30 minute period where my brain was being a piece of shit and recovering but I was unconscious (?) was bliss, I don't really remember it but when I woke up I did punch a massive hole in my wall that I was still here.

The only reason I'm not prepping yet is because I can't put that burden on my mum, she herself would kill herself if I was gone I know that."
553,At what point do you give up when you're deeply depressed?,"I hope this doesn't violate any of the rules, I'm not sure where else to post.

I've been deeply depressed for a year now. At what point does one give up? I've tried everything - talk therapy, EMDR, medication - nothing has helped.

I was abused as a child - physically and emotionally and it has messed up pretty badly.

I've made a plan on how I'm going to kill myself, the only thing that has kept me going so long is that it would devastate my sister. However, the pain is too much now and I can't live like this anymore.

I'd be grateful if someone could give me a reason to try for some more time."
554,I feel like I’m nearing the end,"I’ve been suicidal for about 5 years now but it’s gotten a lot worse in the past year. Realistically I know people care about me and me committing suicide will be a huge pain to my family. Imagining them finding my body is the only reason I haven’t done it yet. But I feel like I’m at the brink of losing it. I’ve alienated myself from all my friends, nothing makes me happy, and even the slightest thing that goes wrong will bring me to the point of a mental breakdown. And even though my family are excellent people they certainly don’t help at times. I’m not sure if I actually care about what will happen to my family after I die or I’m just putting up excuses to not kill myself. This is the first time posting something like this on the internet and I feel silly doing it. And I’m not sure why I decided to, but I have no one to talk to so I guess this is me telling the void which is the internet what I feel. I’m so extremely empty right now. I’m very tired of living."
555,It's too hard,It's too hard to live anymore. I try to help people and give them things but they don't care. I'm not appreciated. I'm not worth it. I want to bash my fucking head into a wall until I can't move anymore. I'm trapped in a body that doesn't want me anymore. It's eating itself and everything hurts. I can't fucking take it anymore and nobody gives a shit. I can't even go to a fucking mental hospital because they wont accept 16 year olds. Fuck insurance. Fuck life. Fuck everyone. I've dealt with this shit my entire life but people only fucking care when it effects them directly. I tell them I feel like this and they don't fucking help me. I'm supposed to be stoic but I fucking can't. I'm just so God damned tired that I can't stand myself anymore.
556,i don't have any use anymore,"i don't have a degree, i don't have any savings, i'm a burden for my parent, my mum died when i was young doing everything she could to make me happy and i know i'm letting her down by having become this failure i am today. i might only be 21 but i think i've made every wrong step i could possibly take. the only thing people like about me is that i'm too nice, i have no other redeemable character traits whatsoever, and even then no one wants me around. i don't know what's next for me friends, but i feel very close to doing it every single day. i have an easy way out and it's difficult not to take it. i'm sorry i just wanted to put this somewhere."
557,"He broke up a month ago, I can't deal, I want to die","My boyfriend broke up a month ago. He says he loves me but the relationship isn't doing him good.
He was my only true friend. I'm sick of this, I don't feel like going forward anymore. I want him back but I'm not foolish enough to think that it will happen."
558,Can you change your character?,I don’t have a very nice one. I want to change it but it’s proving difficult. They say the truth always comes out in the end as do your true intentions.
559,I just want it to end,"The title is not original in any kind, sorry. Anyway, I wanted to say that I have all planned out. I have only thing missing and it is stopping me. Russian medical care, especially psychology is shit. They keep telling me stories that it will be alright, that It is just a time thing. IT IS NOT. I have been suicidal for more than two or maybe three years. I have it all planned. I want to disappear from my house one day and walk as far as I can possibly can to any forest and shoot myself. But (luckily??) I don't have neither gun nor a bullet to do that, but I think I'll manage that. Every day for me is worse then previous. I am just done. Burned out. I will tell you all how I ended up like this. To be short I was diagnosed with depression since I was 15 and today I am 26. Parents told me to stop lying to them about depression, to stop being lazy. I somehow managed to live to 18 years ( legal age in Russia) and went to psychologist by myself. Shit hit the fan after that. Parents started hating me. I am probably guilty in this situation. Or maybe it's just their Soviet education that made them believe that having a child who has something wrong is death-like. At age around 23-24 I discovered Reddit, r/depression to be accurate. And that sub kept me going due to emotional support of people there. But now, I feel like there is nothing that can support me. All I have is stupid 5/2 9am to 10pm job that I have to go to to keep living in my rented apartment. Huge cigarette addiction and no will left to keep on living this life. Every day is the same for me. home-work-home-sleep-repeat. And all my days off are spent by me sleeping in my bed all day. Thanks to this I have lost my friends. I have no wife/possible GF. My mother has divorced my father and has no intentions of speaking to me. My father has moved ro another city and doesn't want to keep in touch with me. All is lost. thanks for reading and sorry for ranting in your feed."
560,I'm just tired...,"Life has been an opponent in my life. Like being trapped in a caged wrestling arena. I stand and get beaten down and down and down and down until there is nothing but a crater left. I see therapists, I see psychiatrists, but years of abuse and defeat has taken its toll on me. I have no skin to feel only scars that hurt to the touch. The universe itself wants me to fade but somehow despite it's best efforts I'm still standing, standing as if my exsistence is a giant Fuck You to the universe itself. My doctors tell me if I ever think things will get better. Well look at these scars, these scars that will never heal and tell me if my life can get better? Every single piece of happiness and positivity is just a jab at my scars and instead of feeling glee I feel pain. I'm tired, tired of the pain, tired of the scars, tired of where my life has gone. Somedays it feels like the universe itself doesn't want me to exist anymore. I'm tired, tell me when this pain will end."
561,I don't want to die but don't see any other options,"This a horrible place to be mentally. I am in constant, unrelenting despair. I'm 47 years old and have struggled with depression since I was a teenager. My childhood was extremely physically and emotionally abusive. My father is a tyrant who truly does not care if I live or die. My mom has the warmth of an ice cube and loved to beat me with hot wheel tracks. Never once did she tell me she loved me growing up, never hugged me, and tried to discourage and demoralize me at every opportunity. I have siblings but my family of origin is completely dissolved and has been for a long time. No Christmas gatherings, birthdays, etc. I've never been married and don't have any kids, mainly because of depression. 

I am homeless, kind of. I am staying with a lady I used to date. She doesn't charge me rent but I take care of the entire place myself, including all the gardening, cleaning, and dogs. Every single day I make her bed, vacuum, clean her toilet and vanity, etc. I do this to show my gratitude for her letting me stay here and also because I am scared shit less of getting kicked out. I have to make it worth her while. She can be very abusive. She's called me stupid, retarded, said I can't do anything right, and too many other gems to mention. She cooks her dinner, never offering to share of course, and leaves her dishes everywhere, dirty pots and pans for me to clean up. I don't mind because I am not paying rent, but what I do mind is how she humiliates and berates me constantly. Everyone I talk to says she should be paying me for all the work I do. The place is huge and the list of things to do is never ending. She's getting every last ounce of blood out of me, and seems to enjoy it. She's called me ugly, said I have a small dick, and on and on. She has no friends. The words thank you are not in her vocabulary. I keep this place spotless. She will point out one flaw and ignore 99 other things that are right. I could continue on about her cruelty for pages. 

Why do I put up with it? I am trapped because I am sick and have nowhere else to go. She knows this and exploits it. I have no family to fall back on. It is either this or the streets. When I moved in here I was working. I developed a chronic illness and haven't worked in almost a year and a half. The side effects of the medication I need to stay alive are almost worse than the disease itself. It's incurable and progressive. I miss my career dearly. I miss the structure and social aspect of work. I was passionate about my job. Health problems have stolen it from me. My short term disability ends this month. I plan on calling a lawyer about long term disability. It won't be enough to live on but it will be something. 

The bottom line is that I cannot pull my own weight in life. I can't afford to live. Physically I feel like complete, total shit. Getting chores done around the house can be torture due to extreme fatigue, and the cognitive effects of the medications and of the disease itself. I forget where I am and what I am doing. Extreme brainfog. My social circle continually is constricting. I spend most of my time alone. I am too poor and too tired to date. My life is a wreck. I've always felt like an unlovable pile of crap, but now that feelings is magnified. I wouldn't want to date me. 

What about therapy, you may ask. I've spent hundreds if not thousands of hours on the couch. They can't change the facts of my situation. Money is absolutely my biggest source of stress. I I had it, I wouldn't be in this situation. The dogs I take care of are my only family. I love them more than anything and can't imagine leaving them behind. They were severely neglected by the nice lady mentioned above before I got here. I have absolutely dramatically changed their lives for the better. They sleep on my bed. They used to sleep outside regardless of the weather. The only human interaction they had is when someone would feed them. They were trapped in a small area. I changed that. They are all nice dogs but two of them are huge babies. They are always by my side and follow me around. They are really tuned in to my moods. They are my reason for living. All of them are seniors. I am bedridden much of the time and they love to just lie on the bed with me. They do not judge me or accuse me of being lazy. The pain I feel is so extreme and I am tempted to put myself out of my misery but just can't imagine their lives without me. I sob over this. 

Aside from the dogs, I can't see a point in continuing to live. Once they are gone so am I. I've lost my desire to live. I am too sick to support myself. I could be homeless at any minute. The health problem I have is getting worse and will continue to do so, with no cure in sight. It's an absolutely miserable condition to live with. I was a very social person but most of the time I am too sick to do much of anything. The loneliness is physical painful. I don't have children of my own. I have never been close to getting married. I spend holidays alone. I do have friends but on holidays I always feel like an outsider, especially when they start taking trips down memory lane, reminiscing, and breaking out the photo albums. I don't have any childhood photo albums. My mom threw them away. I used to volunteer on some holidays. Not this year. Just keeping up with chores around the house uses up every tiny bit of energy I have. It's actually adrenaline, fear based energy. I work frantically trying to please an unpleasible person for fear of homelessness and losing contact with the dogs. 

I am broke and even if I am able to start working again will never be able to retire. I own nothing. My assets include a tv, laptop, and a box fan. I am unproductive and cost society money. That money could be better spent on younger, healthier people. I am 140k in student loan debt. My credit is shot. Lots of the student loan money was spent trying to figure out what was physically wrong with me and various treatments. This was before Obamacare and the elimination of preexisting conditions as barriers to accessing insurance. I did have some jobs with benefits but my health problems, which include extreme sleep deprivation, caused me to either quit or be fired. Damn it I have tried. I am excluding a lot of factors. From the age of ten onward, I raised myself. I dropped out of high school to work because there was nothing to eat, despite my dad sending child support and alimony. My mom used to leave a 5 dollar bill on the counter for the day's food money. I somehow managed a masters degree. Zero help from family. I was homeless a couple of times as an undergrad. Worked 3 jobs my senior year. Family couldn't be bothered to show up at graduation. 

I wouldn't let an animal suffer like this. I wish euthanasia were available. I am not acutely suicidal nor in any danger of hurting myself, at the moment. I explained why earlier, so please don't tell me to call the suicide number."
562,I just realised how awkward it will be when I have no friends at my funeral.,"So I’m 18 and I’ve never actually had one friend irl, just online. I’m planning my suicide to be for next week. I wonder if my family will wonder where all my friends are? The only people who know I don’t have friends is a sibling and my parents. I honestly think I would only have about 10 people at my funeral, it’s sad."
563,Can someone please help me find a reason to live?,"I hate being one to wallow in self-pity, but I seriously feel like I've had the worst life out of anyone I know. The only thing that makes me want to stay alive at all recently is smoking weed. 

I grew up with a severely abusive mother. I was beaten very badly all throughout my childhood, received death threats, was told horrible things like to kill myself, etc. I developed PTSD when I was 14. In high school, I was rarely hit since I was big enough to fight back, but emotionally still abused. I wasn't popular in school either, I had social anxiety and actually felt suicidal if a friend removed me on social media. I also joined the school newspaper one year and really enjoyed writing but was bullied into quitting by some of the editors there. 

Once I graduated high school, I expected college to be better, but it was worse. My freshman year, I did badly in classes and had a hard time making friends. My sophomore year, I was bullied really badly. I had a big friend group for a while, consisting of the people who lived on my floor, but about halfway through the year, all of them decided they hated me and they bullied me until I was suicidal. This was a year and a half ago, and right now I'm taking time off from college for my mental health and was forced to move back in with the parents who abused me. 

I feel suicidal for a number of reasons. 1. No one loves me or cares about me. 2. I have PTSD that I feel is uncurable, I have flashbacks every day, and it makes me want to die just to make them stop. It's hard for me to be optimistic at all that things will get better. People say that no one should ever kill themselves no matter what, but I seriously can't think of a good reason not to."
564,Is being different bad?,"I was wondering in these days if it's a good thing being different. I personally think it is not, neither Us a good thing being myself. Two months ago I discovered that it's useless trying to be someone else if they know and see you as a shitty nerdy geeky fuck. I hung out with some friends and classmates and got drunk to show them that I'm no different from them and that I deserve the same respect. But the week later it all went back to normal with me being treated like a different, nerdy, retarded person. My therapist thinks it's a good thing that at least they noticed my changing being a more chill person, so they won't attack me like the last year when they threw my head against the wall. But I'm still not normal, I'm still different and it's bad being different, being myself. I need to change a little bit more. What do you guys think?"
565,I’m 14 and depressed but the only person I live with is my schizophrenic mom.,"I don’t know. Everytime I think about me having depression I feel dumb and just assume I’m like every other 14 year old girl. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts since I was 8. My mom is schizophrenic, my grandma has depression. My aunt was bipolar and killed herself. My dad has depression but refuses to admit it. Long story short, it runs in the family. I’ve tried to kill myself before with freaking Advil. Obviously didn’t work. I’ve been to the mental hospital twice. The first was for the whole Advil thing and with my luck I got laughed at by the juvy kids. Second time was by choice because I decided I needed help because I was going to stab myself with a kitchen knife if I went home. I have a therapist but I don’t get anything out of it. I never take off my mask. I’m always “happy” and I act perfect even with my therapist. I don’t fully understand this subreddit but it feels like I’m in the right place. It’s 2am and I’m not okay. My mom had a schizophrenic episode an hour ago and and can’t deal with it. She has been really bad the past few days. And I don’t know what to do. I just live with her so there isn’t anyone else who can help. I don’t want to kill myself because I’m the only reason she doesn’t kill herself."
566,I just want to die but I've taken on too many responsibilities,"not sure if this is even the right sub

i just want to end it all but i can't do that to my parents, my SO relies on me for their mental health, and i recently got a kitten. Strangely enough she reminds me of my childhood cat that passed about a year ago. It feels like a piece of him is in her and i cant let that go. 

i just wish i could slip away or just stop existing"
567,Suicide because of body dysmorhia.,I can't take it anymore. I cry all the time. I am too ugly to please anyone. I don't want to be the second sort in looks. I have a plastic bag and sleeping pills. I will do it now.
568,1 hour till im outta here,"really high on benadryl right now, but not to the point where itll kill me. getting ready to go for a drive. im very numb and tired and i give up. i abused my ex because i have bpd and i didnt mean any of it in the moment or afterwards but i had no control over myself. she broke up with me almost 4 months ago and im still so in love with her. i cant believe i did those things. she told a mutual friend she forgot i existed until i begged to talk to her. she refused obviously. im not even sad anymore, im absolutely empty and ready to go to sleep. didnt know where else to post this because no one in real life cares. ive been promised therapy, people promised they would stay but i have no one because im a mentally ill abusive piece of shit with no future. thats all"
569,Help me do it please,"I've been suicidal for years now, with a few attempts. I wish I had the strength to go through with it till the last moment.
Please PM me if you wanna co-op or just help a brother reach his end by constant motivation.
I know this is a controversial request, but please, I'm desperate. And people who want to save me, stay away."
570,I'm considering suicide for the first time and it's really scary. Help?,"I've never been like this. But now I am, it just appeared out of nowhere and I don't like it. It almost feels like something is tampering with my mind. I don't like this feeling but I can't stop it for some reason. I'm desperate. This just appeared because of stress overload. Yes I'm lonely and  barely have friends. My parents are good but they are the biggest cause of my stress. Oh how much I would love to live far from them, out of stress, yet I can't. My teacher is assuring me that the work I'm looking for will be stressful constantly and I can't bear with that anymore. When I get angry, my mind snaps and I start doing all sorts of crazy shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brain feels like is being covered by something. It feels like a  barrier, it feels aisolated. My brain only thinks about the place where I could easily jump off and kill myself later this morning. I'm getting out of school early today and my mind is just ""switched"" to suicide mode. I just don't care about the world anymore. I just care about jumping from a bridge. Yes, I would hurt some people by doing this, but my mind just don't care about that. It just wants to die or to escape. I try talking to myself out of it. Is in vain, it feels like it rejects me. I just don't care. This is scary. So scary but I can't stop it."
571,Done with it all,"Honestly don’t think I can carry on much more, work sucks, non work live sucks , wish I was in a country where I could get a shotgun and just blow my brains out."
572,I dont know when the last time was.,"This time was mild (thankfully? Not sure yet) just a few, i didn't want to deface my tattoo so maybe adding to it would do.

Just 4 little lines, a deep starting point and shallow as the ivory tip split my skin.

I wasn't intending on leaving, just reminding myself that there's still other things to be felt, ive been on autopilot for so long the mundane just permeated my entire being, now in a blink the the stored pressure releases, sharp and warm the tv static glistens on my arm, the color is quite nice on my tattoo as well hopefully this suffices for the time being."
573,An attempt,"I attempted last night... but couldn’t fully go through with it. Today has been a blur, I’m still reluctant to be alive. Kind of wishing I could do it over and do it right.  Time to numb the pain just a little bit ...."
574,on the bathroom floor,"i've been self harming and crying on and off on my bathroom floor for, i shit you not, 3 hours. i don't want to get up and i want to do something drastic. I'm so sad i don't have proper means butni feel that just means i don't want it bad enough. everything is so terrible and it's not getting better and as a person I'm the biggest burden and can't stop. at 19 there is no hope for me and i'm tired of everyone condescending to me pretending I'm more than I am. almost every time i post no one ever responds. no one listens. i just need someone to talk to. no one ever listens or cares."
575,I just want to die,"Listen, I have attempted suicide 5 times in the last 4 or so years. I seriously just want to die and my parents keep finding me just in time and rushed me to the hospital. I am planning to try again after Christmas but this time I am way more positive and confident it will work. I hope everyone will understand."
576,Should I End It Tonight And Hang Myself In My Closet?,"I'm 26 and I live with my parents because for the last 10 years I did nothing but run around with girls,get high and rob people. So I quit doing all that and came home to get back on my feet. But I just keep drinking and starting fights with my lil brother and my mom.  They want nothing to do with me and they say they're through. Is this worth ending it all?"
577,Relapse,"I just cut myself it’s been a long time, and I’ve never hated myself more and felt more alone. I can’t reach out to my friends or family or bf I don’t want to upset them or think I’m attention seeking. I think I’m just going to down a handful of pills and hope for the best"
578,How do I stop myself,"Between August and November 1345 Henry, Earl of Derby, conducted the whirlwind Gascon campaign of 1345 in Gascony, an English-controlled territory in south west France. The campaign was part of the Hundred Years' War, and Derby, commanding an Anglo-Gascon force, oversaw the first successful land campaign of the war. He twice defeated large French armies in battle, taking many noble and knightly prisoners. They were ransomed by their captors, greatly enriching Derby and his soldiers in the process. Following this campaign, morale and prestige swung England's way in the border region between English-occupied Gascony and French-ruled territory, providing an influx of taxes and recruits for the English armies. As a result, France's ability to raise tax money and troops from the region was much reduced. 
Ralph, Earl of Stafford, sailed for Gascony in February 1345 with an advance force and, following conventional practice, laid siege to two French strongholds. Derby arrived in August and immediately concentrated available Anglo-Gascon forces and headed directly for the largest French force, which was gathering at Bergerac, 60 miles (97 km) east of Bordeaux. Bergerac had good river supply links to Bordeaux and would provide a suitable forward base from which to carry the war to the French. He decisively defeated the French there, before moving to besiege the provincial capital of Périgueux. By this time the French had diverted their main effort to the south west, under the overall command of John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of the French king. Unable to take Périgueux, and threatened by John's much larger force, Derby left garrisons blockading it and withdrew. One garrison, at Auberoche, was besieged by the French. Derby advanced with a small force, launched a surprise attack against the much larger French army and won another decisive victory."
579,No one gives a shit until you admit you want to die,Nobody gives a fuck how much pain you're in or how much you're suffering until you admit that you want to die. If you didn't give a fuck before don't pretend to now. Instead of locking me up like some kind of rabid animal just give me some sodium pentobarbital so I can fucking die.
580,DAE,See those people who has committed suicide on the news in a higher light? There's like this great mystique about them to me.
581,Having a bad month and losing strength,"I have spent many years with suicidal ideation, intrusive thoughts and attempts. 6 years ago I tried for the last time and since then I don't have ideation. I have the odd intrusive thoughts when I'm experiencing stress and can't work out a a solution. I have a system in place when that happens. It usually works and I've been so proud at my progress.

Tonight though I'm at my lowest for a very long time. I'm googling ways to go through with it. I've tried calling helplines but nothing is going to change the things that have made this a bad month. I'm no contact with my family which means no family Christmas. That's good because they create more problems than anything but I still would love that foundation.

2 weeks ago I recalled an instance of childhood sex abuse. I've already dealt with a heap of memories and I'm devastated to know there's more. I can't imagine having these memories come back over the next while as a surprise. I can't be touched and I'm flinching away from people since that memory came back.

My ex finally moved out a few days ago. It's for the best but the house is scary on my own. I was date raped a few years ago and since then I don't go out much and I'm afraid or strangers (ie 2 people are safe but everyone else give me anxiety). 

Another bad thing happened today which took my support animal from me. I feel like that's the last straw. I've got to make statements and stand up to a bully. I've got to print off years of harassment and highlight the incidents and try to make the authorities actually pursue this this time.

I can't sleep, I can't eat, my brain just keeps saying 'I should kill myself' and then flashes of the unrepressed memory or what happened today.

I am in therapy but I don't know if I'll see my therapist before Christmas. I'm trying to let go of the emotions but it just keeps crashing back. I'm swallowing inositol and trying but these thoughts and impulses keep coming back. Can anyone offer a suggestion? Thanks"
582,school is fucking awful and everyone thinks i'm overreacting,"my grades are awful, i get bullied everyday, my friebds ignore me, no one listens

is it because i'm fourteen? is the only reason people refuse to help me because they think i'm faking this?

the only thing keeping me from stabbing myself is my girlfriend, but our relationship is dying out and it's not like anyone would care if we broke up because i'm fourteen

i just want to run away with her. anything for just one break from school

i'm so sick of this"
583,"Another episode, another thought","I've posted here before. I was going through an episode, and now a few months later I'm going through another. I can't fi d happiness, satisfaction etc. People say it's a phase and things get better but it's not a phase and not getting better, only worse. I feel worthless, dead, and I don't even know if suicide is what I want. I just want help. It's all I want, to get better. I just feel like cutting my wrists. Either I die and everything is better, or I survive and everything gets more better. Win win. I won't even know i die when I do. I've cut my wrists so often I grew a high pain tolerance to the point where it's painless. I just think it's better for me"
584,Im so sorry that i am still alive,"Sorry for being living human being that you created. Oh i am not cute kid anymore and take space? Sorry

Oh your precious old furniture is more important than having place for my shirts and shoes

Did you enjoy playing with me like with little kitten? And i was not a burden oh how nice"
585,I ideate about suicide very often. One of my friends just killed herself. I feel like I need to make a video to cope. Is it ok to talk about the ideation and methods or is that accidental encouragement?,"I'm literally the last one anyone would suspect. I'm successful, happy, funny, almost good looking, have a huge friend circle, and love to make others happy. But I'm really fucking depressed and have been for about 5 years now.

A friend of mind just killed herself and it hit like a ton of bricks. I feel like talking about it will help others who don't think it's ok to talk about.  
So I want to talk about my experience with depression, including ideating about suicide, and why I keep going, or what stops me from going through with it each day. Sometimes it's just laziness or apathy. But the thought process, and all the methods I've thought of, are probably graphic, including times I've been really close, but didn't go through with it. 

I've been recently reading that asking people about suicide is helpful to help prevent it. 

I've also been reading that talking about suicidal thoughts, and how common they are, while seen as taboo because people think it will incite the act, is actually healthy and will help prevent it my showing people suffering how common it is. 

But I don't want to just talk in generic terms. I want to talk about my thought process and where I get to a point and stop and don't go through with it. In hopes that maybe it will help others. 

My only fear is giving other people ideas they haven't considered yet. 

So what do you think? Is it ok to talk about?"
586,Songs about Suicide,I feel like I really connect with certain songs about suicide. Gloomy Sunday is probably my favorite.... anyone else have some they like?
587,⭐,"Anything I say will immediately come across as virulent. I've typed up four posts here now I've since deleted and never even sent to begin with because they were all multiple lengthy paragraphs long and left no room for anyone to say anything to me. I covered all of my bases and had full-fledged conversations with myself. However, I'm going to open up my heart to being told something I already know by someone who isn't even taking their own advice. Come at me w/ it. Leggo. I want to die. Convince me that humanity isn't a cruel, sick oppressive institution through and through. You can't. Try to though. LOL. Please... I have a glimmer of hope that I can still make waves to mold the world into a better place and not just waste space leaving my carbon footprint everywhere. I contribute to the problem by simply being alive. How can anyone live with themselves? I certainly can't. BUT...OPEN HEART HERE. TOTALLY. YEP."
588,Lost my only hope with one text.,"Through all my depression and anxiety I held on for one reason. My ex who I stupidly put everything i had into, texted me from military training saying she misses me and if I can pick her up when she comes for Christmas. Long story short I’ve been sending her small messages just cheering her on every now and then. Today I sent her a message saying that if she needs anything once she comes back she can count on me. She told to just stop trying already. Came clean and told her how my lungs are damaged and getting worse, and how in at max in a couple years they’ll be to the point they don’t work and all I want is to give her one last letter and she has now chosen to ignore me. That final blow. Seeing my only hope destroyed in a message. No point in going on. Thank god for the deadly combo of my choice of different pills because I need them tonight."
589,So fucking mad at myself for this,Really sick of feeling like this. I just cried for no reason then had to scream at myself to stop crying while I rode home. I must have looked a mess. I told my friend tonight that I need help and immediately felt horrible for making her worry about me again. I need my friends but I can't keep doing this to them. I'm getting worse and I don't think I can make it till March when a psychiatrist can finally see me. I'm getting desperate.. Crying again fuck.
590,Going to kill myself on the day before my 18th birthday,"Jan 1, 2020. 

I'm going to start next year off with a bang if I continue to feel this suicidal and depressed every fucking day.

not a literal bang, but maybe do something with a word that rhymes with it.

i'm kind of looking forward to it, actually. for the day that i can finally be free.

every day, for the past 5 years, ever since i lost all my friends, i have just felt trapped, like i'm suffocating. like i'm fucking drowning.

my parents used to beat me till i couldn't stop crying, and now they just beat me with their screeching, chalk-like words and by looking at me with those awful, pitying eyes, saying ""oh, what a disappointment."" 

why can't you be a doctor? why can't you be a lawyer? why can't you be just like everybody else? why are you so fucking stupid? why are you such a failure, after everything that we've done for you? why are you so pathetic? why can't you just be what we want you to be? you want to fucking die? after everything we've done for you? you fucker. you bring shame to this family. maybe we should all just go kill ourselves. just stop this fucking nonsense. don't fucking try this ""sadness"" thing with me and just get over it already.

i'm sorry, mom. dad. everything i do, i fucking fail. it's so fucking hard getting out of bed now, so difficult to pay attention, and it's impossible for me to want to live. 

i'm not like how i used to be anymore. i'm no longer smart, athletic, or talented. i'm just a disappointment now. i'm sorry. i wish i was never born. i wish that i didn't exist. i'm sorry for being like this.

haha, you used to be good at math? oh, you were in the exclusive gifted program? what happened? why are you so shit now? haha, failing math now, aren't you! so fucking funny. why are you so fucking pathetic?

stop. please. get out of my head. stop tormenting me. it's been 4 years now, and i've already dropped out. please stop. stop it already. i want to be done with it. i don't want to think about it anymore. i don't want to fucking think about the time i was fucking humiliated and stripped of my sanity. 

everyday, i look at my empty shell of a self and i'm so fucking disgusted that i can't. i'm so ugly, i'm so fucking fat and stupid, and i'm so fucking disgusting that i want to fucking puke. am i an actual person? no wonder everyone fucking glares at me with those fucking eyes. no fucking wonder nobody likes you.

and everything i do, i always fucking fail. i'm always bad at everything. languages? haha, don't be fucking serious, you fucking failed that shit so many times. music? hahha don't even start. running? martial arts? streaming? art? dancing? relationships?? why are you just so fucking bad at everything? why can't you just fucking stick to one thing? and why are you so fucking trash at everything? 

haha, jen was right. you are just a fucking piece of shit, a stupid bitch that deserves to burn in hell. don't you see? she was right, you ARE a dumb bitch who should just kill herself. you really are a piece of trash, a fucking idiot.

i know. maybe you are fucking right. i will fucking kill myself. i know. i know i will.

haha, you had wanted to defend alex, your now deceased friend. and you ended up making all of your best friends fucking hate you in the end because of your stupidity.

you hurt your ex boyfriend and best friend for 5 years after you made him hate you and forced him to let you go.

and now it's happened again.

the one guy who fucking used you, you fucking trusted him and you hurt your friends who fucking trusted you. 

your fucking best friends, ones you would do anything for. why the fuck would you betray them for an asshole who only pretended to love you back?

you fucking dumbass idiot what the fuck is wrong with you? you fucking messed up again like you always fucking do, why don't you just go fucking drown yourself? 

you don't understand. i don't deserve to be friends with anyone. i should have just stayed antisocial, i should have just kept to myself. i'm a fucked up person who doesn't deserve anybody, who just fucking deserves to die. so it's fucking good that they are done with me now, since i'm someone who everyone will hate in the end, someone who doesn't deserve love. it's inevitable. i'm used to it. 

everyone just fucking leaves me in the end. i know it. i fucking know. i fucking know just stop please please please fucking get out of my head please stop it please i don't want to do this anymore please just end it all please for god fucking sake i don't want to breathe this toxic air anymore please just let me go let me go let me go let me go let me go let me go 

please. please, i'm begging you. please end my misery. i don't want to do this anymore. i feel like i'm suffocating and i don't want to deal with this anymore. i'm tired, i'm so fucking tired. i feel depressed every fucking day and i just keep getting thoughts of killing myself and i just feel like drowning. 

i cut myself often and drink often to cope with this fucking pain but i just fucking can't anymore. i'm so fucking tired and i just want it all to fucking end. i'm so sick of it i'm sick of it i'm sick of it please just fucking end

stop giving false hope and making me feel better because in the end i always feel the fucking same and i'm just so fucking tired of it all i just feel like throwing up

my eyes are burning from crying and i'm just so tired

please fucking god just end my misery just let me go

please.. please, i'm begging you.

let me go. let me go. please. please. please..."
591,"""Everything that kills me, makes me feel alive..""",
592,°,"Hey, I don't even know what makes me feel like this, I had a good life, it's just, suicide really seems like the only thing that'll make all these horrible feeling stop, and I know ab the people who love me and all that, that's why I've been fighting against this for almost seven years but... I'm tired, I'm tired you know? I just can't walk anymore being this pathetic bag of failure. 
I quite honestly, hate myself more then anything I've ever hated and to see me dead just seems like such a damn RELIEF from me."
593,I almost got Baker Acted,"I woke up yesterday to my eye irritated, and filled with fluid. It hurt like hell, and I decided I had to go to the ER to get help. I got checked in, and the nurse took me back to get my blood pressure, etc. She asked a few general questions, as per usual. 

Then she asked if I had thoughts of hurting myself. I thought about answering no, because I'm used to dealing with this issue on my own. But I felt compelled to tell the truth, so I said yes. 

Suddenly it was high alert. She began talking to me in a calmer, more soothing voice. She wrote this down on my papers, and she asked me more questions, like if I had a plan, etc. 

All questions were answered truthfully. I told her I didn't have a plan, that it was more of just a thought. She accepted this, and soon I was taken to my room. After getting situated, another nurse came in, and was acting the same way. Calm, soothing tones, asking me questions, confirming what I'd told the other nurse. 

She comforted me, and said a specialist was on her way. The specialist got there, and again, more questioning. She said I was going to be monitored, and that there was a possibility I was going to be Baker Acted. 

This scared me for a few reasons. I've never been baker acted before, and I didn't know what to expect, and I didn't think I was a danger to myself at the moment. I understood, though, that this was just them making sure I was safe. 

After getting blood and urine tests done, another woman came and asked me about my thoughts. Same round of questioning, again. I told her everything, and soon she left. 

I should clarify, that though I have suicidal thoughts, I'm deathly afraid of death. (Pun intended)

It's more of a feeling of not wanting to exist. Not wanting to feel. Just to be numb, and not hurt anymore. I can't, and I won't, take my life. But it doesn't stop me from thinking about it. 

After a long time, the specialist came back and told me my thyroid is ""out of wack"" as she put it. She said this is what could be causing weight gain, as well and mood swings, depression, and my thoughts. She gave me a list of clinics for me to try, and discharged me from the hospital with parting words of encouragement and hope. 

I thought for a while there I was going to regret telling them the truth, but I'm glad I did. I have an appointment tomorrow with a therapist, and hopefully get some medication to balance out my emotions. Wish me luck, guys."
594,Like low key murder me,
595,Conflicted suicidal ideation,So I'm exhausted. I was just recently kicked out of my recovery house because I was having suicidal thoughts. And the recovery house I am in does not deal with that type of mental health. I have been struggling with suicide attempts since I was 8. I would put a rope around my neck for years and years I don't know if my parents ever noticed or just didn't want to notice. I'm very lost. I have been in and out of hospitals for suicide attempts drug induced psychosis and withdrawls. I've been an addict for 11 years and I am 23 now. I have four months clean. The recovery house incident fucked me up bad. I have these thoughts daily and once things get abnormally stressful it goes full blown. It was cause by the fact that I was unable too live up to the standards of the house. I wasnt completwly aware that what I was doing was causing the girls too lose there privaledges. I guess sometimes I'm lazy but the girls began too be pissed off at me. Wouldn't tell me why and if I don't know I'm doing it how the fuck can I change. Anyway that weekend I was under alot of pressure and one of the girls was rotten too me. And by the end of it I just wanted to go out too the barn and hang myself I wanted too open car door and just fall out. When I finally talked about it I was told I was silly for saying I wanted to die over dishes... but they didn't know it was an on going thing. I was told I was doing it for attention or to get out of trouble. I looked up suicidal ideation online and was so depressed and drowned in defeat I didn't even care ort bother too delete it from the history. The director got calls about me all weekend. She kept asking me who I thought I was cause I scared the girls... I got sent too the hospital at the end of it. I don't know anymore why I do this... I can't decipher if it's real or not... if it's just a big game or if I feel like that. I think I do but idk if I am I'm so unaware of myself I hate it so much I need help.
596,A little something I made to cope with my past suicide attempt.,"There was nothing.
Suddenly, in the next moment, something appeared.
What was it?
The fire, the wish to end it all, the desire to consume everything with flames and leave out nothing, again.
There was nothing, again.

That's how my suicide attempt felt for me. I didn't have a plan. I never thought of a faster, quicker, more efficient way to dispose of my mind. I just tried it when the moment called for it.

I failed again. I failed to answer a simple question raised by the teacher again. How could I take it anymore? I couldn't. I rushed out of the classroom, breaking my favorite pen in process, and hid in the restroom. I spent quite some time there, until the class ended. Once I got back something sparked in my head. It was a tiny thought, 'what if I...?'. Nobody would care. Those stupid, ignorant people I study with don't care about me, even after all the bonding together and all the buddy-drinking, all the stuff I made for them because I wanted to be their friend. All in vain. They just didn't care. You can't make someone your friend, they say. They still made those offensive jokes about stuff I've been struggling with, knowingly. They were aware of how much it shucked to be me hearing another round of, 'that's how you really cut', or, better, 'those stupid cutters only do it for attention because they broke up with somebody'. They knew, and they still did. Why have I never saw that before? Why was I so willing to be friends with them? Oh well, that's water under the bridge.

It seems I've lost my train of thought. So, when I got out of the restroom I saw one of the girls I tried making friends with but miserably failed. I attacked her. It was a short outburst of everything culminating inside myself up to this point. I got screamed at, 'are you sick?'. And 'sick' is a lighter way to put it into words. I cried back at them, with some tiny specks of pride, that I was, indeed, sick. Ran into the classroom, began to pack things so I can finally leave this madness behind and... I saw the open window. That's when the ""nothing"" appears. Immediately, everything went silent. There was no sound, no nothing. Only me and the window. It was heaven. It felt so light. Like there was nothing in my life worth worrying about. I was on cloud nine. Then, I was at the window. I felt the cool, autumn breath and I could see as far as I could imagine. This.. Nothingness was magnificent. It was the best feeling or the absence of one in my life. It lasted for a couple of seconds only, although felt more like an hour. It ended with my teacher, grabbing my hand to stop me from jumping. It suddenly pulled me towards life again. And it was disastrous. I cried, and screamed, and shouted, and it was 'everything', it was 'the fire'. The fire that wanted me dead. I was then pulled again my a different teacher into the restroom again, where I continued weeping in an embrion like position. Eventually I stopped, and the fire left. I remember how that teacher walked me all the way to mom's car (who came as soon as she found out about what had happened). I sat there, devoid of any emotion or feeling. I don't remember the rest of that day. That was also 'nothing', but a different type of 'nothing'. The nothing that clothes you in a blanket, shielding you from the outside world, mentally and physically. I couldn't fight it.

That's how it felt for me. Since that time, I haven't had any other suicide attempt, but instead lots of selfharm.

I don't don't why I'm writing this now. I guess it's a weird way to cope. To cope with my increasing depression, to cope with final exams and me being only half-ready. I don't know. It didn't help me."
597,If you need someone to talk to PM me,"I wanted to post this because someone does care, I care. I tried to commit suicide via overdose and guess what? It turns out the human body really doesn't want to die when I comes down to it and it'll fight you every inch of the way. Its painful, it's slow and you'll probably survive with lifelong negative health effects. Since my overdose I've developed several new mental health issues likely due to the extreme stress on my body and brain during that time along with being brutally beaten within two weeks of leaving the phych ward for the second time which led to me having to have surgery. I've had two other attempts since then both with carbon monoxide but something snapped in me last second and I was able to save myself both times, the last time I was close enough to going unconscious that I ended up laying on the ground for several minutes after barely conscious. You want to know what I've learned from all the bad things I've done and had done to me? Reach out to those who want to help, don't beg people who don't care. If anyone wants to talk please PM me."
598,Fuck this stupid life,FUCK EVERYTHING
599,I die on February 5th.,"I'm sorry, family."
600,I hate how emotionless I am,"I don't know what brought this on but, I have never felt emotions for anyone or anything.  
I'm first gen mexican. My parents saw some shit and they where always distant. Which is what I know. Never had an actual relationship with any girl I'm a 25 y/o male btw. I just want to kill myself."
601,Asdf,"Interesting title? There you go.

Maybe I should call the veteran's hotline and press one. I did that before. Why am I an alcoholic? Did the government do something to us, or are veteran suicides a coincidence?

What a waste of time"
602,Get help dying isn't painless and it's not the solution,"I wanted to post this because someone does care, I care. I tried to commit suicide via overdose and guess what? It turns out the human body really doesn't want to die when I comes down to it and it'll fight you every inch of the way. Its painful, it's slow and you'll probably survive with lifelong negative health effects.

603,Why do I try?,"I don't know why I keep trying. no matter how much I beat myself, cut myself, burn myself, starve myself, mistreat myself in any way it's never going to fix anything. no matter how much I cry for help no one will ever notice. no matter how much I hate this prison of a body due to chronic pain it's never going to go away. &amp; no matter how many posts on Reddit it will never take any of this away. I'm doing these things over &amp; over &amp; hoping for a different result. I really am insane. I have no idea why I'm posting this"
604,What kind of medications with alcohol could help to commit suicide?,"I was thinking about taking 3200 mgs of ibuprofen (i heard thats the lethal dosage) followed by drinking excessive amount of vodka. First, I don'r want to spend my last hours in agony, secondly I don't want to drink so much that it makesnme throw up, so I would lose the chance of the medication killing me. Sedative pills or pain killers would be more effective?"
605,Alcohol sadness,Tonight I got another urge to do it. But sadly I didn’t buy enough alcohol. I underestimated it. Next time I will make sure to buy enough. I hate this world.
606,I want it to end,"I wish something would end my life so that i wouldnt have keep on going. I've hit rock bottom after 21 years and now I have no future, and my long term girlfriend passed away two weeks ago. I had everything but my mental health got so bad that I became delusional and ruined so much stuff in my life. I lost everything but I'm too afraid to take my own life. I wish the world would end or something or someone would kill. If I could stop existing, that would be bliss. I just want to be with my soulmate wherever she is now. Life has no meaning anymore."
607,The possibility of committing suicide is bigger than I thought,"I used to think I could never be capable of suicide, no matter how much I suffered. There were too many possibilities and steps I would need to take to even consider it. I feared I would wake up in a hospital and, everyone would know I tried to kill myself. I feared not succeeding and act as if nothing happened. I thought one suicide note wouldn't be enough to explain everything and provide closure for people. So I would write individual ones to the people who need it the most. By my standards, it was more trouble than it was worth. 

  But now, those don't seem to matter anymore. I can't cry on my own so, I write suicide notes to make me cry for a release. I become so overwhelmed by negative thoughts that I would do anything to make them stop. I stopped self-harming for 4 years and, I recently relapsed to lift some of my emotional burdens. Last time I made myself stop on my own but, I don't think I can do that again. My impulsivity is out of control. I constantly have the urge to hurt myself and, in those moments suicide doesn't seem so far out of reach. The thought of not waking up the next day seems like a blessing. I am terrified of myself and what I might do. I am hoping I can get through this again on my own, but I am so exhausted. 

 I know I should talk to someone, but I am ashamed of myself. I don't want anyone in my personal life, knowing how much I am struggling. I guess it is the fear of them seeing me differently or being brushed off for being dramatic. I was in clinical counselling at my university for a few weeks, but that was only supposed to be short term. I'm just trapped."
608,No one cares about me,I’m sick that my entire youth consisted of being sexual abused and mistreated and no one giving a single fuck. People still don’t give a fuck and treat me like trash. I look forward to dying fuck anyone that comes on here to make fun of me.
609,I just want to end it all,"I honestly believe I’m at my breaking point I never had so many breakdowns before I feel truly lonely even with friends or friends I don’t feel like I’m actually living anymore only when I drink or smoke do I feel “alive” but I know that isn’t healthy 

I don’t know my dad and growing up my mother hated me for no reason at all other than being the only boy out of all my siblings this also includes all the abusive shit she did to me 

I have best friends but they don’t know I’m actually like this I sometimes say I wanna kill myself to tell but they always think I’m joking since I usually crack jokes with them

I’ve tried to kill myself at the age of 12 and 14 already and survived both attempts sadly so I decided I’ll just live it out until I get into college and move out, now in a different city and in college but I feel even more distant than ever I’ve tried going out more, hitting the gym and trying to enjoy the “happy” things in life and read books to improve my mindset and Health but I can’t I just think about all the negative shit and dumb living is and how I’m worthless 

I tell myself the 3 deeds have I loved?no have I lived? No do I matter? I guess but not enough to impact someone’s life But I still want to end it 

Today I made a promise to myself that I’ll just end it when I’m 21 :)  if I’m not happy with my life but I believe I won’t even make it till 21

Truly don’t know why I’m writing this other than hoping for an answer when I know there isn’t one out there"
610,My friend killed himself today.,"I never expected this to happen. I talk to him every morning in school, sit with him in my classes, and we have the same lunch together. A part of me still doesn't think it happened. He was 17 years old. I don't know how I'm going to go to school tomorrow and see his empty seat. How can I feel better?"
611,Doing it tonight,It was already enough. It is kinda earlier from my plan but I can't take it. I am gonna take all the pills and wait for my death (I hope).
612,This may sound weird,"Does anyone else keep all their items and belongings in a extremely neat fashion at all times? Just in case you might die that day (by via suicide of course). So that all your items and belongings are already in order and completely organized. For when you are gone....

It got so bad. At one point I stopped sleeping in my own bed, and slept on the floor for weeks. My room was so clean and organized. I wanted it to be spotless, yet still resemble my identity of who I once was while alive. 

I guess that's my way of trying to build closure through the process of grief. If that makes any sense.

Is anyone else like this though? 

It's like you constantly feel your strength or more so TOLERANCE to live slipping through your fingers everyday. So when you finally reach that tipping point. Everything is already in order and in place. 

I have several nooses made by via extension cords ready to go in my closet. And it's so dumb, because you only need one noose to kill yourself. Yet, I have several on standby...

It's just that feeling of knowing things aren't going well, and the thought of not progressing any time soon. Keeps your mind in a constant state of readiness. For when you do kill yourself."
613,Actually planning my attempt this time,"My previous attempts werent carefully planned. This one will be. Everything will be in order. Even though there are occasional good things in life that I enjoy, ultimately I cannot be happy. Everything in my life is great, yet I have never been authentically happy. I just think it's my time to go. I think January 7th will be the day. Hopefully it will be painless."
614,Serenity,"I want to touch the calm with my fingertips.
Feel silence on my face like raindrops.
Inhale serenity. Just today.

Please.

Just today."
615,"It seems that no matter how hard I try, life is never going to get better","I've been stuck in this crap job, have no friends, family.  I've lost passion for everything, no interest in the things I use to like

I know this story has been told so many times but I really feel like I want to just end it all.  

I don't want to...but at this point...it just feels that I can't salvage whats left..."
616,I need advice on my situation,"A while ago a friend confided in me that they wanted to end their life.
I lost my mother to suicide and because of that I panicked and agreed to help in any way I could. They made me promise not to tell their family and I stupidly agreed. I took them to hospital but they wouldn't offer help unless they had actually attempted to take their life which they hadn't at the time. They got appointments with councillors and due to living in a rural village in Washington they had to drive over 2 hours to each appointment but I went with them every time they had one.
Recently their family found out due to seeing scars from self harm and it came out that I knew and didn't say anything.
I feel like the worst person in the world for not saying anything to them. From my perspective they had told me and only me, we were childhood friends and I stupidly thought that because it was only me they told they would try to end their life on the spot if I betrayed their trust. I acted without thinking and I can never take that back, I genuinely felt alone in dealing with it and didn't see that telling the people close to them would help."
617,tired,"I fought so much, tried so many different help but I can't rid of depression. I keep falling and I'm too tired to get back up again. I lost everyone. I'm trash. What's the point"
618,"i have everything i could want, still feels numb. worried about friends and family, when they find me what will they think. only to be forgotten in a week by everyone. i’m scared for hell but what’s better than this though.",
619,No wonder I’m alone,Because I’m annoying and stupid and fucking mean and miserable. I want to see fucking black I don’t want to exist I don’t give a fuck
620,stupid bitch,"I am so fucking stupid and miserable constantly. I am the worst fucking person that’s ever existed I’m so sick of being me. I hate myself. The world would be better off without me. 

I want to self harm again I want to cut to the bone I’m sick of living like this. I don’t want to live being like this. Fuck me fuck this stupid brain. I am so dumb and terrible and worthless and fucking ugly. I fucking hate me"
621,going to give it till after the holidays,apparently i have a fucking eating disorder and they wanna put me in in patient and i swear to fucking god if that even comes close i’m going to end it and i physically can’t allow myself to gain weight but i’ve already ruined everything for myself and my family and my siblings and friends and i’m just another sob story and i’m literally so over  all of it. i don’t wanna ruin anything before the holidays bc were going out of town and holy shit how depressing would that be for everyone.
622,At my wits end,on the verge of giving up
623,I’ve lost all motivation to live,I’ve haven’t had anything particularly painful or traumatic happen to me as of recently. I just no longer feel the desire to live. I have nothing that makes me want to get up in the morning. I feel like I’m never going to truly be happy in my life so there’s no point in really continuing. I debate killing myself for the simple idea that death will be more fulfilling than life.
624,The police aren’t taking the sexual assault I reported recently seriously and I don’t want to be here anymore [20m],"I was assaulted after I came out as gay at a party when I was 14 and despite there being 6 witnesses the police just aren’t doing all that they can. And I just feel so stupid. 

I’m 20 now and I unearthed this repressed memory a few months ago and while I don’t regret reporting it. I just miss not remembering it.

It was my ex friends brother and my connection with this big friend group that I used to love just fell apart and I’ve just grown to hate myself more and more. I don’t want to destroy my family but I’m in so much pain that I don’t know how to keep going.

I’m unlovable and damaged and there just isn’t any room in the world for me I guess. But I feel like too much of a scared little bitch to actually kill my self and it’s the worst.

Sorry for the typos and I’m just sobbing in bed and I don’t have the energy to re read this and edit it."
625,Why am I such a burden,Why can’t I be okay. I hate having constant mental brake downs. I hate that I’m constantly reaching out for help. I’ve even been told I’m a burden. And you know what it’s true. I can’t keep my fucking shit together for more than a day.
626,I don't have a good reason to live,"My wife is divorcing me. I never had much to live for, but I had her. Our marriage has been toxic though. Screaming matches and hurtful words.

So, what do I have to live for now? Nothing really. I'm not interested in life, I'm not looking forward to anything.

I've been in individual therapy for years, I've tried tons of different medications. My wife and I were even in couples therapy until our therapist told us he couldn't help us.

I just don't feel like I belong anywhere. Maybe now's a good time to die."
627,I cant care anymore,"It seems silly, I am writing to a bunch of strangers. They will probably care more than the people in this shithole town I live in. I about to have a birthday in just over a week. Hooray Xmas fricking eve. It's a milestone too.
I get ignored. My own husband has never even made a cake for my birthday in the 20 years we have been together. He forgets or will not be able to. One year I got my birthday cake in August. Yeah. Really cool. 
/sarcasm 
I am his full time caregiver and that has stopped the want for a bit thinking ""He wont be able to care for himself. But that doesn't even work anymore. 
My mother is a crazy narcissist bitch that I would rather have 1000 paper cuts and swim in a vat of rubbing alcohol rather than have her in my life. My father doesn't give two shits about me. On Thanksgiving I called him and he said he would call back (still waiting)
When I was 16 I took a 3 month supply of Canax to try to end it. I was found in time but the first think my mother said was ""You are useless. You cant even kill yourself right""  it stings and it still hurts over 20 years later. 
I have already emailed my husband a locked file with a password he would know, all the passwords and user names to bank accounts, bill accounts etc. Slowly over the past month I have been changing things to his name so he doesn't have the headache of fighting with the electric company etc.
Even a charity group I am in will just say ""That sucks"" and have a memorial service in May as they do with all members. I can already hear one woman say how selfish I am, another making it about her. I will get a quick ""Sweet in our memory"" then that's it. 
My own sister wont care. I talk to her almost daily lately but she has been all about her trouble and none of mine. I truly feel my Memorial service will be empty. I cant get someone to come to a party let alone anything else. 

I know even my reddit gift exchange will suck this year. My giftee got theirs and loved everything. In past years I get sadly bad exchanges. (Once had to be regifted twice)

I feel like no one will care. My cats will miss me, but they will have husband and get over it in time. 
Thanks for letting me rant one last time. Good night all."
628,"that feeling that you wish you didn't let someone into your life, so it's making it hard for you to leave","I'm being a burden on everyone in my family and my girlfriend. They know what I'm going through, but I wish they didn't. I don't want to give them any more trouble. I'm just dragging all of them down now a brighter future"
629,To This Day,https://youtu.be/ltun92DfnPY
630,I feel so exhausted.,"I feel so tired. Life is just physically and mentally exhausting at this point. I just want to die already so I don’t feel this boring, empty, tiredness that won’t go away. I feel fake. Nothing feels real anymore. Everything feels like a simulation, like an illusion. I am so tired from life itself. Life just drained every bit of emotion and feeling out of me at this point. School is exhausting, going home is exhausting. Almost everybody is just so annoying, especially at my school. It’s hard to even survive a day at school. Everyone there is so annoying, and won’t leave me alone. My parents are also annoying as shit. They wonder why I don’t even want to talk to them when they’re so fucking annoying. All my anger towards the world itself, coupled with the monotonous, and boring school and home life, just made me want to end it. I am just so tired, lonely. I want peace. I hope I am killed or I am able to find a way to kill myself because I don’t know how to go on at this point."
631,Anyone stopped going to class or work because the end is near?,Missed lots of University classes. Mid exam will start this Thursday but I studied almost nothing. Confident in ending it on Wednesday night.
632,Hey guys,"I need to talk to someone, I need to explain my situation and I need guidance from someone. I’m never actually going to kill myself but the amount of suicidal thoughts I get is troubling me and I’m not in a good mental place right now."
633,I want to shoot myself because I deserve it.,"I’m 27, live with my parents, and work in a sweat shop. I have achieved nothing in life. I used to love drawing, but for years it’s pained me to even pick up a pencil. 

All I can bring myself to do is watch porn and play games. I have several imaginary girlfriends who I fantasize extensively about before drifting off to sleep at night. In fact I more or less exist in my daydreams. I can’t stand to live in this world anymore. I’ve grown to hate people so much. Everyone has a right to think I’m a complete asshole, because I just stopped caring how people see me a long time ago. 

There were hours from today that are just a complete blur because I was thinking so intently on killing myself. I’m more ready than I ever have been to blow my brains out."
634,Very tired of my life right now,Recently just got a job that I’ve been trying so hard to get. My parents never cared and believed it was really easy to get and give me the usual “as you should” speech. I never go home from college anymore. My mom has caused me so much pain that I want to end it all so she can understand what she has done to me. I want her to feel the pain and torment I’m going through everyday.
635,im so fucking tired,"I'm tired of being a horrible mom. I'm tired of hating myself every single morning. I'm tired of BEING TIRED. I just want peace, I want my kids to know that I love them and that the world has a lot to offer but their mom just couldn't deal with it. I want out, I give up, I'm done. I pray they're stronger than me."
636,it hurts so much sometimes.,"sometimes when i sit in class the urge hits me really really hard but i can't show it. i want to scream and hurt myself and end it all but i can't. it hurts so much, man."
637,Wanna die but can’t leave my cat behind,Every time i think about ending it all i remember my cat and how he’d be alone and not know where i went or what happened and THAT kills me inside. Lmao if only i wasn’t such a sensitive bitch i could just do it
638,It feel like the universe is telling me to kill myself.,"I am broken I'm more ways than I can count. Every aspect of myself feels sick and wrong. Most of the entire world would rather see me dead and maybe it's a sign to finally do it.

First off in a leftist so the half the population hates me where I live. The world is progressively getting worse and its hurt to want to slight further into right wing extremism.

I'm both Bi and Trans. So even more people think I shouldnt exist. I am trapped in a flesh prison doom tonlook like some unpassing and disgusting creature for the rest of my life. I can barely look at myself in the mirror without wanting to throw up.

I have sever depression that hasn't let up in years. I havent been diagnosed but I likely have both OCD and Naxiety. So every day is filled with self hatred and worry. Performing patterns that make me want tear my own hair out.

Lastly I have a Paraphilia. I am attracted to normal things but I also have these horrible unwanted attractions. They would be illegal, but most of all harmful and extremely immortal to act upon. So I would never do it. I would sooner shoot myself than act on it. But it doesnt matter. I am disgusting no matter what I do and most people would agree. 

Life doesn't feel worth living. There isn't a simple person in the real world I could ever be completely honest with. I can do every single thing right and I'm still fucked.

So what's the point of living a life that can never get better? Where I can never be happy. I'm so broken and I just want to stop fighting and die."
639,I’m done,I can find the will to live any more it takes so much to actually pretend to be happy nothing makes me happy I can’t feel joy or love just pain and self hatred I can’t keep acting like I’m getting better nothing makes me feel nice pills therapy and I’m dating someone and I just feel like I’m attuning them along I had feelings for them they got to close and I want to get rid of them becuase I will hurt them and they keep saying I won’t but I will and I know I will and I can’t get the thought of committing suicide out of my mind I’ve tried ODing 4 times and if I could swallow pills I would try again at this point I can’t live I just go along with what the world says for me to do I don’t want to live I don’t want help I want to just be normal but death let’s me be normal
640,I'm a Worthless Bastard,"Today, I really contemplated killing myself. It’s not the first time. I’ve considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. I’d miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didn’t want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasn’t everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.

It wasn’t until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didn’t take her son to school today. He didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father's side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldn’t be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how I’d never finished school, how I didn’t have a job, how I didn’t have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.

A worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.

She's right. I don't have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don't have a degree. I'm 23 and still a virgin. I've never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I'm so tired of getting rejected.

I just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I'm being irrational. It's just how I feel so I haven't left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don't get out of the car that way I don't have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.

I used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and I’d tell anyone who would listen about my plans.

I endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didn’t have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn't do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I'd cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldn’t I take a joke?  I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didn’t. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, “Not yet. I can’t do that to my family.”

But I think about it now that I’m older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, ""Look after both of them.""

Now, I'm nothing. I didn't become anything. I didn't prove anyone wrong. I can't take care of anyone. I'm a waste of space. A worthless Bastard just like she said. I feel so worthless and tired. I hate myself so much. I just wish I was dead."
641,I don't want to tell anyone and I wont,"No one, no counsellors or anyone of the sort will help me. I've tried, at this point I've given up seeking help, I guess this is my last stab. Suicide is always in my mind, like always and it never goes away. It's eating away at me, and even though I tried to kill myself quite a few times and failed, I'm just so tired and exhausted and I don't want to spread that to others around me because I've seen what that does and how everyone goes away l"
642,Might have lost everything...,"My life sucks, I have failed college, I quit the sport I loved because I was bad at it, and all I have done to my life so far was playing videogames... I have 6k hours just on steam alone (spent a lot in non steam games as well), And im just 20... Finnaly found love, found that she liked me as well, I couldn't belive when that was happening  to me.... But I might have ruined everything because im an idiot... I don't know how to talk to people... I did not insult her or anything but I've hurt her many times mostly because I always hide stuff from her because im afraid to her but then I end up telling everything I feel and it hurts even more I guess... All I want in life is to be with someone and I think I might have lost her tonight... I have seen this happening to by Godfather... He wakes up with a cigarrete in one hand and a beer on another... I'd rather die than live the whole life alone with minimum wage job..."
643,"You know whats great, being drunk.","Perhaps you should try it lol. I think I'm on my fourth malt, and I've basically been chuging them...starting my fifth i think. Anyone want to talk about how everything sucks..."
644,Breakdowns and stimming,"I found out my mom is still using, addiction is a disease. She just lies and lies and lies. I'm not even allowed to be angry because then my grandpa scolds me.

I usually don't have breakdowns but everything was loud and so much and I was thinking and my mind was so fast. Once I started crying and hyperventilating, I started thinking even more. I thought about my life and my friends and the future and my ex and my worth.

And then all the suicidal thoughts flooded my mind, I wanna be shot, I want to be stabbed in the head, I wanna swallow pills, I want to die. I started pulling my hair, pulling and pulling, and I wanted to scream. I stayed silent the entire time. I want to die. I want to die so badly. I felt the urge so badly, I got my pills out and I don't know how I turned that around. I didn't take them, but things might change.

All my senses were flooded and there were just so many thoughts running through my mind. I hate everything and want all my friends gone, they all make me worried and anxious and scared. I don't know what people think and it makes me terrified. I don't know how to fix myself, I want so badly to be normal. But I can't be normal, it's not fucking possible. I feel like the only solution is suicide. And I know I can do things, but how long will I have to feel so absolutely miserable? It's so unfair and I can't stand this loneliness.

If I killed myself, my family may hurt, but that won't be my problem once I'm gone, they can go absolutely ape shit if they want. I should feel bad, I do, but wow do I want to die."
645,"I'm sorry if you read this, but I need to get this off my chest.","I am so tired of my stupid brain. Sorry if this is incomprehensible and confusing, I just need to get this off my chest, I'm not looking anything, I just need to expel the bottled up crap inside me. I was always a quiet and shy kid at school, but I was always told that I need to start to become more sociable and make more friends, be more like your brother with his ability to be social. So I started to mimic my elder brother when I was in elementary school (around grade 2). But because he was 7 years older than I, I was still different. So I started to mimic the people around me. My speech and personallity would change with who I was with, my brothers friends, my classmates, nerds, athletes, etc. And I started to be more social. So much that I was known my most people in my school when I graduate. But I never let anyone really get close to me because I was to scared to show my real feeling and show that I'm just a fake. But now I'm a second year at University and I don't even know my real personally anymore. I feel hollow and all I do is struggle with the depression from so many things (it started when I was in 3rd grade after something and that is when I started to contemplate suiside too). And my mind just will not stop hurting me. ""You're not being a real person, you can't even stop changing personalitys when you're talking to yourself, all you do is hurt the people close to you, you can't ever save the people close to you from getting hurt, so why are you even here then to be a waste of money? Why don't you kill yourself so you're not hurting any else?"" I just wish I could stop it stop my head, stop the change in personally that now just automatically change when not even thinking or talking to someone. It just does it at random, so I can be calm one second and suffering from a panic attack the next. I just wish I could go away so I don't hurt anyone else with my stupid brain. Deep down inside I know it's right though, and deep down I feel that anything bad that happens is my fault or something that I could have stopped, I really believe that, which is another reason why I hate my brain because it tortures me with reliving everything that happened to people close to me. And college isn't helping anything either, I can barely do homework without freaking out, let alone tests, and I can't sleep because I panic about school and my mind tortures me with thoughts of my uselessness and pain I being you people. I have expressed my feeling to one person before and they couldn't really take it and they betrayed me by telling my family, I didnt want them to know. Now they act so differnet around me. I didn't want sympathy, all I wanted was to get stuff off my chest to my best friend and her to stand by me. But she just betrayed me. So I really don't trust anyone with my thoughs anymore. But I am feeling so completely hollow and kinda just tired. I'm sorry that this was so long and stupid. I'm sorry that I have now burdened you with this. Please for me to help, don't remember me, I will feel even more crappy if I know that you are worried about me on top of your problems, which was another reason why didn't want my parents to know. That makes me feel terrible but I feel that if I don't get this off my chest I might do it so I am not a pain or burden to anyone else. I'm sorry for rambling. I'm really sorry. I hope that you have a good night and sorry again if you read this stupid pathetic, weird, and stupid post. I just wish I could be gone. Everyone would be better off because all I do is hurt them or can't help them."
646,Tired of Fighting,"I feel like my entire life has been one huge fight. I'm always treading water, but just enough to barely survive drowing. Poor childhood, dysfunctional, barely there parents, teenage years full of struggle...and it just merged in to this adult hood full of difficulties. 

In 2013 I was convicted of a crime I did not commit and sentenced to 8.5 years in prison. After serving 2 years, I was released. I came out strong...ready to succeed  and destined to prove to everyone that I was a force to be reckoned with. In under a year and through my own will and perseverence, I built up a successful bakery. I was featured in our state tourism magazines, was doing interviews on local media sources...and then it all came crashing down around me. Someone discovered I was a felon and started an online hate-fest.  It was endless- 3am phone calls, Facebook messages, death threats. It didn't matter that I was innocent. It didn't matter that I was a community advocate.  It didn't matter that all I did was give back. 

I struggled. I faltered. Business briefly took a hit, but I dug deep and pushed on. I had lost investors and monetary support...but I refused to give up, despite the emotional upheavel. Business carried on, but never quite as well. Never without someone continually bringing up the past when someone posted an online referral. 

In early 2019, I made a business shift. The next town over had a perfect opportunity and I took a leap of faith. I purchased the building, through owner financing with an agressive mortgage  relocated the bakery, and also opened a Café, antique store, and event hall. Business was booming, reviews were calling me the towns newest rising star. 2 months later, my husband encountered an issue with his construction company and is now completing a job without pay. I'm now covering the expenses of his business, our personal bills, our rental properties (which are now
 vacant and non income earning because he cant seem to find the time to fix them nor can I find the extra money for us to make repairs) and the new business. Expansion ideas were put on hold, and I was left to carry the bag once again. 

2.5months ago I started to barely tread water; I feel like I'm on the brink of drowning. I work 16-20 hour days and seldom take a day off. I keep booking catering jobs and custom orders, because we are so financially strapped. My husband still isn't bringing in an income, but I have to hear him criticize me at every turn. In one breath he's telling me how awesome I am, and in the next it's my fault because I wanted this business. He barely works 8 hour days. I don't understand why he doesn't work harder so this contract can be complete. I don't understand why he won't find a part time job. I don't understand why he just won't help me.

I try so hard to be the kind of person this world needs- kind, giving, respectful. I do my best to bring laughter and happiness to others, even though inside I just want to cry. Everything is so dark, but I keep wanting to be someone else's light.  But you know...I just cannot do it anymore. I'm crashing. Living life hurts.



I can no longer keep up with the bills, the stress, and the expectations. Today they turned off the electric at my shop because everything my husband has his hands in is more important. How do I deal with this?! I cannot take out a loan,  I don't know anyone I can ask for help, the amount owed is too large for me to pawn something... I have reached the point of broken that I cannot fix. This is our only source of income. I have 5 members of my staff that rely on me so they can feed their families. I am such a fu (*ING failure. I can't fix this. I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do.

I'm so tired. Tired of fighting, tired of believing, tired of living. 

I keep thinking about how easy it would be to just hit the gas and collide with a tree, a cement pillar, or just veer off the bridge in my vehicle. I think about putting a gun to my head. I think about what pills I could take to go to sleep and never wake up. 

I don't know how to keep going anymore. Being strong is exhausting. Fighting is exhausting. I'm lost, I'm broken, and God has no interest in hearing me beg for help.

And yet, I'm still too chicken to do anything to myself. For now,"
647,Is there an easy painless way to die,
648,I don't understand the world,"Everything is so loud and confusing. I don't understand people and conversations, I wish I knew what people think. I am paranoid and think so much about things that don't matter. People scare me, I don't know what anyone thinks and I hate it.

I can't process that world correctly, I don't know why. It's making things so difficult. I start obsessing over what things mean and then I'm having a panic attack and pulling my hair. I just want to understand."
649,Long term plan (20F),"Nothing urgent or special but I just felt like ranting on reddit to strangers again. I'm just bored, tired, desperate, in a lot of pain, you know, the typical stuff, trying to distract myself from taking more phenibut (you can do it!!! no phenibut for tonight, no more, wait till the middle of the week or at least tomorrow, you got this!! lmao) . I can't see myself living past my 40s, even if things do get better I wouldn't mind dying, I've lived long enough, way longer than I thought I would, I'm even content with where I'm at right now, I have no real direction/passion in life at this point. In my teenage years I couldn't even see myself living past 18, that soon became 19, then 20. At some point around senior year of high school I realized what a waste it would be if I can't finish college and get a job and take care of my parents (who deserves so much better and invested everything into my education). I am also doing really well at school right now, like surprisingly well, despite all the crap that's always in my head 24/7. Of course there are still things I wanted to do/try, like modeling or developing a game, but they're not my priorities and I would be fine without them. I lost my passion for piano and visual arts, everything I do just feels empty. I'm just going to give the last 20 years of my life one last push, if that makes sense. Make a lot of money, die pretty, maybe with an exit bag. Make sure that the money I've made is enough to feed and care for my parents and loved ones for the rest of their lives.  Climb the corporate ladder if I have to, suck my boss's dick maybe for that promotion, get a sugar daddy, I don't know, maybe even deal drugs or go for prostitution but that's a little too unstable. Of course it is still selfish of me to leave them behind like that, and I'm sure they'd be devastated, but hey, never asked to be born! I'm just in a lot of pain, all the time, my whole life. Of course there were moments where I was genuinely happy, and I do see the beauty in living and being alive and sniffing flowers and all that but death is liberating and living is overrated."
650,overdose question,"if I take around 60 of the 25mg Topiramate, 30 of 25mg Lamotrigine and whatever else I have laying around the house, and then hang myself, will I die? Because I can't go back to the psych ward. I dont have insurance, and I definitely can't afford the psych bill if I do surivive."
651,16 pregnant gf ending my life is the only way out,I’m 16 and my girlfriend is pregnant my parents already don’t rly like her and they don’t know yet and her dad will kill me anyway I can do two things kill myself and never have to deal with the ebresment and torture and let my offspring live on or I can take responsibility idk eny more. I had so many big plans in my future and it’s all gone in the trash now and nothing feels worth it anymore I’m in so mutch pain help  pleas
652,i’m in such horrible pain,i don’t think it will ever go away. i’ve got no chance at all at having a happy future since im extremely mentally ill and stupid and have dropped out of high school. i can’t and won’t let anyone get close to me anymore after being betrayed too many times. nothing fills the painful empty feeling i always feel in my chest. nobody really likes me. i’m pathetic and tragic and will inevitably kill myself
653,I don't want to die but I just don't want to do anything...,"I would rather continue to be alive, but I don't want to do anything. The few times I want to do something I wish I had some kind of force field that prevented other humans from being within a mile of me so I don't have to deal with people in public or family members who expect shit of me.

Anyone else?"
654,I have a plan,"but not a date set yet, I'm going to give life one last chance and give it till the new year to see if things start looking up, It's nigh impossible to get a gun legally in my country unless you order one online, so when I finally have enough I'm gonna take myself to my local gun range, put a gun square between my eyes and go quick and painless, I just can't do it anymore, I've lost the one person I've been terrified to lose due to my own insecurity, my reputations in shambles and no matter what I try everything I do just feels like killing time till I die anyways, hell, half the time I'm so numb my body doesn't even feel like it's there, it just feels like I'm a pair of eyes floating through a simulation full of randoms who don't even notice me, real life just doesn't feel real to me even when I'm completely in the moment and I just don't know how much more of it I can take, I'm just ready to end myself already"
655,"If I have herpes, I’m probably going to commit suicide","Earlier this year I had sex with someone from Bumble after a bad break-up with my ex boyfriend. He insisted we have sex in the dark which I didn’t think much of at the time; some people are nervous and prefer it in the dark the first time. Afterwards, it became apparent that he had genital warts and herpes. He was horrible to me when I questioned him about it. I can’t call it rape because he never forced me to have sex with him or anything, but I never would’ve consented to sex with him had I known. I hate the fact that he didn’t just not tell me; he actively deceived me by trying to hide the symptoms he had on his junk. 

I was diagnosed with genital warts and it’s been hard but I’ve been managing. They usually go away by themselves and you’re no longer contagious so that’s been keeping me going. But then I went to the clinic because I had a rash and the nurse noticed some sores down there and told me she thinks I have herpes. She swabbed it and then I went to a second nurse and she swabbed it too. I should get the results this Wednesday or so. But I’m expecting it to be positive. 

These past few days have been some of the worst of my life. It’s always been my dream to fall in love and get married. Yet if I have herpes, that may never happen. My mum told me that realistically no-one will want to date me with herpes and I’ve read lots of messages on social media sites to the same effect.

If my test comes back positive, I will probably commit suicide. I’ve had some mental health issues in the past (I had trouble making friends at school etc.) but I’ve always thought, ‘Hang in there, it can get better!’ and it has. But herpes is different. It’s for life and my dating life will never get any easier. I really can’t see any way out.

It feels like such a waste. I went to Cambridge University, I have an amazing high-paying job lined up as a lawyer. I love the hills and the sky, I love reading and playing video games, I love being with my friends and having dinners out. I love life. But for me, having a relationship is so essential. A life without ever being able to cuddle someone, to share my life with is just not worth living. What makes it worse is seeing all those other people - even fictional characters in books and movies - having happy relationships and knowing I might never have that.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my self-indulgent rant. I have a diary I write in but it feels cathartic being able to tell other people. I can’t tell anyone in real life, obviously, because of how awful and embarrassing it is. I have the method all planned out and I will get the materials this week if necessary."
656,I almost died because i hanged myself then didn't succeed because i'm heavy...,"I considered suicide weeks ago by stabbing myself, i was on my bathroom for an hour crying but didn't end up doing it because of religious beliefs.

I hanged myself last night i almost succeeded it was painful and i immediately lost conscious...  The pressure on my neck it was painful really painful...

The rope tore then i fell, i felt like i was dead for 0.5 seconds... I cried so much, i want to call the suicide hotline but my last conversation was not a good one.

My neck still hurts, but i just want this to end... I feel worthless and nothing."
657,Fuck life,"I can’t go through one more day of life. 
I’m the cause of my families dysfunction. I threatened suicide of my exboyfriend because I didn’t know how to handle my first break up and now my ex-boyfriends sister is claiming I’m a creep because he was 13 and I was 17 when we dated even though my parents told me it was fine to date a 13 year old at 17 his parents were okay with it and my psychologist said it was fine but now that we’ve broken up his sister is spreading rumours about me being some kind of paedophile which I already have to go through in my life because you see I have POCD Which is OCD that tries to convince you you’re a paedophile and if anyone starts believing these false lies about me I will end it there’s nothing you can do to convince me otherwise. His sister just doesn’t understand the circumstances I’m on the autism spectrum so all the kids my age see me as a special needs kid so none of them to go out with me all my friends are younger than me because I’m mentally younger and all I want is love so of course when my 13-year-old friend admitted he liked me I just couldn’t say no but now people think I’m a creep and my ex just hates me I should just kill myself right now"
658,Can’t connect with anyone,"Why am I so different? It feels like no one wants to be around me or talk to me. Am I ugly? Do I just seem like a bad person to be around?

Reaching the goals I set for myself is so meaningless. I don’t get any happiness from it. I need people who care about me and understand me in person."
659,my suicide letter,"  

Mom,

I’m sorry. I always knew I was goignto kill myself. It had to be me. Whenevet you asked me what was wrong I knew you didn’t really care or had the ability to listen to me because of how you treated me when I was alive. I was only alive because I never had a choice to start with. I was never going to be good enough for anyone, not you, not dad, not P, nor anyone. You never asked because you cared but because you thought that was what you were supposed to do. But I’m tired of everyone treating me like I was always going to be there, with as little effort as you could give. You told me that I better not be like \[REDACTED\] because apparently uou never knew you had a lesbian for a daughter, except for \[REDACTED\]. But at least you have a granddaughter. Who cares about the actual living daughter you had. You don’t need me. No one needs me. Do not resusistate me. I don’t want to live as a vegetable. I chose this. Unlike eveyrhint else, I chose this, for me. Beause theres no point any more. I tried to be everything everyone needed from me, and that’s all I could do. No one could be what I needed. Not even you, mom.

Love always and forever,

\[REDACTED\]"
660,I think I going to kill myself,I just give up I have nothing and no one to live for probably be dead in a few hours
661,What do you think?,"I just realized how much the social media is manipulating us, every move they do, every word they say, for me it's just lying, lying for money and fame. I see a lot of fake it till you make it. I don't know If I do like Pepsi when I'm shopping or if I just saw a commercial of it or a picture on Instagram someone drinking it.

How much of myself am I ?

Before this Realisation I felt like I wanna die every second, now I feel like the world is all about breaking the circle and somehow I feel hyped to do this, but I'm scared Ill not have this power tomorrow to do this.

I hope someone can give me a opinion on this
Feel really sorry for the English, I hope someone managed to read it

And yea maybe this is common knowledgeable, I did not know it. For me it's maybe a new beginning"
662,Life,"Life just seems to drag along, and no matter what I do, say or think, life will continue on with or without me, ans my insignificant existence will not matter. I've kind of given up on hiding the fact I want to die if I am around anybody. Working retail doesn't help, school doesn't help, even my closest friends, my family, and my girlfriend don't seem to help me. Maybe one day I will no longer feel this way, but I don't know if I will be around to see that day, or if I want to even make the journey to that brighter future."
663,I’m not living.,"I’m not even living anymore, I don’t even live my life anymore; I’m just kind of drifting through existence. I’ve come to realize I’m not a very happy person, not at all anymore. It really has all just started to lose meaning recently, if I’m going to be blunt. I have constant suicidal thoughts pent up in my head. However, at the same time, I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die, I really don’t, but sometimes it just feels like it’s not even worth it, I don’t feel alive anymore. I hate mostly everything that encompasses my life, this is pretty selfish because I don’t actually have it too bad off. I mean, some people literally have one meal a day, yet I still feel so much more sorrowful compared to them. I’m not living, I’m just existing. I really am losing touch with myself, I don’t really know what to do anymore. How to hide away these emotions that constantly clog my brain on a daily basis. I don’t want to be awake, but then I also don’t want to be asleep constantly. I don’t want to be around people, but I also am fearful of being alone. I just can’t decide anymore, I really don’t know who I am anymore. I want to stop existing, but then I’d have to die in order to do that, and I don’t really want to do that either."
664,"I need advice after my roommate's (maybe?) attempt (tw cutting, blood)","Hi, I don't know if this is the right subreddit but it's the closest I found.
My roommate maybe attempted suicide yesterday? I'm not sure about the details and I'm kind of too scared to ask. A mutual friend told me they're in the hospital and okay, but had asked me to feed their hamster while they're gone.

So their hamster lives in their room, so on my way to feed her I came across the remains of the ordeal - a blade in some blood. Basically, I don't know whether to clean it or leave it untouched.
I feel that if I leave it, it could be traumatizing/triggering for them to see again, but cleaning it might be an invasion of privacy or too...like, intimate?

Anybody have any ideas?"
665,I don't feel wanted or that I fit in anywhere," First time I've done this, guess I should say a little bit about myself. I'm 19 (M) and I'm in college right now. I was born with Aspergers syndrome and I haven't been able to see my therapist for months at this point. I don't feel like there's any groups on campus that would like me. I'm not very well liked in most of my classes. I feel alone and used at work (a shitty dish cleaning job that I only have because it fits with my schedule). I went to our Christmas party yesterday and it was super awkward, I talked to basically just one person for two hours and ended up annoying them. I go to the gym nearly every day but I just feel like I shouldn't be there. Every online forum or friend online I have I eventually either annoy, get blocked by, or end up driving them away. I spend most of my time when I'm not studying, working out, or cleaning dishes on my PC. I'm somewhat paranoid and I have a painfully short ability to wait or be patient.

Every sports team I've been on I just end up being mostly forgettable and mediocre. I can't name a single location I can go to other than my own room where I feel normal. I am on bad terms with half my family, the other half being all over the country.

Most of my friends have moved out of state or are so busy I barely get to see them. Whenever I make new friends I rarely try to keep up with them, yet I know I should. On the rare occasion I do, they never respond to me.

I haven't been in a serious relationship in about 3 years. I have been dumped or rejected by every single person I've fallen in love with since then. I cannot remember the last time I got a hug from someone that wasn't my Dad.

The only person in my life I feel truly valued by is my father, who spends mountains of cash on my tuition and therapy. I often talk to him about problems he says he wishes he could answer but he cannot. He is quite old now and I don't know how much longer he will be here. I can see the pain I put him through and it makes me feel ashamed of myself.

I don't feel welcome anywhere and I dont know what to do."
666,I feel so lost without the hope of suicide...,
667,hi i need urgent help,"i mixed salt and hand sanitizer to overdose from alcohol poisoning because it was all i can find, my mom threw it away and yelled at me. i’m desperate. what do i do"
668,Venting,"Someone gave me contact info for a counselor who I'll see in a week. This will be my first time ever doing something like this. Idk what to expect.  I also dont know if I can make it that long. 

The past few days have been crazy. I'm venting here because I need to write about it but I cant write to anyone I actually know. 

I've had suicidal phases come and go my entire life. But this is something new. It feels so real and so unreal at the same time. Twice this weekend I was extremely close to ending it. I was able to stop myself, obviously. In the moment it felt like the literal only thing I could do was end my life. The first time that I came close was Friday night. I am not an angry person but all of this anger came from nowhere. I felt so violent and it was overwhelming. And even a little scary. The second time, I was just almost in a fog. I walked to the edge of a really long pier where people take boats out and was there for a long time, ready to jump in. 

When I'm in the moment it feels so unavoidable. I dont know how I didn't do it. But when I'm out of that moment - it feels like it was exaggerated, like I made up those feelings, like I wasnt *really* as close to killing myself as it felt. 

And I dont feel like I can make it through the week. Even though I have some good moments each day, on the whole every day feels darker than the day before it. 

I'm really trying but sometimes I dont even know if I want to feel better - or if I can. Just waiting for something to push me over the edge."
669,Lately I can’t find happiness in anything,
670,Journal Entry December 13th 2019,"Ive been having so many dark thoughts recently i dont know what to do anymore. I will cry randomly throughout the day hoping that something bad will happen to me so i dont have to feel this way anymore. When im with other people i dont feel this way, but once im alone with nobody to distract my mind it lingers around as an option. Perhaps the pain meds are only a short term solution and just made everything worse, or maybe they are the only thing that has kept me alive until now? Sometimes i just hope for a freak accident to happen to me because its better then ending it myself because everyone will question why i did what i did. The burden that would fall upon my family is too much and i can't do that to them. But every day I think about doing it more and more. I dont know how to approach my family about anything because I dont want to inflict mental anguish on them or make them think they did something wrong. Thats simply not the case, as all this has been because of my indecisiveness and lack of purpose in this world.

Thanks for listening, sorry if its not stuctured well. That was the least of my concerns while writing this.

PS: Im not going to go through with anything, but some advice would be nice..."
671,No one cares about me and I should just kill myself. Just know that I’m going out with a bang and I’m going to make a video that is going to call everyone out on their bs and how they treated me throughout the course of my life. They have to know- I’ll be the statistic they’ll never forget,
672,Tell me I’m not an ugly piece of shit,
674,"I suffer so much I think I can become crazy, I want to die but not have the balls to do it.","I want to die. I don't know how to explain it more than that. I apologize first, because I already posted a message 1 month ago but not on the good board.
I feel the abuses I lived, my toxic parents and my self ugliness of soul will kill me. Nearly my 14 birthday, I had wrote letters of suicide, but no one did anything except my ex boyfriend who doesn't care anymore now.

I am an attention seeker, a liar, a socially awkward girl, and someone you would never love. I want to die so much. I had been bullied and the bully, I had been the cheated one and the side chick, I had been the good kid and the worst, I had been the sexy bitch and the ugly one, I don't even know who I am. 

I want to die, and had already found a way to do it. I want to die, because I know that my life is broken for ever now. I know my relative would probably miss me, but the pain is too strong. The only thing that scares me is the physical pain that I might feel.

I don't know what I am searching here. Probably someone to tell me to not do it, but I feel so destroyed I would probably not listen to you. One-day I would like to meet someone who will care of me. I would do anything for it.

I am an ugly person and don't want to be considered as a good one. Please, I don't know what to do."

And I wouldn't get to watch my nephew grow up. Pretty much that is my only reason to hold on right now. Am I quite literally hanging by a thread. Merry Christmas and happy birthday to me😑

Using DXM to feel normal, as a coping mechanism, as an excuse, diagnosed with ADHD and have funnel chest( **Pectus** excavatum ). Not looking for a pity-party just want to talk about my life. I tried to kill myself twice, both times I was on drugs, the first time I was with a woman, who was a narc, Jenny was her name.  


I knew her family, cousins, I was into drugs, all the while she was cheating on me for 4 years. Everyone around me was willing to provide proof. Yet I never wanted to see it. I had multiple apartments. I also had two hernia surgeries around 6-9 years old. Parents said I would lift bowling balls and tables. Recently I found out in the past 2 years god is real and also that we are in the end times. I wrote some letters to someone in my area, she probably thinks I am crazy. I told her how I felt about her, but I am in such a damaged place, I keep losing jobs, I feel like I am going to break anytime. But I know GOD will see me through this!  


I am very, very, depressed and I cry almost every night. My narc dad says it is the pills, but I know my body. It does not matter anyways, I just need some slack.  


If I said anything that offended I am sorry, I really just typed this out of my head without thinking and I sliced down and sideways while blacked out while on benzos. I don't know what to say anymore. I don't even trust myself."

last year i was only 155. i somehow put on all of that weight that ive ever lost again and i don't have the motivation to lose it. i just want to eat all day, drink soda, alcohol and consume massive amounts of food. everytime i look at myself in the mirror or of old photos of myself i just can't stand it. i hate myself so much. i feel so fucking disgusting and undesirable. i feel so worthless for being such a fat piece of shit.

the only way i know how to make myself feel better is by eating. if i'm not eating, i'm not happy. but if i cant fit into my clothes in a few months that's it. it's over for me. i won't be here anymore. fuck everything else."

Body bag, carry to the truck to the trash. Well, after I’m cremated that is. 

I have another lawyer call this week moving closer to the final divorce. Hoping next month is where it’s at.  As I’ve said in other posts, I have to wait until the divorce is final so I can change the insurance so she gets nothing. My life is over. Each day I wake up, I’m acting.

I wish I could see a bright side or a way out of this. I am so alone. I am so lost. I don’t see an end to this pain. I don’t deserve sympathy. I deserve all the bad things that are happening to me. I wreck the people I love. I can’t be trusted. Everything is completely falling apart and I can’t fix any of it. It’s too late to make up for the mistakes that I made. I just want out of this existence. I’ll never have love. I don’t deserve it. I hate waking up every day and having to be me. Having to relive those horrible things I’ve done. Every one deserves so much more and I have nothing to give. I fucked up. I ruined everything. I’ve always ruined everything. I sabotage every good thing in my life. I’m sorry. So fucking sorry.

690,"Tired of my stupid decisions and bad luck, want to end it all.","Moved into my own 1bedroom from roommates due to stress and my mental health issues,

Chose a cockroach and possibly bedbug infested apartment, moved again and possibly carried bed begs to apartment I'm in now. Caused a fuss about the heating which was low, then bedbug scare which I later said was allergies but might still be bedbugs, then broke toilet pump since it was making noise all the time ( I have noise sensitivity, doesnt help with loud person above ).
So the management will likely evict me and say my unit is messy which it's not, 

Also my job is way too much for me, looks like I won't make probation even if I go part time now.
Luckily I have some savings built but not much, and I don't know what apartment I should get next since I don't know how much will be making and also don't know how to get rid of bedbugs if I have them. Paying 2 rents plus movers is gonna hurt my finances, it's all too much.

I just feel so dumb and unlucky, my first time trying to be independent and I'm fucking it up. I'm so scared it will get worse, not sure I could emotionally handle that.

692,Dropout in Singapore (17M).,"To preface, I have autism, so my words may come up a little awkwardly.

I’ve spent 5 years in secondary school, constantly failing. I made it through in Sec 1, dropped to normal stream in Sec 2, wormed through Sec 3 and failed Sec 4. I repeated the year, but I’m not sure I can get through again.

There is a way out should I fail: private school. But it’s hella expensive. I feel ashamed that my mother spent so much money on me and got nothing in return.

I had a fight with my father about a week ago. Nasty shit. Blows were traded, vulgarities screamed, my grandmother pushed over. My phone, computer and tablet were taken away.

Today I won my phone back in a game of table tennis. Would take a couple more wins to win back my computer and tablet. But when I asked my dad whether he’ll take them away if I fail, he just said I won’t want to know.

Now I don’t spend time online usefully. Just mess around Reddit, listen to songs, write stupid fanfiction and delete them because they’re stupid, you know. But I have to use them. I can’t live my life.

When I’m on the net, I don’t feel like a failure, an idiot about to flunk secondary school. I’m an activist in the dirty world of politics. I’m the God of my little stories, birthing, raising up and killing my little characters.

It’s pathetic, but I can’t live the life of the beaten down school flunky I am. I live the lives of my regular Reddit account, my YouTube account, my writing account.

But I can’t do that any longer.

I’m lost. I’m scared. I can’t sleep at night. I can’t do anything but wait for my results to come back and crush me.

So someone, speak to me."
693,"Sometimes, there’s just nothing left to do. Dying is my best option; I’m just waiting for the right time.","So, I’m homeless. If you can name a resource application, it’s either not an option or I’ve already applied. My counselor keeps giving me pointless homework. I’m sheltered with my friend’s in-laws over the holidays, but after that I have nowhere to go. No one wants me in their house. No one wants me. I feel abandoned by my church community. Every effort I’ve made to improve my situation is futile.

I just can’t do this anymore. I can’t seem to bounce back. I’m planning to opt out, I just don’t know when.

Right now, I just wanna talk. I have some friends nearby, but I’m worried that if I disclose my thoughts, that then I’ll definitely have nowhere to stay."
694,Planning to kill myself next week,"This year made me realize that life will never get better for me.
After 20 years of being a stupid failure and making everyone's life harder I decided I don't want to bother anyone no more.
I was bullied in school, beaten up in foster care and raped by someone I considered my best friend at the time. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Depression ruined my life. I don't have the energy to attend school and the only person I talked to personally in the last two months is my fiancé who I am a burden to.
I can't even manage to leave my apartment anymore. 

Now I am in debt and don't even know how long I still have energy or even a roof above my head.

All that made my decision even easier because I know I do not have the energy to face all this bullshit.
I hate the fact that I will never achieve anything in my life and I am so sorry to do this to my fiance but I just want to die.

I just hope he will move on relatively fast because he deserves someone who isn't as worthless as me.


I am going to either drown myself inside a lake (I can't swim)
Or jump off a cliff near my city at midnight to end all of this.

This will be my last post on Reddit and right now is the first time in a long while where I am completely content with myself."
695,My thoughts keep coming back to this,"I attempted to complete suicide before. Bag on head, hung myself....  friend kicked in door and I was hospitalised for a week but no after-care.
I guess I've had a few other attempts.... drinking and taking pills till I passed out. 

Just now I feel as though I'm slowly commiting suicide by leading a dangerous life...  drinking and taking prescription drugs by the handful and not caring if I wake up.

I've already thought out a plan for soon....  I'm going to take several disposable bbq into a little hobbit hut I rent while walking.  I'll drink and take sleeping tablets till I pass out.
I'll pay for several days in the hut so no one will find me too early. 
I'll tape up half the room and put up a sign so that any one who enters the hut will see right away that they need to move away.

Anything else I need to think about?"
696,Why do we care what others think of us once we’re dead?,"Why do we write suicide notes? Or feel bad if someone we know gets hurt by our suicide? Or wonder if anyone will even care? Etc etc

This is just our ego, in one way or another, trying to live on even once we’re dead. I mean what is the point of life really? There is no goal, and if you think deeply about even the most important things we do, they aren’t particularly meaningful - if we didn’t feel the rush of emotions when taking part in those important things then they wouldn’t even matter the slightest. 

Well that’s what we are. Nothing matters. Emotions drained. Everything seems pointless. We are viewing the world as it is; without the intense soundtrack that makes the scene; without the lightning that gives the scene character - we’re seeing the plain, unedited film. And it sucks.

I don’t even think killing myself will fix anything tbh. That’s the saddest part of it all."
697,might kill myself on january 10th,"i just want to end everything already. i plan on jumping off the bridge near my school or throw myself into the train tracks on my way home. 

i just really hate myself. i hate how i look, i hate my obnoxious yet boring personality, and im a such a pig. im drowning in school work 90% of the time and my grades are slipping. and im afraid my friends and current boyfriend all secretly hate me and will eventually throw me away.

my ex encouraged me to kill myself a few times a while back. his friends also kept harassing me through social media. and out of anger, i attacked him for it because this isnt his first time and ive had enough. he’s done worst but, ill save that for another post another time. i lost a few friends too from that because everyone was so convinced he was an angel. i got even more pissed when my mom forced me to apologize and was suspended for the week. 

i do go to therapy and im on medication, but lately ive been skipping both because they havent been helping me. if anything they’ve made me feel worst. im afraid of telling my mom again because shes also stressed and busy. and if i do tell my therapist, im afraid ill be partiality hospitalized again. 

im just really tired and fed up with everything. i go on vacation with my dad on the 23rd and come back the 9th of january. and the next day, i’ll probably just end my life."
698,Feeling really worthless,"I am scared of how I feel, I feel so worthless and undeserving of life. I looked up drugs you can od on wondering what we have around. I don't think I am going to but it is such a scary feeling."
699,I'm here to listen,"Even if you want to talk about stupid stuff!  Especially if you just want to talk about anything, star wars, books, history, anything.   If you are depressed we can talk about that, but if you want to talk about anything besides your crushing depression, I'm here to listen for that as well.  I'm still at work, so don't expect speedy replies, but be assured I will reply.  I'm here."
700,Reason(s) to stay alive-A journal,"The one that will almost always be there is because my Mom said she will die if I die too, so. But other than that.

As of today, 12/16/19,

1. I haven’t done my laundry yet. My room is a fucking dirty mess. Can’t be found dead like that.

One is enough.

We will stay rotting through the day."
701,Killing myself after Christmas,This shit sucks man
702,I made my dad cry today,Basically told him I wanted to kill myself and had no desire to work or have kids. I want to end this hellish corporate nightmare we are living in and just die.
703,Killing myself after Christmas,This shit is pointless.
704,im just fucking exhausted,"its so tiring to resent everything everyone and yourself, so tiring to deal with this pointlessness and most of all im just so tired of feeling im tired of feeling so angry sad upset im tired of feeling the emptiness otherwise as happy as i should be im tired

i know when im going to do it i just pray that the medication will work, or better, theres a plausible place to hang from in the class. i havent checked the classrooms before the holidays. i feel if i overdose along with jumping off would mean a higher chance of dying

i cant imagine anything after i dont want to survive or not try to, i cant think anything"
705,The only thing keeping me alive,"For now. Letters. So many letters. I can’t die knowing I didn’t give an explanation. One to each of my (5) friends, one to each of my parents, one to my sister, one to the teachers that made school as bearable as it could be until it wasn’t, one to each of the people I wanted to get to know better but never took the chance. The only thing keeping me alive. Once I finish I can die in peace."
707,"No, talking about it won't help me","No, I won't call helplines if I'm feeling suicidal. I already know enough that talking doesn't help me, I've been here for 8 years now. I need help, or death. Why do people think they've solved everything just by throwing numbers at me? Help me please"
708,Thinking maybe after the new year,"Shit just keeps blowing up in my face. My best friend decided to tell me last min that instead of me moving with her out of state she wants to go live with her fuck buddy to see if they can make things work... Now I have only a month to find a place for myself and my 2 dogs. This is the second time this year that I'm getting left behind by a roommate. This whole year has just been one thing after another and I just want it to end... I can't even afford to live so why should I even bother.
Ignore me. Just needed to say something somewhere"
709,I'm tired of getting yelled at,I should never have moved back in with my mom. I called in sick today but she was not happy with me being home and so I get scolded for various things. I'm just tired of this life.
710,"Banned from my favourite sub that brought me happiness during lunch and stress, failing school and finals. I don’t know what to do",I hate everything
711,I'm really sorry,"i don't know how I'm supposed to say this. So before I start, I'm really really sorry.
It's like I'm fine one moment and the next im in the corner, shaking and crying. 
I'm really really sorry but I think you should stop wasting your time on me. I love you more than anything in the world but I know you have greater things ahead of you. I don't want my sadness to rub off on you. I just can't anymore. I really can't. I'm sorry but it's just getting worse. I'm just in a complete void. I feel like I'm dead already. I can feel soul giving up.
I want you to know that I really love you, please never forget how absolutely amazing you are.
I can't live like this anymore. I can barely tell you what I want to say because my hands are shaking. And even if I make it through the night, you deserve someone who isn't mentally destroyed.
I really can't see a way forward from here.
Promise me not to do anything stupid, you have so much potential and it would be a shame to throw it away like that.

thank you for everything

i just have no more strength. I've cried myself to sleep too many times. Everyone is just anticipating it. I feel like there are parts of me desperately trying to convince me to just pick up the pills and do it. I can't get out of this. I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm really really sorry. Please don't do what I'm doing. Please move on. please find a stable person to lean on. I can't help you, I'm useless. I was enough for people to experiment their urges on, I was enough for people to take their anger out on. I wasn't enough to deserve an actual life, a childhood. I wasn't enough to deserve an attempt at reconciliation. But its okay, because I can't feel anything anymore. It's already over. I'm literally choking on my own tears. My pillow is soaking wet. I just need to set myself free. I know for a fact that the devil can't wait. He won this round. I can just feel the lifelessness wash over me. I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive me, just as much as you need to forgive yourself. I hope God forgives me. I wish you all the best. Feel free to have any of my belongings, I'd rather have that than have them go to some ungrateful nigerian relatives. Perhaps my PC, my favourite hoodies and t-shirts, my phone, anything. That way you could at least benefit something out of this relationship. I'm sorry for being so terrible to you. I'm sorry for not being what you need.
My last words to you: I love you, please, never forget that, I'll never forget you
-yours truly"
712,Ready for the end,"My mom and dad have been arguing a shit ton lately and my mom always tries to drag me into it. Its overwhelming to always feel like its my fault and for my mom to make me feel guilty. Im literally failing school because of this, and at this rate, band class is the only thing keeping my life together. If this continues, i might end up killing myself because honestly, its the only way i can get away from this bullshit."
713,Suicidal ideation but no active intent or plan,"I find myself just thinking how pointless my life is. I get chronic feelings of emptiness where I just don't care if my death impacts my loved ones, I just wanna stop existing. I don't feel I'm worthy of anybody's love or affection even though I have so many people that do care about me. That's mainly what's kept me from ending everything in the past, but I fear one day I just will not care and do it.

I think of just sitting on the edge of a building, facing away from the ledge and falling so my head will hit the concrete and just be over with, but I fear failing my attempt and ending up in a lot more pain or even a vegetable. 

I don't want to get old. I am not even 30 yet and my body already aches. I see my elders hobbling with arthritis and struggling with incontinence and just don't want to be there myself. I've always thought when my parents die, I could wait to kill myself then. But I also have friends and siblings and a partner who don't want me dead. 

I have already sterilized myself so I will never have kids. I don't want to pass anything of myself down. If the point of life is to reproduce, I'm definitely pointless, I've assured myself of that."
714,"So I'm preparing the notes for myself, within the upcoming weeks if all goes well i wont have to endure this much longer.","Id rather not go into detail about what Ive done so wrong to bring myself here but rather a couple questions about this. 

I'm planning on leaving the notes next to my body but I'm unsure if I should leave notes at all? Long Story short my family is more or less edging me to just go through with it  so is a note even needed? They want it to happen so I suppose there isn't much for them to want to know? Should i leave the note on my desk in my bedroom? If i leave them a note I'm not sure they're going to read it or just toss it anyhow. It seems frivolous at this point and I'm just eager to get this over with"
715,Trying to give up,"Had another episode today. It put into perspective why though. I get depressed and suicidal whenever I decide that it's hopeless to try and get a girlfriend. 
How do I give up on such a fantasy? I may have high functioning autism but I'm a good looking guy, good with money and I'm working on having a great career.  Every gay guy that has gone out with me under the cover of friendship tells me how ""amazing"", great and ""uniuqe"" I am and I'm sick of it. 
If I have alllll of this stuff going for me, then why can't I get a girl? Then I go spiraling again.

The only answer I have is either a bullet or giving up on the idea of a good altogether.
So how do I give up?"
716,My mind is spiralling out of control...,"I'm having quite a bad mental health day.  I have previously attempted suicide (20 years ago), and I can't get the thoughts out of my head right now.  I messaged everyone I could think of in my phone looking for support, a conversation, and no-one is getting back to me.  I live in a different country to my parents (who aren't the most supportive anyway).

I don't know what I hope to achieve by posting here, but if anyone can offer me any virtual support, I could really use some.   Thank you for reading, and sorry for the ramble."
717,Do you guys listen music when you are feeling depressed or suicidal? I started to doing it and...,"Is kinda odd but it feels like a beautiful pain. All the shit that I go through, how miserable I feel for being such a fucking loser good for nothing and all the constant thoughts about ending my misery life by killing myself gets amplified when I listen to sad songs but it also feels like I just want to continue living to just listen those songs... idk, is a weirfld feeling.

Anyways, if you wanna tell me which songs you listen when you are feeling down feel free to put it on the comments.

One of my fav songs is Rock Bottom by Eminem, is such an honest and sad song about feeling worthless ""My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams"""
718,Does anyone want someone to talk to?,"I'm lonely and feel like shit, am looking for other people who are lonely, feel like shit, and are possibly interested in wildlife sciences or weird ocs cos it's almost all my autistic ass knowns how to discuss"
719,Actually wanting to die,"I read so many posts here of people that want to die because of a terrible situation they're in, which seems endless for them. I often hear people say ''You don't want to die, you just don't want to live the life you're living now!'' and thats probably true for most people, but how do you cope when you áctually want to die? I don't want a life at all. I'm not in a bad situation, i'm not going through something tramatic, I just don't have a will to live, to do anything: no motivation. I don't think I ever had."
720,I can never be cured of my autism. :( I will never be normal.,I had to be revived at birth because I was born not breathing. I wish they had left me dead.
721,(Update) I miss you so much,"[Here's the original post.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/eat4w4/i_miss_you_so_much/)

So on Saturday I wrote a letter to a friend who I had hurt saying how much she was worth for me. A friend convinced me to send her the letter. She answered me and we talked for hours. She said she had missed me a lot and that she thought I hadn't missed her, she also said she felt she was to blame. I felt happy like I hadn't felt for years. I do love her quite a lot and that is quite a good feeling. But now I feel selfish. I'm going to kill myself and I just have reminded a girl who had probably forgotten me of my existence and told her how much I love her. I feel awful and now the fear of her leaving me again contributes to me wanting to die."
722,I cant go on with the path my life is going on...It is too much.,"Throwaway --- obviously...

I hate every aspect of my life, my relationship...my job...my financial status. 

I am about to lose my home. I have never said (typed) that out loud before. No one knows this and I am too scared to tell anyone. I am too scared to call the loan company for assistance. I dont have money to save anything. Bank account overdrawn, etc. I am scared. I feel that if I am no longer here it will just be easier for everyone since I have fucked up so much financially. 

The only thing that keeps me here is my child. They are 5 years old and light of my life. I do not want to leave them alone in this world. Yes, they will have the other parent and family, and I am hoping they will care for them as I have. I hope one day they will forgive me for taking the ""easy way out"". I just cant. I am waiting on a ""hookup"" for some pills to come through then I will just take them all. I am at my last...I just cant.

I'm sorry...I dont know where else to release this..."
723,My phones on 5%. When it dies im not charging it again.,
724,this is the only option left,"I can't make people like me, but I so unhappy alone. I'm a good person. No one sees it. No one will give me a chance.

I just want one certain man to just give me a chance. He won't and if he won't even notice that I exist, there's nothing I can do. He has to notice me first. He has to initiate. That's all I ever wanted out of life and I won't get it.

So I can't just keep going on like this. I deserve better. I'm so scared, but I have to do this now."
725,What would happen if I too took much Setraline (Zoloft),"One of my main fixations when I’m thinking about suicide is taking as many of my antidepressants as I can, I just want to know if I am in serious danger with these compulsions and should ask someone I live with to keep my antidepressants safe for me or is my biggest concern having a bit of a stomach ache"
726,My girlfriend wants to suicide,"She told me:""basta, non ce la faccio più. Porcod*o. Addio"" (""let's stop it, i can't stand it any more. *blasfemical word*. Goodbye""

It all started by a friend who sent a video in a group which said to send that to a sad friend. I said that video reminds me about my gf and makes me cry.
My gf said she'd like to cry and so she did. I wasn't online at the moment. When I reenter the chat both my friend and my gf are talking about life's problems and things like that. I tried to be helpful by saying I can make people happy but I only worse the situation. My gf asked why were I so far (500km) and she talked about how shitty is her life. Then she typed that messages. She powered off her phone immediately after.
I don't know what to do, she always wanted to somehow excape from her life. ""when I cross the zebra crossing, I Simply don't see what's coming towards me and I hope for a miracle"". Her words 4 months ago.
Help me"
727,I just took 4 pills I don’t what’s going to happen,
728,When you don’t even have the courage to kill yourself,"Lol. The knife was pretty sharp but I barely pressed it hard enough against my skin for it to start bleeding, I ran it over like slicing bread, and pretty much no harm was made. And that’s the most I could do. I know so many ways to kill myself rn but I’m not doing any of them. I’m just extremely desperate but too much of a coward to actually take myself out of this. I love this sub. No TW needed. I pray for a sudden instant death for myself. Soon. Before my next round of hope-despair-repeat cycle begins."
729,What I felt today,"I was in a warehouse today. I just walked in, because I didn't want to go home just yet. Work was boring and looking at stuff, toys, books, makes me kinda happy most of the time, but it's also distracting and calming. Not a good idea in the holiday season though, which I'd stupidly forgotten. I looked at expensive Lego sets and thought about how much of a waste it would be to buy one for myself, how it would collect dust and how I'm not a kid anymore but on the other hand somehow want to play with it... Build stuff, make something with my hands. Then I thought how easy it would be to live those feelings and how easily you could get away with buying a big, expensive set, if you just had a child or at least there was one in your family. Then I quickly put the set down because I felt creepy to be looking at things for kids. A father called his daughter who was hiding a few feet away from me, behind a giant box. I pointed at her, he thanked me and looked reliefed, she gave me a ""oh cone on... I want to stay here, asshole""-look. I walked away, thinking that nobody could know if I have a child. I knelt down to look at another box, when two younger guys talked about finding a certain game. I got up and gave them the address of a local gamestore for more ""nerdy"" boardgames which I knew had wgat they we're looking for... And I put another box down again and left the store. I felt like crying and extremely alone walking home. Like someone was going to punch or kill me any second for being such a worthless person. I thought about how I lost my dad so early and how my whole family broke apart more and more. I thought about how lonely I am and how I hoped that if anybody would miss me, they would only miss me when I'm dead and hopefully, no surely, they'd then realize all the good things I always tried to do for them. How I rescued lives, how I always listened and tried to make everyones day better with the simplest things. How I always tried to talk about how I feel... But only a therapist would understand me. I am only 31, but I've been to 12 funerals of people I dearly loved or whose death hurt me more than I thought at first. It feels like being punished for trying to be happy. It has felt this way since I was a child. I have a trauma from when I was little and my parents were to blame for that. I'll never be able to tell my mother I like her. Therapy made this even clearer. I'm too old to have kids or to buy a house or to start planning for the future. I thought my last girlfriend was the one, but when I finally found the courage, at fucking 29 years old, to talk with her about a possible future, and after she thought that was good idea for quite a while, she suddenly had a change of heart and told me adult life was not for her and left me on the spot. No I have major trust issues and can't even stand being flirted at anymore... I feel repulsed, disgusted and have to leave the scene. I mean... It's Christmas time, so everything is especially bad, but... I'm always setting dates or events to be the moment where I kill myself, but I don't. I feel empty when the moment arrives. Too empty to pull through or even think about it. All I want to do is sit in silence. Stop feeling and everything awful in the world and to feel at peace. But it's not going to happen. I don't care enough about anything to kill myself, but I really, really want to die. Just to be at Peace forever and finally stop all the suffering I have to endure and can't get away from."
730,"Planned on cutting my wrists just now, until I read statistics.","I was finally ready to end it all. I just feel so fucking empty and I just don't have the strength to carry on anymore. I got everything ready, but wanted to check what was the best way to do it, and saw that the mortality rate is approximately 6 % and usually just leaves you with a scar. People (friends and family) would probably think it's just for attention seeking or whatever, and I just don't want to be a pity case. I'm so sad that I couldn't pull through and feel like such a failure."

732,Is there a facility that rehabilitates people with major depression,"Cause I need it. I’m thinking more and more about how to escape my situation but unfortunately the thought processes aren’t “work hard, save money, quit drinking, get back in the gym and download Tinder.” Instead it’s... “buy rope on amazon, learn how to tie noose, throw away computer and tablet.” 

I turn 30 one week from today and am SO FAR from who/where I thought I would be by this age. Didn’t even come close to accomplishing my dreams and goals. I currently talk to no one all day, every day and if it weren’t for alcohol I’d probably go insane from loneliness. But my future just feels so empty and hopeless."
733,Can’t take this anymore.,I feel like at this point I’m destined to die I’m just gonna end it
734,I’m determined not to die,I am in a lot of pain right now. Shits going down in my life. I’ve basically lost everything in a span of 3ish weeks. My family. My girlfriend. Most of my money. I’ve been making some stupid decisions. I’ve been diagnosed with a mental illness. I try to distract myself. But deep down the only thing I can think of is wishing I was dead. I’m not ready or even close to calling it completely quits yet. I just have no determination to get out of bed or do anything I want to. I feel so lost and alone. I don’t know what to do
735,Im sorry to bother everyone with this,"Hi guys. So I normally dont do this kind of thing but I am at a loss. I have just been dealt every shitty card I can imagine and I dont know how much more fight I have left in me. 

This is going in other subreddits too so if you want to just see the financial summary read the last few paragraphs 

Heres the story from the beginning (summarized):

I was a super smart kid. Straight As from elementary to post high school. Super depressed. Super bad anxiety. Horrible shit going on in the family. I still did super well. I was very high functioning. Went into high school, worked 35 plus hours a week, battalion commander in JROTC, beta club, national honors society, the full shebang. 

I had almost all of my college paid for by grants and scholarships, with the exception of books and about 200 dollars. As you all probably know that still adds up to a pretty hefty amount when you are poor and dont have any help from family. I was going to school full time and working too. All while having a pretty severe cocktail of mental and physical ailments brewing. First semester went pretty well. Was feeling off but still made the Dean's list and all that. My APS job (on campus I internship type job that pays for a portion of your schooling) was going well. I thought everything was fine. 

ThEN second semester rolls around. I start getting sick, physically and mentally, so bad to the point I didn't even feel like a person. I still busted my ass. I was working full time over Christmas break to try to save for books. It wasnt enough.  Then my laptop shit itself. So I took out a loan before the semester started. It took over 2 months to get the money. So I had to go to class every day without the materials I needed to pass. The way my university works there are codes you have to download and apps and all kinds of stupid shit. And the classes are interactive on the computer so the teachers know you are following along. You are graded on your electronic and your physical presence in class. So I was set up for failure in that aspect. There was literally no way for me to actually participate. And they wouldn't let me make up tests or anything.  

While I'm dealing with all of that, my aps job FORGOT TO PUT ME ON THE SCHEDULE FOR THE SECOND SEMESTER. so they expected me to know what to do even though it was their job to put me on the schedule. So at this point I'm freaking out and about to either kill myself or drop out.  But dropping out wasnt an option cause I was supposed to be the first member of my family to go to college. And I was one of the few to graduate high school. So the expectations for me were insanely high. So I opted to kill myself.  I tried. One of my friends said she got a ""gut feeling"" something was wrong and gave me a call as I was getting in my car to go do the deed. She could tell something was wrong and happened to be driving by my dorm to see what I was up to and dragged my ass out of my car and made me go to the counseling center. I thanked her for that up until today. 

I went. They wrote me notes for all of my classes. They said I should be excused from everything and can get a fresh start. I was very optimistic. I went to class the next day and not one of my teachers cared. They all told me to get fucked basically. So then I talked to financial aid and asked if I could just take a break and come back to school or just drop all my classes and get an incomplete and then start over the next semester. She said that shouldn't be an issue. So I did. 

A few months later I am feeling dejected and I am just super disappointed in myself for not figuring out how to fix this. I had never failed his hard before. Or really at all. So I applied at a call center. Started feeling more physically ill.  With it, my mental health started deteriorating. 

I spend the next 2 years jumping from doctors to psychiatrists from job to job. I was miserable. I was in a really abusive situation with my roommates. I overdosed on pills on my front porch while I was watching the sky and they found me the next day somehow still alive. So I was like fuck I guess I need to get it together since I've tried this shit 2 or 3 times now and its not worked. So I did research. I tried working again. I figured out what was wrong with me before the doctors did. I told them I thought I had thyroid issues. They told me I was too young. I was 20 at the time. 

From 20-21 I was homeless. Dont wanna go into that. I am still traumatized. So we will skip this part

February of last year after babysitting and busting ass and having all kinds of side hustles to try to work around my anxiety and still make money I saved enough to get my own place. I moved in and then shit went south again. Debt collection companies were blowing my line off the hook. I wasnt able to make payments. I could barely pay rent. 

So in March I go to the dr. Low and behold guess what I have. Hypothyroidism. Not only had I been suffering from adrenal fatigue for 3 years but my body has had irreparable damage done to it because I haven't been medicated and have been put thru so much stress. My anxiety is at an all time high. My depression is beating my ass. And now they're telling me I'm possibly bipolar and possibly have hashimoto's disease. 

My body literally attacks itself daily. And so does my mind. But I pulled it together. Got my own place. Got a full time job working for a group home and I have dreams and goals and aspirations and I genuinely felt like everything was gonna be okay. I'm doing so well. I'm getting better. I have fight in me. 

Until today. 

I get a call today and my APS scholarship didn't go thru because I didn't get my hours. So I owe 3000. With the interest that's been tacked on for 3 years or so its at 3600. They want me to pay it within a year. 

I work a thankless job. I work in the mental health field and I make 8.90 an hour. I bust my ass and work no matter how sick I feel. And no matter how much overtime I work I cant afford this, fixing my car, paying off my medical debt and this too. 

I dont know what to do

And I guess I just wanted someone to listen. I just dont know what to do anymore. 

I want to give up. 

I try to pour nothing but love into the world and then everything that could hit me decides to hit me when I have hope. 

Oh on top of all this my wallet with over 600 bucks for Bills and christmas got stolen while i was at the fuckibg doctor. That would have helped. 

I'm just so beat up. Someone please give me advice."
736,The voice says I should do it,"Right so basically here's the story

I'm a 13F and...I don't know what's wrong with me tbh

I am cutting myself but I don't really...want to commit suicide 
I'm not v sure but I think I have NSSI disorder (non-suicidal self injury disorder) 

Recently I have had an argument with my friends bc they where being EXTREMELY annoying, saying I'm fkn racist
Ik it seem pathetic but I get v annoyed very easy
So I've basically diagnosed myself

I'm cutting bc:

I get bullied every single day (by my friends also, sometimes it gets too much but I don't tell them bc I decided that I just am going to push all of my fellings down and just have a mental break down when no one is around me)

My mum constantly fkn shouts at me (I don't mind it but...), She literally tells me TO MY FACE that if she sees that I'm cutting then she will take me down to the hospital and tell the doctor that I have mental issues when in reality I just think she can't be fucking bothered to understand why I'm sad (she hasn't noticed my cuts yet)

Someone close to me died (it was years ago but it still effects me v much)

I want to be things (job wise) in my future, but I know for a fkn fact that I'm too fkn trash to do any (I want to be an artist, music producer or a singer -- yes ik it's dumb -_- )

School is so incredibly stressful I can't cope and it make me feel like hurting the teachers, punching walls, crying ect. (Tbh I do make it harder on myself by not doing homework and skipping detentions, but when they shout at me it just makes me feel hurt)

Ffs I've got problems
I haven't been ACTUALLY diagnose with any problems but I've basically diagnosed myself based on what I've seen and searched (yh ik it's stupid)
So I've diagnosed myself with - Autism, ADHD (maybe), im pretty fkn sure I have anger issues -_- and I'm definitely think I have dislexia (ok I ended up looking this up and it's actually spelt dyslexia but I just wanted u to see my attempt to show u how retarded I am -_-)

I this rate I basically have no friends or friends that r a bad influence

I'm rlly fkn ugly so I'll be fkn alone 4ever :}

And I can't be myself around others bc I'm too scared that I'll get judged based on my personality 



(This is irrelevant but my friend who basically try to 'help'   me says that my friends basically bullying/annoying me r just jokes and I should ignore it -_- I don't think she gets that I CANT ignore it, my brain legit cant NOT acknowledge all the things ppl say/whisper about me)



Now on to the voice part of this:

Lately I've been having this..little voice..in my ear telling me to do things
For example -- hurt my friends, kill my friends, hurt myself, die, make everyone (including family) hate me to make it easier to die ect.

Obviously I don't do any of those things....well...I hurt myself -_- but my friends know I'm trying to make them hate me sooo yeahh....I don't want to hurt my friends and tbh...I'm too scared to die

The voice has told me it's name and what it's 'mission' is

So basically
I'm pretty sure I'm either -- going insane :] Oorrr...I'm just imagining shit -_-



So yeah....just deciding on wether I should just do it or not, thought I should let the ppl of Reddit help me decide considering I can't decide shit for myself unless I make a fkn list (CBA) 

So
Should I?
Or
Should I not?"
737,"I want to OD, but I feel scared/guilty","I have been suicidal for sometime now, this will be my 5th attempt. I have a date, the pills and everything else planned out. I just need to move some stuff and find good homes for my pets.

11 years ago, when I was 13, I tried to overdose. I survived and just ended up with a bad stomach ache. A few days later a friend of mine also overdosed. She survived but ended up with severe brain damage and has to be under constant medical care.

Whenever I feel suicidal, I think back to her and just feel so guilty. Why did that happen to her and not to me? Then I feel scared because I dont want that to happen to me. 

My attempts before have all been impulsive. But this time I have put alot of thought into everything. I have already started giving away/selling my things and will probably quit my job tomorrow. I am just so tired of everything. I have tried really hard to make improvements in my life but I always end up back in the same place. I am tired of being controlled, and always being there for others, when no one is ever there for me. I am sad and alone all the time.

I have messed up everything and after thinking everything over, dying is the option I have left.

I plan to od by mixing some  oxy pills and vodka. I have about 60 pills, but they are expired so I hope they work.
Sorry for all the spelling and grammar errors"
738,I’ve never wanted to end my life this much,"Almost 2 months ago, the love of my life left me. We were in a long-distance relationship but had been together for over a year, known each other for over 4 years. We decided to stay as friends but I learnt that he has completely moved on in such a short span of time while I’m not even halfway there. 

On top of that, my grades are horrible and there’s possibly no chance of me getting into a University locally. I was born into a lower income family so studying abroad isn’t an option unless I work my ass off. Even then, I’ll just barely scrape by. Where I live, it is essential to have good grades &amp; get a degree in order to “survive”. 

I’ve been feeling sick lately for absolutely no reason &amp; whenever I go to see a doctor, they bring up ‘depression’ as a possibility but I’ve always shot it down saying I’m fine. I’m not fine. I’ve been in denial for so long because ‘depression’ has always seemed so scary to me and I’ve always been a cheerful and positive girl...till now. 

Today was the breaking point. When I learned my ex had already completely moved on and gave 0 fucks even as a friend, it just felt right to end myself there and then. I searched for ways to overdose. I had them in my palm. Then, my dad came home. 

I am 99% sure I don’t want to live anymore but I’m so afraid of doing it. There’s no reason for me to be here and I’ve thought of this so many times but I can’t seem to go through with it."
739,I want to stop existing,How do I make that happen so no one has to be sad
740,today i almost tried killed myself again,"these past few months, no, years have just been so stressful. that is why i decided that i was going to try again. i have been so upset and numb that it caused me to be unable to do basic things. today my mom asked me to leave my house so i took my bike and decided that i was going to run into a moving car. and i sat on the bench just crying and planning on how i was going to do it and i realized that i was just going to be sent to the hospital again. so i went back home. i just feel so empty right now."
741,Im not good enough for suicide,I always see other peoples storys and they're notes and they are often put through so much like abusive parents and they got raped and my problems just look not good enough and it should make me feel happy that i shouldn't kill myself but it makes me even more sad
742,I think I found a way to help the suicidal feelings.,"Music of your choice. Simple as that. I LOOOOVE Heavy Metal, Speed Metal or better combined. Makes me want to rush to streets at midnight or to learn a guitar lol. I hope it helps you. Any music imaginable. Even Nokia Arabic Ringtone. Anyway cya and have a good day, whoever you are and wherever you are. :)"
743,I’m done,I’m fucking done I’m sorry I can’t do this I’m sorry I’m done there’s no point I’m just such a fuck up. Don’t respond to this I don’t need help I just have no where else to talk. My brain is too loud. I’m so hungry to die.
744,Ever feel like you weren't meant for this world?,"My skin just isn't think enough for it all; the stress, the competition -- I'm so sensitive it's pathetic. I feel like no matter how successful I become, I'll always be a failure. Besides that, I can't help but feel like I'm always the odd one out: I don't like to be outgoing, I'm scared of having sex, hell, I can't even understand other people's emotions if they don't make them blatantly obvious.

In our society focused so much around conformity, I feel like an utter outcast."
745,Girlfriend in a rough spot. Time running out. Help please!,"I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world. She’s the most important thing in my life and we love each other more than anything/anyone we’ve loved before.

Things have gotten a little tough recently with the relationship and with a legal case involving a member of her family. 

She says that she’s going to kill herself in January and, although I’m not sure if she actually will, she has attempted twice before around that time of year. 

What the hell can I do??? I love her more than anything and I know she loves me the same. She says that sometimes, love isn’t enough to keep a person alive. This is breaking my heart. Anybody have good ideas? She’s 17 years old and I‘m 18."
746,Can't stop myself falling apart,"Writing this instead of journaling into a void. I suppose this is similar. 

A few weeks ago I began to explore some dark topics. I began exploring memories of childhood abuse with my therapist. I had been reading some books about the importance of opening up to intense emotions in therapy, and the need to work through trauma. 

I successfully raised extremely intense memories of physical and psychological abuse when I was a child. This opened up a torrent anger within me. The past two weeks the anger has begun to curdle into self-hatred. I feel pathetic that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm filled with anger at how much trauma and suffering I've endured. At how unnecessary it all was. How at Christmas I have to sit there with the psychopaths who committed and abetted this child abuse and pretend like we're a family. They all got to have lives. I was the outlet for their fucked up neuroses and problems - I had to bear the brunt of their suffering. And now we all have to pretend like it was simply a strange few years where I was the only child who was regularly abused and beaten. 

It's created a strange disassociation with the world. I've opened up a side of me, but can't do anything with it. I've begun to filter everything through this lens of abuse and trauma. All the ways it has influenced my failures. This is making me realise what a pitiful figure its turned me into. When I say I'm falling apart - I feel like I'm losing my narrative of agency. Thinking through all my health problems, mental health problems, social problems - it can all be connected to trauma. And I can't stop thinking like this. I don't know how to close this perspective. 

I've been slipping into suicidal ideation, especially the past week. Some mornings and nights I spent hours thinking through all the reasons I need to die. Right now I have a fantasy of slicing open my arms in a warm bath. It's all I want. I have the money to go out tomorrow, buy a craft knife from an art store, rent a hotel room with a bath.

Right now it seems like the right and inevitable point that this farce ends. I'm 30, turning 31 next year. I always told myself in my early 20's - just give yourself 30 years. If you still hate this after 30 years, then that's enough time to know. Right now I see no reason this will change. I'm so tired of living this damaged half-life."
747,I know I won’t get any answers...,"But it’s worth a try I guess? Can anyone tell me how they think I should do it? The one with most upvote wins. But seriously, I think I’m ready for it now. I don’t really want to think about anything else. I tried putting it off for some time and giving my life a second chance but it’s still the same and I’m done with it tbh. Please don’t tell me how everything is gonna be okay cause you know it doesn’t work like that and they are just words that even you don’t believe in. Let’s be honest you wouldn’t be here on this subreddit if you did. You can just dm me what you think should be enough to do it once and for all."
748,A decision to make,"I'm currently at a standstill in my life. I want to kill myself to relieve everyone of the disappointment that I am as a human being. On the other hand, I can't kill myself because I have a kind mother who doesn't deserve that to be done to her. I have tried therapy and medications but they don't help me anymore and I am just stuck. So I have a decision to make. Do I continue living out my suffering each and every day barely living to keep my mom happy, or do I end it all and relieve myself of this pain but leave my mom with more pain than ever. I don't know where people go after they die, but it's probably better than this."
749,I don't see any options,"I probably don't deserve to be on this board because I am not really worth anyone 's time but I just can't stop crying and thinking dying is the only way to solve anything.  


Recently I've gotten into university against my own will because my parents believe that university is the only way I can get by in life and I believe it too, but it's been awful for me, I hate my classes and I don't like showing up there. I've been able to make a few friends which made me feel better but they've abandoned me and are only getting closer and closer as I watch them from afar every day. I don't really understand how it happened. Me and one friend in the group had a fight and I was wrong but was too stubborn to admit it, but aside from that, I don't really recall anything bad happening between us, but they've all just started being rude to me and distant, I reached out saying I didn't understand why it was happening and they all ignored me. I tried to reach out in DMs again and one person told me how toxic I was and that she felt like she was losing freedom, but I've never tried controlling her and I tried my best to be supportive, I reached out when she was very down with support, I shared very intimate parts of my life with them.  


I don't really know if I have been toxic or not. I was really aggressive back in the day, I had a troubled childhood, even though it's not an excuse, I just tried working on myself and I can't seem to be enough. I am falling behind classes and I can't get anything done. I feel terrible all the time but my parents won't let me drop out and I honestly don't see any other options. Every day I think about my friends but I feel like tehy just mock me in secret, I feel isolated by my peers and misunderstood by my family. I feel like the only way to escape is to die, that way life won't be difficult anymore. I question my sanity a lot these days and can't understand anything starting from studying materials to social interactions.  I don't know what to do"
750,I’m gonna kill myself tonight. I give up,Nothing left to live for and I have another post explaining why.
751,It doesnt get better u just get older 34/f,"Dont kill yourself tho. U probably arent fucking cursed like me. 
I will forever be on the outside looking in."
752,"I've tried so hard, but I won't do this anymore","I'm making a plan. I'm going to follow through. It's not that I can't just keep going, it's that I don't want to and I won't. It's my life. I'm not leaving behind family, friends, etc -- if I had someone, I wouldn't do this. But I don't. So here goes...

I don't use any other social media and I needed someone to know."
753,Is there a way to manage depression for everyone?,"I get so frustrated when, it seems, everyone around me and everything I read says that depression and suicidal ideation can always be treated or  managed; if you just reach out, take your meds, go to counseling... you’re good to go! I’ve cycled thru that process dozens of times and yet, my depression continues to worsen. 

How can the medical community continue to peddle the notion that severe mental heath disorders are treatable in 100% of cases. What other illness or disease can doctors make that claim about? Obviously common colds, many bacterial infections and run-of-the-mill communicable diseases can be treated or vaccinated against but how can one expect chronic, often debilitating disorders to be 100% survivable, especially when those diseases are of the brain and terribly misunderstood.

I often compare my depression to cancer when I speak about it with loved ones. It’s impossible to vaccinate, has a fairly troublesome survivability rate, as well as a plethora of treatment options that the medical community has never been able to streamline. Each case is different, and even when you go into remission, the chance of it returning haunts you and often predisposes you to relapses. 

Clearly, people who commit or attempt suicide would largely disagree with the idea that their case could improve. Most likely repeatedly sought treatment and never got better. I am one of those and I’m fucking sick of people saying I need to try harder and that I’m the one who has to take those steps — that’s brilliant, Captain Fucking Obvious. I’ve consistently taken those steps for decades and here I am in the same hole.

I’m sick of being a burden and I’m beginning to believe that nothing after death could be as painful as what I’m experiencing now. 

I just needed to get this out. I don’t know what my next step will be but every single day I ask “god” to take me home. Any way possible. I don’t want to come back here. God I hope he comes through. 

Thanks for reading."
754,"I have set plans to kill myself shortly after the holidays. As a family member, would you want to know, or would you prefer to be kept in the dark?","Throwaway and on mobile. Your criticism won’t hurt my feelings, I simply want honest opinions.

This decision is made with a clear head and a somber heart. I’m not here to share my life story, maybe just offer pretense. I’m what you warn your kids against becoming if they don’t apply themselves. I’m a drug addict. I’m a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward. I shirk and run from responsibilities. I couldn’t hold down a job or stay in school because most days I was too weak willed to bring myself to leave my apartment. I’ve been through multiple therapists over the past few years. I’ve been through the ups the downs. I’ve lied to myself and others that I would change. I haven’t, I’ve lived my life selfishly and will end it the same. I’ve knowingly caused harm physically, mentally and emotionally to every individual who has ever called me a loved one. I’ve been verbally, mentally and emotionally abusive to anyone I’ve been close to. I’ve made promises I never intended to keep after being given trust, love, or even money. My health is rapidly declining, as of two weeks its been discovered I have a tumor in my damn testicles, and another in my chest. Seeing the excuse of a man I am now stands in stark contrast to the man I was raised to be. The emotional pain I will cause in my choice to kill myself is outshone by the cumulative pain I would cause if I continued to live. My view hasn’t and won’t change, I’m a waste of resources. The cost to repair my body outweighs my value and what I bring to the table."
755,I'm just a number,"To my school and parents I'm just a grade. To my doctors I'm just another patient and a whole lot of numbers, well and a paycheck too. To my ""friends"" I'm just 1 more in the group. What's the point."
756,I'm suddenly getting the urge to kill myself,"I do get bullied but my school does jack shit about it. The bullies tell me to kill myself and stuff like that. Normally I just laugh it off because it just feels right? Well today I didn't laugh and just stood there, actually taking a moment to realise I have no friends, I have no passion and I have nobody other than my sister who really cares about me.

Now I'm actually contemplating whether it would just be a burden off people's shoulders if I just did.

I just felt like typing it here as I have nobody to talk to about it."
757,Hello,"I made this account specifically to join this community and others like it. I'm having a really tough time right now and wrote my suicide note today. I have resources, I know how to get help, but I'm so tired of trying. It's exhausting and I really don't feel like it's worth it to keep fighting. Tomorrow is the first anniversary of a pseudo-attempt/breakdown from last year, and just remembering that is fucking with my head. I haven't decided how I would do it if I actually go through with it. This is the closest I've been to actually attempting to end it all, and I'm very scared."
758,"Not sure if this will get taken down, but if ANYONE would like to actually TALK about anything you're going through, add me on xbox - Bahlsy , and I will be all ears.",
759,I will be your friend,Please anyone who feels like they don’t have reason to live. Message me. There is so much to life then death. I will be your friend. We can talk through this. The world needs you here. You are beautiful and perfect just the way you are. I might not know your situation but I tried to take my life about 4 years ago. At the time I felt like I would be doing everyone a favor by taking my own life. I don’t want you to feel that way. I don’t want you to be alone.

761,privilege,"at this time of year, i realise how privileged i am. my mother can hardly afford to buy presents but at least i get some. i always think of the poorest people in society who suffer at this time and i wish one of them could be in my position instead of me. i’m so privileged and i still take everything for granted. i feel like death is my only escape from the immense guilt i feel. i hate the idea that i’m taking a valuable space in society when someone somewhere deserves it
more than me. the only thing i deserve is to stop existing."
762,"I don’t want my story to end in suicide, but it’s the only ending I see for me",I don’t see my life going anywhere. The only outcome I see for me is suicide
763,It never gets better,"It never does, I've done my waiting, I've played by the rules, I've been nice. It never gets better, just worse and worse and worse. I tried to kill myself 3 weeks ago, this time it'll work. No half measures, no bullshit. I'm done.

I'm just drinking for a bit, then gonna have my final meal. Then I'll do it.

Try and make the world a better place, because I couldn't stand it."
764,I just want to finally end it.,"Things won't get better because they've been the same for the past 3 years. Everday is filled with agony because of my rare disease (don't ask me which one) and my mental illness. Everyday I feel so light headed and like I'm about to faint. I'm sad all the time but only a few notice it.

Mental illness can go away,
but a medical condition will stay forever, why suffer?"
765,it's not going to get better,"I'm never going to have the life I want. I'm never going to be who I want. I can barely even afford to get enough food with this damn package handler job, so I sure as hell can't afford other things like medical insurance for therapy. And I'll likely be laid off after the holidays anyway. So I won't even have anything to eat come January. 

To make matters worse I think I might be trans, which is terrible 'cause I know I'll never be able to afford hormone therapy or transition surgery. I'll never get to be the woman I want to be. I'll always be stuck in this disgusting, hairy, chewbacca body with my deep ass Orson Welles voice. 

And even if some fairy godmother came along and gave me everything I needed, let me transition and everything, my family would never speak to me again. They've got that deep south religious bigotry ingrained in them from birth, and if their darling boy suddenly turned out to be a woman then they'd probably spit in my face and then promptly shun me for life. My brother would throw me out of his apartment and then I'd be fucking homeless on top of all my other problems. 

I can't live like this. It's too painful. Life fucking sucks, and I'll never be who I want to be. Fuck."

hmmm poland huh? i bet there are some beautiful people there huh? 

it seems like youre quite the professional! being in a foreign country might just be the best thing that could have happened to you. people over seas really do hold american degrees and experience to a higher standard. simply because our quality control is through the roof. if i was wearing your shoes, i would begin by assessing my situation. do i plan to stay in poland? if so how long? forever? if the answer is forever, my first step would be to learn the language. i think 3 months of dedicated time towards that would allow one to be able to function in a professional setting. step 2 would be to create the best damn resume those people have ever seen! highlight your degree, and emphasize that you owned 2 businesses. programming and web design is like riding a bike (speaking from experience) you dont need to know how to use every single program, you just need to learn whatever specific program that company is using. for example, i learned to use this program called quick books this year. it was so stressful, getting yelled at almost weekly but now im a freaking maverick. lol my co workers come to me for help now! anyway, back to you, after building that resume, open up a linked in account and look for jobs in the area. when you find one interesting to you find out what program they use and learn one step at a time. i mastered quickbooks from youtube, i swear to god. even though i have an accounting degree, they never freaking taught me how to use quickbooks! you know what i mean? you having those qualifications like experience and degrees just shows that you are ABLE to commit and learn whatever it is you need to. love you and am so proud of you:)&lt;3"
768,I told my therapist I was planning to kill myself,"Yesterday I watched The Joker. I cried for the first time in months. I rather liked the film and it made me even surer I should kill myself. Besides that, my younger sister (15) beat me. Yep, I felt humiliated and even more sure I should kill myself. I thought of commiting myself to a psycho ward but since I'm a minor (17), I need parental authorization and my mom has made it pretty clear she doesn't think I'll kill myself and that therefore she would never authorize it. Thefore, I decided to proceed with the planning. I told my therapist today that I was planning to kill myself. I'm quite calm, actually. I did everything I could do, I definitely fought for my life even with it being unsavoury. I'm somewhat proud considering that I managed to handle everything alone for quite a few years."
769,I'm just at a loss,"I'm facing another holiday season alone and I swore I wouldn't let it come to that. I've spent Christmas, etc., working or volunteering or surrounded by strangers. I don't want that again. I'm tired of that. I want to be with my own family, a spouse, children. But I don't have anyone and it's time to admit I'm not going to get it. I promised I'd end my life if I turned 40 and still alone. I attempted it, but failed. Four years later, nothing has changed, nothing has gotten ""better."" It's still the same, even though I've given every last ounce of my being trying to make it better. Sometimes, it just doesn't happen.

I loathe guns, but I won't have another unsuccessful attempt this year, so I bought one. It's the only thing that comes easy in the US, I guess, and put it under my Christmas tree. It's the only gift I'll get this year and I was going to wait and use it if II'm still alone on Christmas morning. But I can't wait. I just can't.

I wanted someone to know. Thanks for ready if you did. xx"
770,My best friend killed himself and im lost,I miss him. We used to watch out for each other all the time. We lived together and would never let the other be alone long enough to fall down a rabbit hole.  I'm ashamed to say that he didn't scare me away from it but drew me in. I think about it all the time now and my jokes about it don't even sound like a joke.  Sometimes I drink so I don't have to feel but I honestly just wish I could feel ok. Not sure what this post is for but it feels good to vent a little right now
771,Hello...? And Goodbye I Guess...,"So heres the story. Way back in February I planned my suicide and got everything ready. It was the first day of March and for some reason I chickened out and told my parents what was going on. My mom took me to the hospital. But the hospital refused to take me in despite my obvious self harm injurys on my arm. I sensed it was because I had volunteered to go to the hospital and they thought it wasn't too serious and maybe my mom talked them into letting me go home with her. Since then no one in my family has even brought it up and act like it didn't happen. (Except to tell me I'm crazy or to joke about my mental illness.)

 I was very upset by this event. Now I've got the idea in my head that no one will take me seriously unless I commit suicide. I got passed around a few therapists until my mom had enough of taking me every week and decided that anti-depressants are better. (She doesn't like therapists and doesn't even think they work) Since that day in march I've had many more quiet plans to end my life. I've had many self harm sessions and even a few sucide attempts but nothing was serious enough to take me to the hospital. With the holidays here, I only feel worse. I practically told my dad last night about how I'm sucidal. My dad is the only person I trust to help me because he's not manipulative like my mother. But I guess I was wrong to trust him. He made a joke out of me in front of my siblings and told me ""Be careful of what you say. You sound like your doing this for attention."" I couldn't believe it! I was deeply hurt that the one person I trust didnt even take my seriously. So I made a quick decision and tried to end my life last night. I took some sleeping pills. But at last, here I am... Nothing happened other then sending me to bed earlier than intended and a stomach ache (but that might just be my anxiety). 

I'm thinking of trying again. But I think I'm going to try to take it very serious this time, so I'm going to have to plan everything out. ( get Chores done, keep things kept nice and clean, update my sucide note, blah blah etc.) But I'm not for sure. Since Christmas is in 1 week and that would suck for my family. And the slight chance I live means I could be stuck in the hospital for Christmas. But I dont really care. I guess I'm just looking for some support really. For anyone to care... why else would I write this? 

Tl;dr I'm having a rough year filled with sucide ideation especially this recent season.  Doubtful I'll get help based on past experience where things didn't go so well. Idk what to do and looking for support after my recent sucide attempt."
772,I don't know what to do anymore and im getting scared and psychotic,Im so scared that one day I will just end my life. I have depression and anxiety and they are always playing off of each other. I have tried three different anti-depressants and none of them have worked. I feel like every day I lose more and more of myself and I feel like im slowly going insane. I have a therapist but nothing I do works. I don't even know why im posting here I just need to talk to anyone
773,I don't think there's a way out,"I'm not happy anymore, or I have lost the ability to be happy again. My story is too long to tell. I feel that I'm a burden. I used to be a top student in undergrad, but now I'm pretty much screwed everything up in grad school. Besides school, I've been suffering chronic health conditions that I've tried everything within my ability but ended up giving up. People around me never knew how sad I am. They all thought that I'm a happy person, and they loved to be friends with me because they felt the positiveness from me. It's too painful to be alive. I'm not afraid of being dead. I'm terrified of ending up not dead. I'm still looking for a way to kill myself without too much pain. I want to make sure that I will die."
774,I’m tired,"I just want to leave, I’m scared of pain and I’m scared of death but I just want to leave. There’s no real reason why, I’m trans and that sucks but it’s not a reason for me to want to die, I have depression (seeing a professional and have been for 3 years). There’s no real reason and this feeling is just so selfish, my parents would grieve so much and it would effect a lot of people but right now that doesn’t matter to me and that’s so fucking selfish. What do I do?"
775,Suicide Watch in the Military,"Any Veterans with a similar experience? I remember suicide watch in boot camp and it was a humiliating experience for those who had to go through it - one of the reasons I never sought help when I was in.

I remember our DI bringing in a kid one night and telling us not to let him out of our sight. Whoever was on firewatch was responsible for his safety and if he tried anything all of us would feel the repercussions. To make sure the suicidal person didn't try anything, a group of people strapped him into his cot, and any time he needed to get up to use the head he had an escort with him. I also remember the DI giving us all a speech about growing a pair and not being weak, while standing next to the strapped down kid. I highly doubt this made him any less suicidal, and the experience scared me enough to never want to voice my own mental health concerns."
776,Please help me figure out how to make my life better without doing something drastic.,"I don't want to die. I truly don't. I just want this nightmare to end and can't figure out how to get that to happen. I feel trapped and am miserable. It's been this way for months. I'm going to go to sleep and hope tomorrow brings something better. 

That's what I've been doing for about 6 months now. Just going to sleep. Waking up and going through the motions. I am so incredibly miserable though. I hate my current life. I'm not safe and I'm far from happy. I want out but I feel so trapped."
777,Questions about an overdose,"I promise I'm not trying to poke any buttons. I'm really having some questions about the aftermath of an overdose and how someone else has dealt with it. 

Last year I overdosed on a medication that made me forget the entire event and a few days after it. I don't even remember doing. I have no idea what I said to people but I did apparently call someone who doesn't remember the conversation and can't give me any insight on what was going on that day. 

How do you deal with not remembering the thinking that you were thinking when you finally decided to do it. It driving me insane. I just feel like I need that tiny bit of explanation to get closure on it. I just want to remember why."
778,What’s the easiest and least painful way to commit suicide if no access to guns is available?,
779,"Got a B in another class, crushing my dreams basically.","I know in the context of the other stories mine is so small and stupid. Whatever. I’m still gonna kill myself over it.


I wanted to go do a MD/PhD program but my GPA was slightly below average, but nothing a semester of a couple As couldn’t fix. Then boom, got a B. GPA is now significantly below average for admissions. My boss is gonna be upset with me, I’m upset with me.


I can’t go on any longer."
780,Chronic illness,It's embarrassing for me to see everyone around me be productive with their lives while I'm confined at home because of my illness. I feel ashamed for being a neet.
781,Least painful way to die,What is The least painful way to die and Will god punish me for comitting suicide
782,"Reading through some of these posts and comments, you gotta stop and wonder, why do some people want to kill themselves, but dont want to see OTHER people kill THEMselves? Just a thought. I'm just like the rest of you people,and I hope we make it through this together, cause together is the only way",
783,After telling about my problems..,"I'm 16 and 2 weeks ago I had to write an german exam about my future. And I just couldn't think of something to write and I didn't wanted a bad grade (I know this is stupid) so I wrote that I wish that all this problems would stop. This got the teachers attention and she told it some staff of the school and since then my life just feels worthless everyday. And today was a day I had an exam and wasn't prepared for it because I didn't knew it was today. So I couldn't write very much and my day got completly ruined. Thats why I didn't go to school in the afternoon. And in the evening when my father came home and knew that I wasn't in school because of my GPS and yelled at me and just said that he is disappointed in me. And know I'm writing this text.



I'm a very bad writer especially in a other language but I just wanted to write this because I have the feeling if I don't. It's just gonna be to much for me and kill myself.

After writing this I feel like a completely idiot just don't roast me or something else negative please"
784,I can't,"I'm sick of my life.
I never have the courage to do it. I've been lying in my bed crying for about an hour.
Please help"
785,Feel like a complete failure,"Posting this because I feel like I have no one to go to. Just some background info ; 23M Chinese American. Currently in nursing school ( repeating a course ) and if I fail again I will be dismissed from the program. I’m basically on the verge of failing again and feel like there will be nothing left for me once I do. My parents constantly compare me to my siblings or other people’s children. ( who are all successful in their respective careers ). My mom especially would constantly on a daily basis go on rants on how useless I am , how fat I’m getting , and how come she couldn’t have someone else’s son as her child. When I ask her why she would say these things she would just reply with because I want you to better yourself. Well it doesn’t make me want to better myself. Everyday I’m constantly reminded about how much of a failure I am and how inadequate I am as a person. I haven’t told them that I’ve already failed a course and I’m about to be dismissed from the program due to the amount of shit talk I’ll have to experience afterwards. Just for reference , I’ve been to therapy before and have been on antidepressants but it did not help much because the home environment stayed the same so I decided there was no point of going to therapy and taking medications. I’ve seriously just considered ending it all within the next month , probably before my 24th birthday by MVA late at night.The only thing keeping me going right now are my friends whom I plan to hang out with a little more before I ultimately close the curtains."
786,Incapable of moving forward,"I've started this thread and then just before I wrote anything, I thought why would I do that. I remember many times in my life when I felt suicidal, I had this feeling in me that I needed someone's attention until probably today when I started to actively think of what I would actually do to kill myself.

But then... I think I am just lying to myself, since I'm writing here and hoping for something. I just know that I wouldn't write a suicide note and just in case in a dark forum as this one, maybe some things could be cleared up.

I've been having a gambling addiction over several years in my life. Despite the fact that I found a wonderful job as an online lecturer in natural sciences, then accepted by another company and currently in progress of being accepted for an additional job online, I would have problems gambling. Possibly because of isolation and loneliness back in my home.

A year ago, in December, I bought a trip to Thailand from my hometown in Europe for 2 weeks hoping to change something in my life and detach from everything. Despite all my problems and difficulties, on the second night of being there, I met my that time girlfriend, which changed me for a long time, made me ban myself from both live and online gambling places. I felt different and I felt it was changing me up to some time when I started to feel her being distant to me and disappointing me two times in a row which made me break up with her, regardless the fact that I came back here for 3 months after a short trip back home for 2 months. I started to feel isolated and all the good things in Asia seemed to be quite bad, I started to see reality, although I felt I had finally found a place I loved to live in.

I've been living here on regular visa runs to neighbouring countries for almost a year. Parallel to excessive wish to hang out, drink and meet someone real, I would also gamble and would always just live on the verge regarding my financial situation completely ignoring the fact that I'll have to do a visa run which will not necessarily work again. I realised that and I was more conservative and after meeting with a lot of great girls, I was just more upset than happy, as it was all just sex. I used to believe that it would make me satisfied, but the more girls I met, the more dissatisfied I was afterwards when it was over, which made me more and more depressed until the beginning of this month.

After being single for probably around 6 or more months, I've met a girl whom I truly liked and fell for completely, which is very rare to me. She showed genuine interest in me, but probably not her actions and secrets. I would just see her hanging out with her friend and random guys when she would actually tell me she was going to sleep etc., etc. It just made me tear inside. I went for more gambling simultaneously, as my vision of freedom, finally someone so close to me, was just an illusion. In the end, she just said she was not ready for relationships with anyone currently, and it was not my own problem, but still.

I am sitting in my room realising the New Year is coming having gambled off all my money and having only left several hundred dollars coming next week, having to move from here and do a visa run to come back. My birthday's in January, but it's going to be the most miserable time in my life. I feel like I don't want to come back home, I don't have friends, I don't keep contact with my parents, I don't have anyone real despite my online friends whom we chat sometimes but not get into personal life details.

I've been having dental issues, probably not very visible, but I can barely eat what I want, and this has been happening to me for over 3 years. I can only eat right side, as I have a suspicion that I probably have a fracture on my left molar, so I don't want to damage it. I eat conservatively, and sometimes it just hurts, I am in fear of getting any treatment, and now I'm even broke with no work for a month due to holiday seasons. I keep praying for faith, I'm not religious but I believe. But I just feel I cannot bear it anymore, for such a long time, I've been alone. And currently, when I don't have any means of getting some food at least, not to talk about going out, I just realize that no one even texts me or wants to know simply how I feel. It just hurts. I feel like sick, lost any hope of someone really being interested in me for not how I am, how I look like or what I have, but genuinely, exactly how I show interest in people, but it never happens to me, and I know what karma is. I feel like I deserve it, and I should change from the inside.

But I'm just too weak. I always had a strange vision that something will happen when I get 27. I've been researching suicide methods, but I'm afraid. Possibly of pain of doing this. The only thing I know that the experiences I had in my life, I'm not sure if I can get any more satisfaction of any of them, so I don't feel attached living here, no moral reasons would also stop me. But I don't feel strong enough to do it, regardless of how tired I am, and knowing that living this life might be even more painful."
787,Almost there,"I think I'll do it. I haven't talked to anybody about it (sometimes I tell suicide jokes, funny ones I think). I closed all my social media accounts, logged out of the forums I frequent, even I'm trying to sell everything from the hobby ive had since 2000. I'm trying to sleep all day taking pills (not to overdose, justo enough to sleep) and I think I'm ready. This past weekend I slept around 18-20h per day
Last summer we went on vacations, though about it when we were at the hotel. It was really high but didn't in the end (I thought about my wife, dying on vacations would have been shitty for her)
So far I haven't done it just for my wife, but I feel like I'm getting there
Obviously I have doubts, I'm trying to make a pros and cons list, what better place to start than black txt on a public forum"
788,TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO KILL THEM SELVES,the toaster in bath is the fastest and most painless
789,2020 will be my final year.,"Can't do it before then because of prior engagements, but I feel 2020 will be the year in which I die. 

I am just a broken person, and I don't think I can recover. I have tried though. From counselling to therapy to bootstraps to meds to philosophy to microdosing to Buddhism and other spirituality. I've pursued hobbies old and new, interests and passions and made big drastic steps. But I am not better. 

I cannot recover from this. I will never be better, and my definition of ""better"" is just me from 3 years ago, where I was still pretty ill. I was in a worse place in life, but my mind was better. 

I cannot get past my existential crises, I won't stop ruminating on my useless, wasted life. My stunted development. All my wasted potential. All my fears for the future. 

The big nail in the coffin for me is my rapid hair loss. I never had any success with my hair, and now that I'll be objectively unattractive it's all over. I won't ever experience the love and romance I've wished for my whole life. It will never happen. 

In a way, I'm thankful for my hair loss, it has really given me the push I finally needed to do it. 

I am too mentally ill, too bitter about existence. I hate the world too much and I hate myself even more. I am broken and I cannot be put together.

I turn 27 this month, and I hate that I'm going to be a cliché but I cannot bear to be a live another year. 

I will leave lots of people sad, perhaps irreparably devastated. But I cannot do this to myself, I need to be selfish and end it. My guilt is only temporary. 

My life, since about 14, has been a mission to find excuses to not kill myself. To distract myself of the logical conclusion of suicide. But now I have truly no reason not to do it, beyond staying and suffering for others. I do not want to suffer for much longer. 

I must settle my affairs, and I must die in 2020."
790,there is not a single person alive who gets it or can help,"long story brief, i'm severely mentally ill (schizoaffective, GAD, OCD, PTSD, the list goes on) and i've been living in a crisis program for almost 9 MONTHS (ridiculous) i'm about to move to a group home and restart school hopefully, and change usually sends me into a frenzy

instead of empathizing with me, the staff here will slyly call me attention seeking or ungrateful because i have asked to meet with them more often and have told them they're not able to help me. they're a bunch of assholes and i'm sick of being here. but it's either here or the streets. my family doesn't care and can't help support me either. called my mom out for mistreating me and she's ignoring me now.

they always tell you to 'reach out' and seek help, well i've gotten shit on so many times when i do, wether it's by professionals or family or friends. i can feel people are beyond tired of me. like honestly you think i fucking asked for any of this!? my mom always said that i ""have no quality of life."" she's right. i should just give up. i'm the only one who i can count on and my brain is too busy trying to kill itself and the body along with it.

i'm considering hanging myself or jumping off a bridge into the river. (it's winter so i'd drown/freeze) 
it feels like the only option."
791,I have no passion/happiness for/with anything.,"I am endlessly frustrated with myself because I don’t find joy in anything. I’m supposed to be enjoying my youth, but at 21, I find everything dull and am constantly bored. 

I’ve tried it all - instant and delayed gratification. I’ve tried every form of hedonism, but drugs fade away and lead to hangovers/rough “days after,” casual sex always leads to pregnancy anxiety (I’m a female, and I don’t want kids at any point), and food doesn’t taste like much at all. I’ve tried what seems like every therapy technique and medicine over the past ten years (with multiple therapists/psychiatrists),  too, and nothing has taken away the fact that I don’t enjoy anything. 

I thought that maybe pursuing something “lofty” would make me feel better, but it never did.  I held four jobs and got a 4.0 in college over 3 and a half years, and when I graduated yesterday, I thought that MAYBE I would feel some sense of accomplishment. Nope. Just boredom, flatness, and “this was a huge waste of time, just like everything else.” I showed a photograph in a gallery recently, too, and visiting the showing felt banal and purposeless. 

I can’t just lay in bed because I get too bored. I just get whatever I “need to do” done. There’s nothing driving me besides my own boredom and search to feel some sort of happiness/accomplishment, yet nothing I do is able to shake away how lifeless I constantly feel. Everything in my life has felt empty and passionless for as long as I can remember, and I carelessly thought that yesterday would change that. 

But nothing does, and I’m very tired of living. I just want this all to be over."
792,My sister is moving out. Can’t afford rent alone. I will off myself once she leaves,"Bc of my depression and nihilistic way of thinking, I’m not the best roommate. I have debilitating depression and anxiety. I don’t work that much bc of it. I can go on and on but I just need a plan on how to do it. My mother wants to put me in a mental hospital. I have no desire to get help. I’ve been trying to get help for almost a decade now. Idk why I’m posting this."
793,On the edge,"I’m desperate. It feels like my world is spinning out of control and I just keep throwing fuel to the fire. I’m sure my problems are petty compared to everyone else, but they are my own and they are real to me. 

Been married for 7 years. Found out in June (well, I knew “before”) that my wife was having an online affair with someone we call a friend. Oh the lies. That destroyed me. Fights have been constant. I can’t have just an argument. I always gotta find a deeper meaning than just an argument which makes things 10x worse. Wife is beyond attractive. I’m not a bad looking guy but I’m super insecure. Fight about men messaging her on Facebook. A lot. She doesn’t believe I can overcome my insecurities, doesn’t think I can change. Doesn’t believe in me changing what-so-ever. Drift further and further apart every day. Today is certainly one of those days. But yet she stays with me for whatever reason. 

Stuck in a dead end job with zero benefits, screwed as self employed. Only pittance is that I make decent money but is literal mental hell. Can’t quit because my wife and sons (two Labradors - call me crazy, whatever) rely on me as I make the lions share of the income. No health insurance. No access to any kind of mental help and the shit runs in my family unfortunately. Born crazy I guess. No luck in a multi year job search because I can’t take a cut in pay.  

No friends. No circle to reach out to. 

Not the first time I’ve been here. Tried at 14 and out of the thousands of shells I’ve shot hunting - shell was a dud. Just a deafening click. I got a lot better after that - had a new lease on life for a while. 

But here we are 18 years later again. Feel worthless. Feel like everyone, especially my wife, would be much happier without me. All I do is piss people off and start fights it seems. Always doing the wrong thing no matter how hard I try. 

Only reason I haven’t is because I love my dogs...they just wouldn’t understand. Don’t get me wrong - I love my wife - but at this point after the grief I’ve caused the past 10 years - don’t really think she’d give a shit. 

So many easy ways to do it. Know many places I could go where it would be weeks or maybe months before I was found. It’s all building up and pushing me to the edge. 

I don’t even know why I posted here. Another stupid thing. No one fucking cares."
794,Waiting for my clinic folder to be moved.,"I asked to the transfer of my clinic folder to another mental health institute. 
They said yes. Has been 1 month. And still nothing changed. 
What If I try to kill myself while I wait?"
796,A story about an addiction clinic... [hotline?],"Once, about a year ago, my girlfriend swallowed too many pills \[wasn't suicidal, just addicted\], and I wanted her to go to the hospital.

We compromised, called up a clinic to try and ask them about any signs we should look out for. \[And take her to the hospital if we see them\] The person on the other line said they'd send over a few people, then immediately hung up after saying they'd trace our number. \[after we told them it was fine.\]

Granted, we sounded young and confused, but weren't laughing or anything.

Called them up again, different person answered. The dude explained the other guy was just messing with us and straight up had no intention of sending people over. 

what. the. hell.

&amp;#x200B;

before anybody asks, my GF is fine, we're both fine. She saw a therapist a few days after it and has stopped with the pills, I'm proud of her despite this horrible experience."
798,Just got out of the psychiatric hospital,It was so horrible that I lied I am better just to get out. I’m still planning suicide. Haha. A patient kept on threatening me and those places are horrid.
799,"I didn’t want to offload on all of you folks again, but I had nowhere else to go","So I made a post on here somewhat recently, the night after I almost killed myself, and you guys had some awesome words of encouragement. I didn’t want to be “that guy” that continually posts about how shitty they are and throwing a pity party without actually improving. But here I am again, crying in the bathroom at work, debating booting out the door and into the path of an oncoming semi, and I have no idea where else to go. 

Since my last post, things have taken a downturn for me. I mentioned before that I felt like the odd one out in my own friend group, the one that had no idea how to make new friends and could barely interact normally with the ones I had. Now, I feel even more ostracized, but it’s my own damn fault. Every time I go out and socialize, every time I try to have a good time with other people, I somehow find a way to mess up, making it awkward for the rest of the event or just outright leaving out of shame (followed by thoughts of “you don’t deserve them, why do you hang out with them, you just drag them down”). Worse, my roommate, the one that I really felt comfortable around, transferred to a new school over 3 hours away. I didn’t think it would hurt as much as it does, but goddamn, losing the friend that felt like he understood everything, the one that *introduced me to literally everyone I interact with at my college*, fucking sucks. Knowing him, he’s not the type to keep in touch either; he’ll move on, and I’m back to feeling like the one that doesn’t belong in the friend group. In addition, I feel starved for intimacy, but have never even held a girl’s hand, let alone been in a relationship. How can I possibly expect to improve in that regard, though, given where I am now, mentally?


I also mentioned that I don’t even feel comfortable sharing this stuff with my own family. My mother, who I’ve always butted heads with for various reasons, insisted that nothing was wrong the last time I tried to talk about it, going into a yelling fit about “how I shouldn’t be depressed” (I’m not medically diagnosed, and I don’t want to self-diagnose or anything like that, but it’s a strong possibility, more on that later), “just look at how great your life is”. My dad isn’t a very empathetic person, and it’s hard to go to him for support since he sees it all as an excuse for laziness. 

Speaking of laziness, I’ve hit a point where everything seems impossible, like I’m too lazy for life. Trying to lose weight and not be a fat piece of shit has failed yet again, efforts to improve socially have led to feeling like a failure of a person, attempts at a better sleep cycle and improving my organizational and general living habits get dropped within days. Even my attempts at seeking professional help have failed; I managed to speak to a school counselor, who gave me the contact information to some local therapists that could help me, but I haven’t had the willpower to pick up the phone and call. The best way I can describe all this is with an analogy: it’s like I took a shit on the floor, then sat in it. I know that the situation sucks, I don’t want to be in it anymore, and I can improve it with minimal effort, but instead I continue to wallow.  I feel like happiness is something I, with my lackluster self and minimal drive to make something of myself instead of being a burden on others, don’t deserve. As such, what’s left other than to find some way to end it, to stop being such a needy, unappealing social parasite on the people I care about?


Before, there were a total of two people that I felt I could trust, the only two people that I could tell about my deteriorating mental state: my childhood friend and my older half-sister. Now, my friend has stopped talking to me at all, with attempts to hang out or strike up conversations being met with one word responses. Meanwhile, my sister (who lives thousands of miles away as-is) has had to deal with way too much of my bullshit. She’s a busy lady, with her own struggles in life, and I can’t possibly burden her with my troubles anymore. 


In short, I feel more and more alone in the world, but I also know that it’s my own fault. I thought that I could feel better in my last post, that I could aspire to feel better in my own skin, to be a better friend and person, to be *normal*. Now though, even that feels unattainable, and all that’s left is to be miserable because I can’t even take the first steps at *not* being this way. I’m sorry, I don’t mean for this to be a pity party or anything like that, nor do I want to burden some random stranger on Reddit yet again with my personal baggage. I’m just here, at the end of my rope, not sure if I can go on for much longer before I do something drastic."
800,Asking for advice and support,"Hello there. I am depressed with suicidal ideations and self-harm episodes and I am not sure what to do next. It is not clear to me how to get support and get better.

There is nothing in life to justify my depression. I am young and healthy (physically), I am married to the person I love, we have two healthy and happy children. My job usually brings me meaning and satisfaction and also pays well. We are stable financially and we have not experienced any traumatic events in a long time. So on paper I should be the happiest person alive. 

But I am just not doing well. Most of the time I am hurting inside and crying. My anxiety is at the highest it has been and I feel very depressed. I do think often that ending it all could be the answer, but thinking of what it would do to the kids stops me. However, when I am in complete agony, I can't control myself. Lately I have been taking a heavy boot and smashing my head with it. It leaves big bumps and a headache, but that pain is far less than what hurts on the inside. I am running out of stories to explain those bumps at work... 

The biggest thing that triggers me is my relationship with my husband. We both suck at communicating. He does not take my struggles seriously and tells me that I should be able to control myself. And I can't.... My cry for help is usually a long speech on how some of the things he does hurt me (ex.: trips he takes  - for work and fun, leaving me by myself with the kids and my job, including during big holidays and birthdays, including when I told him I can't manage my mental state). He views my complaints as an attack (which probably is, since it's a wall of emotionally-charged criticism). But I can't help it, I get flooded with emotion and go on and on trying to explain to him how I am hurting. He gets super defensive and often starts yelling at me. His screaming is the worst thing ever for my mental state....

It's not just the relationship with him though. My mother lives with us and that relationship is not going well. I have a lot of resentment towards her back from my childhood (I believe that her ways of raising me contributed to my inability to ever accept myself and contributed to my tendency to be constantly anxious). She is eager to give advice or criticize and I cannot take it - I get very very irritated and dismiss her, which hurts her. When I try to open up to her she usually talks about how so many people have it so much worse and they are doing fine and so should I. Actually the most common thing my husband and my mom say is ""so what do you want *me* to do?"" when I tell them I am at a breaking point.

Other things trigger me too, some of them are silly. My young kid lied to me about candy, and it upset me so much that I sobbed in bed ""I am a failure, I raised a liar and there is not future for our relationship"" and want to stop existing. Work has been bad too, even though usually it's the last standing anchor in my life...

I also cannot eat when I am in this state, so I have been losing weight rapidly and my BMI is already under 18. I am not starving myself to get skinny, I just can't swallow food and never feel hungry at all. Or rather, the feeling on emptiness in my stomach makes me feel less helpless, even though it makes little sense. 

What help can I get? 

**Friends and family.** Clearly my family is not being understanding. I have three close friends who would get how serious this is, but I can't tell them as they have enough trauma. One lost her farther to suicide, the other one has a suicidal 10 year old, and the third friend has been dealing with suicidal husband, poverty and a special needs child. Usually *I* am the support person for them, not vice versa. Others in my life would act just like my family does, they would say ""just try to be more positive"" or ""you need to relax"" or ""you are a horrible mother for having those thoughts"". 

**Therapy**. Well, I am talking to a therapist on Dr. On Demand app. She is sweet, but I am afraid to tell her how badly I am doing. I don't know how to find a good in-person therapist. I tried a bunch in my area (the number is in high 20s - low 30s) and never had any luck outside of two absolutely brilliant therapists who raised the bar very high. They both moved away and I just can't go through one more try...

**Medication**. Early this year I took Zoloft and it did very little for me, but getting that prescription made it close to impossible to get an affordable life insurance policy. I promised myself to stay away from medication to get a quote next year, as I am not sure it works on me and I want to re-apply for life insurance. Because if I get hit by a car, it would be very hard for my husband to support the kids on his own, as I generate over 60% of our income.

What else can I do? It seems that if I had just one supportive person around me, it would help a ton, but I don't... To be honest, even writing this long rant here made it feel a little better. It is for the first time that I am open and honest. The throwaway account makes it less scary. 

**To summarize: From the outside I am a mean aggressive depressed person who has a sweet life, but instead of appreciating it, I want to kill myself. Others don't think I deserve unconditional support, and I probably agree with them - I do not.**"
801,"Never been so close, and somehow don't care. I just don't want any more life.","Husband and father. I have epilepsy, severe anxiety, and obviously depression. I have been told by several neurologists that I am not a candidate for anti depressants for various reasons I don't care to get into. Same for anxiolytic drugs. I don't have any friends. I don't have a career, even a job. 
I don't know what to do. I have no purpose. Lately I'm a shit father, the one thing I never wanted to be. There is nothing I want from life, and my seizures, anxiety, lack of prospects or purpose all make life unbearable.
My body is sore and battered from convulsions as if from car accidents. I'm almost completely unemployable. It's near impossible for an epileptic to receive disability for some reason. The number of things society or insurance companies say I cannot do or won't allow is astounding. My family struggles to get by.
Epileptics kill themselves very frequently. The condition and meds are awful, you are robbed of agency, autonomy and freedom. People often treat you like an idiot. They make jokes at your expense. 
I have nothing to look forward to. Being a father is not enough, one day my kids will leave. I thought I could make it that far at least. Lately I think why do that to a young adult with responsibilities, it may be better at a very young age. Their mother may even move on and find someone that can be supportive in all the ways I haven't been able to.
I'd rather none of this happened. I'd rather I were normal or healthy or had never been born.
I doubt this post will change a goddamn thing."
802,None of it is real today,Everything is empty and it’s al fading away
803,how do i make a change?,"i wake up every morning dreaming of my own death. i hate myself. i am a bully because i am so miserable. i have become an alcoholic to cope with my negative feelings. i stay out drinking because i don't want to be alone. i don't want to sleep because that means i have to wake up alone again. i have pushed away everyone good in my life and surrounded myself with other alcoholics. i hide from my family because i feel so much shame. i have run up $10,000 in credit card debt because i can no longer stop myself from spending hundreds of dollars every week buying myself and others drinks. i also work as a bartender and got shitfaced while i was working last night. i am lucky i still have my job. i just couldn't cope. before work, i sat with a knife at my wrists and sobbed so loudly i am sure the whole block heard. the insane part is that my debt saved my life in that moment. the thought of my fathers disappointment upon finding out about my debt stopped me. he saved enough money to send me to college for a degree i don't use. i realized killing myself would expose how poorly i've managed my life. i am alive so i can keep pretending. anyway, i eventually pulled it together and left for work. i felt so horrible that i started taking shots as soon as i got there. i am so fucking stupid. not only was i stealing from the bar but i ended up so drunk i couldn't do my job. i should've been fired. i may end up losing my job anyway if my money is off. i can't even remember counting the register.

i am writing this because i woke up hating myself again. i woke up alone on my couch with the thought of suicide. i woke up thinking of how i sabotaged myself last night because i was too afraid to die. i just want to be different. i don't want to wake up feeling like this anymore. i want to make a change but it feels impossible. i keep trying to stop drinking but then i inevitably break and end up shitfaced and doing things i regret. how do i make a change? i don't have an ounce of willpower left. i cannot see any future for myself outside of killing myself. i am a selfish, self pitying, hateful person. i guess i'm writing this because i realized this morning that if i am not going kill myself i have to change. i just don't believe in myself enough or trust myself enough to think progress is realistic. i don't know what to do. 


sorry this is a bit of a rant. i am just going to post before i change my mind. i need help and i have no one to turn to."
804,I need to do it but I don't want to hurt my family even more,"I've never been so close to actually just doing it.
I need to I can't live with this guilt and how I will and already disappoint them. I know they will be devastated but I just can't look them in the eyes and know how they don't want me anymore.
I'm in my pitch black room waiting for courage and the right way to do it.
It's just more than my psyche can take."
805,Scared for tonight,Ive been suicidal for about a year now and haven’t been able to get much help. I have severe depression and have been on several antidepressants to no avail. I have chronic migraines where I get around 2 a week which makes school pretty difficult. My dad is abusive but my mom has tried to help me through this. I already know how I’m gonna do it but I don’t know when I’m going to. I have finals this week and I think I’d be better of dead. Most of my friends hate me because I always seem so down. I don’t know what to do except I think killing myself would be best. Thanks for any help.
806,fuck. it’s even more depressing when people can’t give you concrete reasons that you should keep living.,"i’m so fucking sick of people going “we gotta just keep pushing” or “this is just temporary” or any of that bullshit. i’m so sick of all these flowery phrases that maybe work for those who are mildly depressed but don’t hold water for those who are deep in it. 

WHY do i have to keep pushing? i’ve BEEN pushing for decades. why am i fucking doing this. 

and it isn’t temporary. my pain has been growing for as long as i can remember. i hate existing. i’ve tried many, many things to feel better. meds, therapy, life changes, etc. 

i’m the type of guy who looks like he has his shit together from the outside but i just want it to end. i would be so thankful."
807,i don’t know if i will see 2020,"it’s getting tiring to just always fight the suicidal thoughts.
i’ve been having them for now 14 years. every single day.
people around me don’t really understand. i have been diagnosed with bpd and my psychiatrist tells me nothing can help me. people around me say medication is the easy way. it feels like nobody wants to help me yet nobody wants me to go. isn’t it selfish? to want people to stay in their misery and not helping whatsoever but preventing them to go what that’s literally all that they want? 
idk... idk what to do. i don’t know if i will be able to see 2020, even if i will see next week.
i’m just too done to fight anymore."
808,Searching for help,"Hello, I don’t know if this is the right subreddit but I can’t find a better one.
I moved to a new country one year ago and found a friend. He was the only person I really considered a friend. We were hanging out, doing all kind of stuff. To make it short, he was the only person I had, but he decided to kill himself. I don’t know how to react or what to do now I’m just searching for any bit of help, because I actually can’t live without him. If you know any method that could help me getting over it, please let me know"
809,I'm an awful human being who hurt the person they love the most.,"I put my SO, the person I love the most in a really bad mental state and they might break up with me soon.


I'm awful. I'm devastated. I'm awful."
810,Help,Anyone (preferably over the age of 35) free for an open and frank conversation via DM please?
811,Way to go,"Why not take a bunch of pills, and drive on the free way and hit a pole, or drive into a retention pond??"
812,I wish you could see me now . I'm no coward I've held on for years.,"What's the point. It's too late to stand up or improve for myself.  I'm alone, trapped in a toxic work environment, no social life .  I feel dying is my only escape. I just want some relief. Every morning I try but how much can you do . I'm so tired.. I just want relief. 
Every time I try to have a life. It gets upturned. I get dumped , move away. Every time I try to work in my job I get yelled at. 
What else is there. 

10 YEARS I HAVE HELD ON.  how much more can I take"
813,Lol it got worse.,"So like I’ve been kinda spiraling. Lol I didn’t think it’d get this bad. I need help but idk what to do lol. 
I was cutting today. Never tried that before. I always say I’m not gonna kill my self. I figure I won’t do it it never seemed like it has but I guess the hopelessness is getting worse. I feel on edge kinda panicky I’m gonna go smoke more. I might just be overreacting. I’m doing this to myself it’s my fault. I mean I’m making these decisions. Over and over. And I don’t seem to learn either. So why do I get upset. I don’t have the right to I’m doing this to myself. If people help it doesn’t matter. I don’t can’t or wont change. Either way Idk anymore my minds blank now I’m tired."
814,I want to end it with no pain in the process. .,
815,Thinking a bottle of 3 different meds I have may work.,I’m tired of being told everything is always my fault! I feel like a failure! I’m due to start my masters degree in January but honestly dk what to do! I started cutting after being clean for 7 months. I don’t really have any local friends to do things with. No one to talk to (because one user who has friended me and we’ve been chatting).  I’m stressing about providing Christmas for my kids and then the day after is one is their birthdays so I’m just so stressed! Some days I feel physically sick I’m stressing so much!
816,My GF died in the hospital after her suicide attempt.,"I need help moving on, I've tried to/thought about committing suicide 2 times in the last 2 days. I need help. My mental health was alright before this, Im just broken, it's unreal, I want to push a knife into my stomach because it feels like it's my fault."
818,I'm too weak to stay on this earth,"I'm already so depressed and have self steem issues and I feel like everytime I hear about racism or bigotry of any kind it just makes me want to kill myself even more. This world is so fucked up and I'm too weak. 
Anyways, Ending it all is just what is meant to be for me I guess. Dont have any friends. I dont have good looks, I dont have talents,I dont have a nice personality. Everyone thinks im a weirdo. I'm worthless and you guys would probably dislike me irl as well. After all I've got nothing to offer"
819,Suicide Hot-line.,"Ok I just want all of your opinions. Why is it that every other post on this subreddit is talking about how the suicide hot-line has told them to pretty much kill themselves? I have not gotten to the point where I would call them, but other people have reached out for help and the helpers/employees  just shit on these people that want help. Is there anything we can do to make it a necessity to have training? It makes me so angry that the government just allows pretty much anybody in and doesn't help them understand where we are coming from. Some of these people are just assholes to the bone and even if they did have training they would still be horrible for the job. I feel like it needs to be run more as a business in a way that they only hire the right people who actually care and not the ones that just want the social credit. What do you guys think we should do about it?"
820,I’m so fucking exhausted of wanting to kill myself all the time,"Feeling like a worthless piece of garbage. Thinking about how awful I am and how abhorrent the universe finds me. I can’t even drink or smoke to relax without it biting me in the ass. Killing myself is the only way out. It just wants to wear me down more and more until I finally do it. Well fuck, I’m getting pretty exhausted now and I really don’t want to do this any longer."
821,I reached my goals and became happy and build a stable life. But I still dont want to live for another 50 years of ups and downs.,"I had a crippling depression and no will to live a few years ago. I climbed out of that hole and build a life for myself. I found new hobbies and became much more active and build a lot of habits.

My life is actually awesome right now and I basically got to a point I could only have dreamed of.   
I did what I felt I needed to do to get rid of the depression, but somehow my will to live hasn't returned. I just don't enjoy being alive even though I am very happy right now. It just feels like a neverending chore with some happy moments sprinkled within.

But now I feel like I am a rollercoaster wagon that went up the rails very slowly and is about to go for a wild ride downwards. 

I really have no more goals in life right now and am so happy. I set myself up for a great career and my music hobby is going off too, but I just dont get it. I kind of just want to quit while on top. 

And it feels like such a stupid crazy thought, but I just dont want to go through lows and highs for another 50 years.  
this is not a spontaneous thought either, I have been thinking about this for a few weeks now, because I am so happily in love and feel like it just cant actually get better than this.

I am so confused."
822,I’ve just taken a load of Xanax and heroin,Will update if I survive
823,Having a hard time getting over a breakup. Desperately need advice.,"We were together for about 3 years. And now we have been apart for more than that.
I think about her often, a few times a day every day. If there's a lot going on  and I'm generally stressed about life and not thinking about her during the day, often times I will still dream about her.

I know thats kinda normal immediately after a breakup, I don't know what ""normal"" is, a few weeks? Maybe a couple months of being sad about it if it was a long term relationship?

It's been over 3 years since I've talked to her. I completely removed any reminders of her from my life. No social media, no mutual friends I talk to anymore, I have moved to a new town since then, I've dropped out of school, I have even deleted all the music that I listened to during that time of my life. There is literally nothing. Nothing that should even faintly remind me of them. Yet I cannot get them out of my head.

What's wrong with my brain.

I'm going to delete this soon because I was too lazy to make a throwaway"
824,so tired,"been sleeping earlier every night imagining my reality isnt real, still, the empty throb of my pain wakes me every morning. 

am such a failure in academics. there is nothing in my life worth fighting for. my existence is shame embodied and given nourishment, burgeoning out the confines of my weak will. 

what have i lived till this moment for? and why? just to be debris propping up the elite. the contrast to a success story, so their courage and intelligence stands out starkly against the wilted and wasted monstrosity that is me.

everyone i have ever mentioned this too has brushed it off as teenage angst. part of me wonders if it’s the brat in me acting up attention. 

whatever it is, i’m tired"
825,Grim reaper come get me mother fucker,Just fucking end me.   Fucking end me.   Fuck this life.   It's over for me.  Fucking end me God.   Come get me death I'm fucking done with this evil fucked life full of evil fucked people that deserve to fucking die. I go through wanting to kill myself all day long or kill the fucking evil fucking piece of shit that turned my life into this unlivable fucking nightmare that just cant be resolved.  I fully understand why people snap and do unthinkable shit anymore.  Fully fucking understand it.   Take this life u put in me back God just fucking end me or kill the one that ruined me and my whole fucking existence.  More like murdersuicidewatch wheres that forum that's where I should be posting.
827,I deserve to die but dont have the balls to actually do it,"i dont deserve to waste any more air but i cant bring myself to actually do it, any help would be appreciated

&amp;#x200B;

im not really sure what to say but to summarise why I want to - im awful at everything, a total dissapointment to everyone around me thats a drain on society, ive destroyed every group of friends I have ever been in, and theres no reason I should continue to be a waste of space"
828,I’m scared I might kill myself,"Hi I’m f15 and I’m super sorry if this isn’t allowed but I wish I was dead, I don’t wanna tell my therapist because if I tell her how much I want to kill myself i might be hospitalized and I can’t have that my parents can’t know because they think I’m a lot better than I actually am. I also can’t because finals are tomorrow and I’m so scared like terrified because I wanna keep living cause I know it can get better because it has gotten better but I just feel like maybe it won’t this time. I really wanna kill myself. I try to tell people and reach out for help and they always make fun of me cause, well, I’m 15, and all the “depressed Billie eilish girls faking depression “ and I don’t know if I can survive for much longer I need help"
830,So i decided to took my own life this week,"first of all sorry for my bad english

i don't even remember when i laugh when i become happy and when i had a purpose on life

i quit talking and meeting with my friends about 4 years ago only friends i have on the internet

im anti social gaming addict im on drugs but i don't think im addict i only smoke weed maybe once in a 3 months

i dropout highschool when im 16 because i knew im not gonna live long ( im 20 years old now ) so i decided to live a little 

bit better life until im gonna die i fucking sit and played games for 4 fucking years only worked 3 months and quit job 

because it was 12 hours for a day i don't have any plan for my life now i don't want to get married and live with shitty 

salary so where i live is you have to go to the military for 6 months when you hit 20 years old if you don't have to go to 

school you can't delay it so i don't wanna go to the military either i decided to took my own life this week i think im gonna 

jump into the train because its very close the where i live but still open for ideas and im pretty sure thats gonna happen

please don't try to change my idea its not gonna work thanks."
831,Kill me,WHY WONT ANYONE HELP ME???? Why are you all so evil???
832,I've never been this close to killing myself,"I guess it's just a matter of time now. Nothing feels good. I have friends, but few of them are actually nice, most of them don't even notice me. I have hobbies, but the problem is that I don't have the motivation to drive to them. Neither do they spark any joy in me anymore. No motivation for school. The only real friends that I have are my friends only because we drink a lot sometimes.

My life is full of heartbreaks, hard times and me messing up things that were supposed to be fun. When there is a better moment in my life, it will end soon, either to a heartbreak or me messing up something else. 

Last nail to the coffin was last week. problems within family, being almost literally air to other people in school. On top of it all, girl who I had something going on with, said that she can't go on because of my past mistakes and girls. I guess none of those past ""girlfriends"" were actually love, it was just for comforting me. All the actual people that I could've spent my whole life with do not notice me, I'm not sure if they even remember I exist. 

I'm not good at talking so I haven't really talked to anyone about my problems. I don't think anyone would be interested. I can't talk to my mom or dad, I just couldn't, for reasons. Also when I think of people whose life is going much worse than mine, it feels embarrassing to whine when nothing is really wrong. It's just that nothing feels fun anymore. I hardly got myself into writing this text but it was easier than talking. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Any tips are appreciated, either to make things better or fast ways to take my life."
833,I don't want to be another percentage.,"So many trans people kill themselves. I never really understood why until I realised I was trans myself. It's so hard for most of s=us. Being in a body you don't belong in, being called a name you don't want. I was already a depressed, anxious and self-loathing person, but after realising this aspect of my life, that's only amplified. 

I'm not saying this as anything against being transgender. It's easy to listen to trans people talking about how hard it can be and assume that it's a mistake, or it's not worth it. 

It's just hard when you know that your parents and family are gonna make your life so much more difficult when they find out. And I can't keep it a secret forever. 

I think about all of the things that are going to become so much more complex once I come out and begin transitioning. New medication, new clothing, makeup, more things to worry over and do. I just want to be me. But I can't be me without judgement. And that's killing me.

This is might be incomprehensible to read so you know sorry if you did read all of this. I feel more comfortable talking about trans stuff on here as I've read a few other posts from trans people on this sub and I don't remember there being a negative reaction... But maybe there's just good moderators. 

But yeah. I think about killing myself everyday. And if I do, I'll just be another percentage. And do I want that?"
834,"I want to help, but I don’t know how.","I do t know this sub very well, so I hope I’m not being rude or insensitive, but it’s exactly as the title says. I want to help people who feel like they have no other option to keep them from taking their own lives. But I don’t know how to help without sounding cheesy or insensitive. To those who have convinced others or to the people who have actually been convinced to keep going, what worked best? What didn’t work?"
835,I want to end it all,"I [17M] have been going through depression but I can’t seem to open up to anyone. I pushed my ex-girlfriend away because she tried helping me and my lack of communication just didn’t let me open up to her, I can’t even open up and talk to my parents or a therapist. I feel alone and want to end it all, I pushed almost all the people who mean something to me away. I have trust issues and it’s so hard venting to anyone. I don’t know what to do but lately i’ve just been thinking I have nothing to lose so why not end it all 😓"
836,I just want this all to be over with,"For a long time I thought I wanted to die but fear of the unknown still consumed me. Now, it doesn't phase me at all. I just want this hell to end. Everyday is suffering and it's been this way for years. My ""family"" who have the resources to help me don't care enough to do anything. 

I gave up believing in god so long ago. There is no higher power, there is no karma, we're just tiny specks of dust in a world that is completely indifferent to our existence. Actually, it seems that the more ruthless you are the more you'll succeed in life. 

If anyone sees this and resonates with it, man I really feel for you. I hope things get better for you, I really hope you can find some peace and go on to live a fulfilling life. As for me, my time has come."
837,I'm not sure if I'm going to make it to 30,"Either through my bad physical health or through mental anguish...I do not think I am going to make it to 30. Work and family life is going so bad now. Everything is expected of me but I feel like I'm failing every step of the way. It doesn't help that I work with family as well, if I fail, they fail. I can't escape because it's expected of me to take over, I discussed leaving before but I was told that was not an option without disappointment and awkward family gatherings. I'm just tired of it all, I feel worthless, I have no skills, nowhere else to go. I just put on a smile every morning and cry at night. There's a gun store down the street from me. Every time I feel like this I think about how easy it would be to get one and then drive off into the middle of nowhere. There I couldn't inconvenience anyone and it will be over. I've just been so tired for so long..."
838,0 to 100 just that quick.,"All it takes for me these days is one argument. A few insults. A bad event.

That’s all it takes for me to get triggered into thinking about all the possible ways there are to kill my self. Why I’d be better off dead. The feeling of absolute anxiety, dread, fear, and depression that makes me want to not breath anymore. 

If life is always going to be like this, I think I’m too weak for this life. I’d be better off gone. 

I’m. Tired. This. Hurts. Living. Hurts."
839,I don’t know what to do,"I have to make a really difficult decision. Which is absolutely impossible for me, altough it might sound stupid for others. I ve been all right for 3 months know, after about 3 years of depresion. In the last year I faild to kill myself twice. And now, I just feel like the only way out is to jump off the window."
840,Earlier tonight I cut my wrist pretty deep but it didn’t hit the artery and stopped bleeding,Then I drank a little and listened to wont back down and cried and now I’m with my dog but idk if I should call out today or what to even do with life. Merry Christmas
841,I have two days left.,In two days it’ll all be over and I can’t wait.
842,Turning 18 in 2 and a half weeks. Why am i still here?,"The only career path i ever wanted to do is now impossible. I don't care for any other jobs, i just wanted to work as a cop. I wanted to help.. but now from my own demons legally i am unfit mentally to join. I refuse to work just because i have to, i want to do what i like doing but no no, guess I'll die. When? Who knows doubt i could do it again but i want to. Being Autistic makes living almost impossible and doing simple tasks is like an exam each time. 

Please let me die, please break into my house and stab me. Give me cancer or something. I WANT DEATH."
843,I’m not sure what to do,"So I’ve been thinking about suicide a lot in the second half of this year and every time remembering my loved ones helped but I’m afraid that one day it won’t help anymore. I enjoy life sometimes but it’s so hard most of the time. I don’t know what I’m doing. I skipped a lot of school and I’m scared that I’ll be kicked out. 
I get good grades (well try to get good grades) but I don’t think that would stop them. Honestly, I wouldn’t blame them for wanting to kick me out for my attendance... I know it’s bad but I really can’t control it. I just feel so lost. I’m not sure why should I go to school. The only idea that pops up in my head is that I should go to get good grades, so that I can go to a good university and later on get a good job so that I could earn money and live happily. Seems like a very basic plan but it does not motivate me at all. It seems pretty pointless to me since I don’t even know what I want to do and the thing I always thought I wanted to do is a bit impossible because of this one thing I’m not willing to share publicly. 
I’m not sure if I’m just lazy or is it my mental health acting up but I’m feeling tired. What’s even worse is that most people don’t understand me. One time my favourite teacher told me that I’m simulating and it hurt me more than I’m willing to admit since at the time I was going through a ruff time with my family problems. Then I realised that even intelligent people, that I look up to, wouldn’t understand me and I can’t really blame them since I know how it could look from someone else’s perspective.
I’m not sure why I’m writing this here. Maybe I need to talk to someone, maybe I need advice, maybe just to endure this until my next therapy appointment since sadly from research I know what I would have to do. I hope I will never be bold enough to take my life since I know I would hurt a lot of people who I love but the scary truth is that it seems that I need only a small push now and I will do something that I would have regretted later if I was still alive."
844,What are some medicines that can cause amnesia?,"  
I have been thinking about how I won't be sad about certain things that happened with me anymore if I just lose my memory. I guess I'm looking to discuss if there are some medicines that can cause that effect where you get amnesia and lose the memory of that stuff happening with you at all?"
845,Hit by a subway,"Hi ! The 1st october I decided to kill myself, so I throw up myself on the subway when he arrived at the station. I just remember running and jump. I woke up at the hospital, I was broken but alive. I had my arm broken, my hip too, i had facial nerves dead, sutures at the head, and a lot of little injury. At the first time i was « fuck I mnot dead » at the second time I was like « I want to live ! Let me walk !! »"
846,I may have to end my suffering and pain,"I dont have much to live for, everyone around me are doctors and I am not. I feel like a total failure I dont want to really live. I started university when I was 23 no hope or anything and no future. I'm just gonna end up living in a minimum wage job and something that's not intellectually challenging."
847,Bye.,"I'm tired of feeling this way everyday, the amount of heartache I feel just by living is too much for me to handle. I sent a goodbye to him, something to his friend asking him to tell him I love him and to give him a hug for me. Then I also sent something to his new girl, telling her to treat him well. 

Now I'm just listening to the playlist he made me when we were together, getting ready to put the things I want sent back to him in a box."
848,It took me to long to type this.,"Hi reddit. I’m starting to scare myself. I’ve had mild depression since grade 8 but now at 28 its started to escalate. Things don’t interest me the way they used to so I’ve been trying to escape myself as often as possible. I truly love my life and the people in it however the thought of escaping has graduated into a new frontier that’s gaining momentum. To be honest I’m writing this because I’m to afraid to call the hotline. Even if I did call I’d feel as if I was talking time from another person. I’m even more terrified to confide in my family because they’d take my failures as their own. I’m caught between hell and a hard place. I feel as if any action I do is only going to backfire. I don’t feel as if I can express myself without having it be interpreted as a nuisance. I had a s/o but my behavior drove her away. Our lease expires in a month and she doesn’t trust any thing I do. I’ve no doubt that she still cares about me but it’s difficult to believe that when all of our friends as well as my employer seems to know intimate details about my life that I’ve never shared and have altered their behavior because of it. I don’t know what to do, or who to call, or what to say. This can’t be what life is about, and if it is, escape seems like a more than fitting term."
849,CONSTANT,"Ive had constant suicidal thoughts all day everyday for years now. Mostly is just there and i feel nothing from it and whatever, but sometimes it gets intense where i feel i could act out on them. Is that somewhat normal to think about it that much when your depressed, or is even that too fucked up?"
850,I’ve mentally given up,"I didn’t study for my finals, pretty much guaranteeing at least one failed class for the semester. I stopped caring at work - I haven’t showered in days, I stopped caring about makeup and just try and get out of bed. People ask me about Christmas and the new year and I don’t plan on being alive to see it. I was going to die tomorrow after work but I remember I took a longer shift and can’t now. It looks like Thursday might be the day. I’m done with living."
851,Goodbye,"Too many things has built up with my friend being the breaking point.  Getting beat and yelled at by parents.  Being isolated ar school.  I just want to go away. Ive been planning this for a long time.  I feel bad,  I know other people in the world have it way worse.  But it's not like im hurting anyone,  nothing is gonna happen when I go. My mom is currently yelling and slapping my sister.  When she leaves for work I'm walking out and going to where I planned. I don't know if it'll be good but it'll be better than living.  Goodbye"
852,I'm giving up,"Im 15 and i have no friends, my used to be friend group decided to put another's persons problem over mine and not care about my problems which lead me to have major trust issues, I suffer from anorexia and every time I think I'm going to overcome it, I go back to it again. I'm also doing badly in school because I can't concentrate and in every break, I hide in the bathrooms and cut myself."
853,Anti-depressants,"So, I’ve been feeling suicidal for years probably and it’s peaked around this time because of getting mentally abused by my boss. I didn’t know how to deal with it so I took an anti-depressant (were not mine btw were my dads) and I’m having bad withdrawal symptoms idk. Idk how to cope with them idk what to do but I’m panicking"
854,Life isn’t worth it anymore,"I’m fucking worthless nothing I do is successful. I’m broke my grades are at an all time low and I have no fucking clue on how to get out of this bottomless pit of self hatred, regret, and failure. 
Please somebody help me"
855,self hatred i want to end it all,"i can't change it
i can't get back who i've lost 
i can't change my mistakes
i can't change things i've said

i hate myself i can't live with myself"
856,Yeah my attempt to not suicide today - But I don't think i'll succeed HELP ME PLEASE,"I have been suicidal for a while now, it comes and goes. Although the first time I tried was back in 2012, I swallowed shitload of medicines, paracetamols, 2 fist full of them, but I didn't have long lasting effects (that I know of), i was okay in 2 days. I cut myself a lot back then, did it this year too but a lot less because it doesn't help anymore.. Long story short, I have had a very rough year, ranging from insecurities, being bullied, harassed, pushed around like a puppet, picked on and have had my family turn against me, heck I've even had my heart shattered into a million pieces..by that I literally mean shattered. Still recovering though, all these events that folded made me insecure and made it hard for me to trust any one, some days I feel like I can trust my best friend the most and some days I feel like I can't. Imagine trusting someone so much and having stomped on..the effect lasts long. I have had argument with another of my friend who was a really good friend..he became a jerk when I told him I couldn't lend him the money when he asked me for it.. He used to be so fucking nice..and I can't even imagine he would be so abusive. After all the times we've helped each other out. People don't realize the long last effects their actions can have on others. I have written 2 suicidal notes on my laptop throughout the past few weeks, no one knows about it - just me. I won't go into the details about just how all the events folded this year, but know that I am normally a very soft and caring person, I blame myself for being born this way, I abso-fucking-lutely loathe myself, I've failed in 2 businesses I started. Working on 3rd one now.. Heck I didn't even manage to graduate my high school and the regret lingers on, it sometimes makes me wonder if my girlfriend sees me as a failure too? Because my parents sure do. Of course I am not here for any sympathy from any one. I am simply not worth it. Of course people feel sad sometimes, but they have people to talk to, and they can. I can't I physically can't, I feel lonely and I go into solitude just because I don't want to hurt anyone with my ill mouth. I feel like a burden on everyone close to me with constant problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had this gush of feeling that sent me spiraling down this lane. It's not one of ""those"" days where I feel like I'm ok and the next moment I feel suicidal. Those days are still controllable but today if different, I feel so much rage especially with everything that's going on around the world. There is no sign of humanity and love left. Know this that I am not that person who takes suicide lightly, so know this I am not fucking OK. The insecurity from past months still lingers on, the bullying from my past still lingers on, some days quiet, some days intense. I don't want to hurt my girl , she is the best anyone could ever have. I don't want to hurt my parents, they are the best anyone could ever have, but I am fucking suicidal right now, I have cried so much today that I'm feeling numb to the pain. I feel so much hurt that it makes me tremble.. I feel like a mess explaining myself on the internet.. I guess its my last resort to not hurt the people I love the most. I feel like nobody takes me seriously ever, I feel that no one cares enough and I am tired of trying to be OK, I am just tired. I am heading to the beach once again... Please don't tell me to be thankful for life. I didn't ask for it, I want to be unborn right this instant because no one wants to understand me.. I was told that we will get through this together no matter how long it takes but I don't think that is in effect anymore.. I have been and am a victim of depression but i try to cope with it. People don't realize that for people like me it only takes one word to give that ""nudge"" towards killing oneself.

&amp;#x200B;

 Posted in r/depression before, found out this is the appropriate subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway if you read it till here thank you so much for your time.. I wish I wasn't feeling like this and I wish I wasn't suicidal. I wish I was better for you all."
857,i didnt consent to being born,im an adoptee. if i had parents id call the police on them. im trapped here. help.
858,I realized it doesn’t go away,Started getting my life in order and set up a plan for the future. Tried to do normal things. Thought it would work. But I just realized it won’t go away
859,everytime I get pissed off I want to kill myself,every time someone or something pisses me. off I always think about how it'd be better off killing myself since I can't be pissed off dead. that happens if I get embarrassed too. I fucking wish I was dead anyway
860,"I’ve always been suicidal, but the idea of my family and friends finding out stops me","Ever since 8th grade I’ve had thoughts of suicide, but whenever I consider how I would go about doing so I think about how my family would react and I stop because I don’t want to hurt them. My close family has a history of depression and I feel like if I hurt myself it’s possible they might too. My mother has said before when I was little that if my brother or I died she would kill herself, and that is honestly probably one of the only reasons why I haven’t gotten to planning ever. My life shouldn’t be hard. I’ve had a very fortunate life, which makes me think I’m a failure for being suicidal because most of the suicidal people I see have been through so much. I feel like I need to develop ambitions and try harder in school, but my terrible procrastination and failure to plan makes it hard for me to do much of anything. I used to do very well in school, before I started to procrastinate. But ever since I started doing homework later and later and over the past year I almost stopped completely. I do care about school and my future but still oddly feel unmotivated when the time comes to actually get work done. Now I feel like I’m past the point of recovering. I feel like my story is nothing in comparison to the pain that a lot of the people I see on this subreddit feel, but I thought I’d get this out because I feel like if I told someone i knew it would affect our relationship a lot."
861,Idk,"Last night I got somewhat drunk and decided that I wanted to die. I'm a 16M in high school. I know overdosing is really painful, so I took 4 motrin instead of everything I could find, and slept on my back. This was in hopes that I would vomit and asphyxiate in my sleep. Obviously it didn't work. I left my life up to luck and I (unfortunately) lived. I have been seeing a therapist for a little while now and one of the first things we set up was a suicide safety plan. I signed the plan saying I would not kill myself and would make it to the next session. I don't usually post on social media because it makes me really anxious, but I have to ask. Was this a violation of the ""contract"" even though I didn't actively try to kill myself? Do I have to/should I tell my therapist about this?"
862,thinking about ending my life,"Doing it is easy I’m just so afraid of how much it’ll hurt my mom. I don’t think I could put her thru it.... even though she has finally found the love of her life and I feel as if it’ll be easier for her to get thru then before and what I mean by before is that I’ve been suicidal for many many years I’m 22 and I’ve been suicidal since age 9

The death of juice wrld recently had a huge impact on me because i relate so much to his music and it’s the fact that I’ve been depressed nearly my entire life I’m so alone everyone that used to be my friend hates me and talks bad about me even though I keep to myself

I can’t even type proper or express how I truly feel I’m so fed up with life and just want things to be over

I want to be gone for good
I literally have nobody
I’m a nice caring loving person
I used to go out my way for people
I’d cross oceans for people who wouldn’t bother to get their feet wet for me

Can somebody please help me I’m reaching out on here praying i can be told everything will be okay when nothing will ever be okay

I need courage to do this to myself

it’s time I lay down to sleep for good and to never wake up again hoping that I will be at peace finally............."
864,I think I'm gonna just do it,"Sick of my girlfriend and life too. Got a 12 gauge and nothing else for nobody

Don't you dare follow in my footsteps but I think my time here has come to an end 

I don't want to shoot those cops. They was being cool and tried to help me 

But nothing can help the call of the void

Maybe I should go do some harm

Maybe I should commit some crimes

But I think I better just find out what steel pellets taste like"
865,Last night (my story),"Last night I took 30 Midol pills. Expecting to just die I climbed into bed. Then it hit. At this point I regretted it. I called poison control and told them I didn’t want to die after all. I was seeing yellow. My vision was so dizzy. I felt high. Hour one was alright. Hour two I felt tired. By hour 5 I couldn’t drink anything. Hour 8 is when it got bad. The chills made me strip and lay on the bathroom floor. Then the pain started. 

I tried everything, to pee, too puke. To bring everything up. Nothing worked. I sat there crying out to God that I was sorry. That I didn’t want to die. That I wanted to be there for my boy (my cat 😅). I guess He heard me. I got a wave of dizziness. I fell off the toilet before getting the worst pain of my life. But also the best pain. 

I vomited all over the floor. On my hands and knees like an animal. I felt some relief. I thought it was over. By 11 I was throwing up in my bed. 

I felt pain everywhere. By now I regretted even taking the pills. I’d always been a rational person. But today I felt so low and alone I thought I was sure that this was what I wanted. I had never been more wrong. 

I feel asleep around 2? 3? Desperately trying to get comfortable. 

To the people that talked to me yesterday on this app, thank you. You may not have changed my mind before I took the pills. But your words stayed with me. And I probably wouldn’t have died from these pills. But this is my story. 

Suicide isn’t worth it. I know that now. Thank you to all who were on my side."
866,Matter of time,"I've forgotten how to feel good about myself. I'm an addict. I'm chronically unhappy. I'm in treatment for addiction, and mental health. I'm grossly unhappy in my relationship, but I have nowhere else to go. Some nights, if being around my SO is too much, I sleep in the basement on the building I used to manage. If I'm not riddled with crippling anxiety, I'm fantasizing about killing myself. It feels like I'm getting closer to doing it with each passing day. I'm 34, broke, medicated, unhappy, and out of hope. I don't know how to live a normal life. I don't think I even want to. I just want to sleep, and not wake up. 

It feels like healing isn't worth the process, anymore."
867,Drunken poetry (please ignore),"3 AM
Pounding white claws at my parents’
I don’t dream for the press of your warm lips
I dream for the press of a cold barrel 

I switch to my parents’ gin
Thieving piece of shit wants what isn’t his
Why should some people have while I go without
Feel like I’ve been wronged but my enemy’s invisible 
Because without a mirror you can’t see yourself

Everyone’s happy but me
Everyone gets what they need but me
I am the cursed one, the freak, the outcast
And my fate is to either smite them all or myself

They don’t deserve pain, since to ignore me is no crime
I deserve this padded solitary confinement
I haven’t paid for anything in my life
The drunken fool is his own kryptonite

I deserve hate
But I am a snake
I slither to where I am safe
And let others believe I am an angel

I can’t hide forever
Because nothing is everlasting
Something great and terrible will happen
And nothing will stand in the way between the law of nature and myself

Everything has balance and my life has not obeyed
Your luck has run out
Face the music, smell the coffee
Fraud; heed your own sentence

She was a fluke, you were bound to walk alone
Let go of what was never meant to be
And rather obey natural order
And die when you deserve

Bullets will pierce your body
Whether metal or organic
Your feelings about it are irrelevant 
The world does not care

Some will weep, others will cheer
But you will not know the difference
For in the ground from which you were birthed
Nothingness births no sorrow

“How could you do something as selfish as suicide?!?”

“He was a good kid, I didn’t see this coming at all!”

“Good riddance, one less upper middle class prick taking resources away from those who worked hard and deserved it”

“Thoughts and prayers”

“Thoughts and prayers”

“Thoughts and prayers”

Please excuse my drunken rambling.
I’ll delete this tomorrow."
868,Nowadays if I face problem all I think about is killing myself,"I've been raised by really strict parents. When I was little I was quick at learning so they always pushed me to the top and I was always lucky because I never failed. Once I studied abroad I was free man. 
 Now I came back home after 7 years and they are still trying to control me. I'm already 24. First blamed me for being lazy. After work I come back eat and sleep. I do kinda physical work sometimes  stands a lot or carries lot of heavy stuff or really hazardous. Then blamed me for my temper. It wasn't like I was yelling at her or him. Maybe I'm not remembering what have I done. But I always had short temper since little. And now blaming me for having girlfriend. Telling me you are too young, you are coming home late, you need to work etc. Even my father gave me notes about some juju five element thing that me and my girlfriend is not a good match. And he is a engineer FYI. 
And today I pickpocketed. No ID no money nothing. Nah, still got my phone. Just yelling at me about how much I'm careless. Not doing shit. Coming home late. All I was thinking is death. Just grab knife slit my throat. Our country believes that therapy is for crazy people so it's quite hard to find therapist that could help me. I wish I could feel nothing."
869,Chronic migraines and wanting to die,"I have been suffering with chronic migraines for about half a year, they are almost there every day. I actually don’t know how to cope with it anymore, I took pain medication way too often and now it doesn’t help anymore. I still have to wait months for a specialized doctor. Does somebody have the same problem? It’s really hard because u cant really live that way. I just stay at home all the time because I’m scared that If i go out the migraine will come again. My social life is dead."
870,I wanna fucking cry but I can’t.,I haven’t been able to cry in a long time. I am going through the darkest time in my life but it’s just like the tears won’t come out. I feel like a disappointment to my family and like I am never going to do anything in life. I’m almost 24 and have never had any form of romantic relationship and don’t see that changing anytime soon. I hate the fact that I am gay because it is like no one understands and I feel like everyone is constantly judging me for it. I am lonely and want it all to end. I have friends to talk to but don’t want to bother any of them with my shit so that’s why I am posting here. I told my mom I want to kill myself but her only reaction was to send me to treatment which I am not doing. I don’t have means to efficiently do it either which is beyond frustrating for me. My worst fear is trying to kill myself and ending up in inpatient again or with permanent damage.
871,Being able to envisage suicide is the only thing that brings me true happiness and contentment,"I can talk about it like an exciting holiday. I look forward to it. There literally nothing I'd rather do, in the grand scheme.

But I have a girlfriend, a brother and two parents I'd leave behind. It's unethical distancing myself from them so I can do this. Just doing it would be too hurtful. But pushing away people so close that you love, to the point where you don't know anyone, is *hard*. If euthanasia were legal, this could be done without everyone having to act like a bunch of children, no offense. I'm sorry if I'm not envisioning other people's situations right now, I don't think anyone who has children under 25 should be granted euthanasia except where they're in very bad shape, since it would damage the children. But that's why I'm against people having children, too. Fuck. If you're not healthy enough to raise healthy children then don't fucking do it. FUCK my life. I. do. not. want. to. exist.

I feel torn about my girlfriend. She fucking deserved BETTER. FUCK

I get glimmers where I can imagine getting busy but the world is so depressing and makes me so fucking angry, it's no more than minutes before that state of mind retreats. I used to enjoy things. I used to have ambitions, and goals. I burnt out when I realised how fucked the world is. What might a non-suicidal 'me' look like? I'd probably have to remove myself from social media entirely. No more news. No more politics. No more bureaucracy, all the way down to no people to ruffle my fucking feathers. So, I need to live alone in the fucking wilderness, great. I really might as well just kill myself."
872,Failed Highschool and contemplating suicide,"I just failed 2 classes at highschool and just turned into a bigger dissapointement than i already was
I was never a smart kid or a lucky one, my family doesnt care about me and im dealing with severe depression, insomnia and hallucinations
I just had enough of this world and i cant deal with this anymore, ive been forced to live a constant humiliation and it all bottled up and im just tired of this all
Im sorry for any mistakes in my text, english is not my main language
Please
What should i do.."
873,I also wish I was the person you want me to be,"I hate school, I hate it so much, I break down crying thinking about going there, I get really painful migraines and pains in my face and I stay home a lot, I literally asked my mum last night if I could go to the doctor today because my migraines are lasting so long and are really painful and she said yes but now I’ve woken up and she’s complaining to my sister about how much she can’t stand me.

My family let me know how useless I am, I can hear them now going on about how pathetic I am, how Im lying about being depressed despite being on medication and being diagnosed and i’m using my migraines as an excuse, I literally have been in agony for 3 days.

I just want to disappear, I wish I could be depressed and suicidal and isolate myself without being a burden, I hate myself so much, I don’t fucking want to be like this, I don’t fucking want everything to be this hard, I wish I could be fucking normal and get out of bed and have a productive day, its just really fucking hard when i’m so miserable, trust me I’ve tried to fix it, you’ll never fucking understand how hard it is to cry all night because you don’t want to be here and be fully aware that no one gives a fuck about whether you live or die then wake up to you screaming at me about what a piece of shit I am.


I want to be what you wish I was too.

My house is empty, I just want to do it, I hate being here, I hate myself, I’m 18 and can’t do anything myself, I rely on everyone, Im useless and pathetic, I hate myself more every time I stay home instead of going in but I can’t do it, I want to hide. 

Im going to overdose in an hour, when I’ve calmed down slightly, Im done."
874,I am lost and confused,"Am I depressed?

I am not sure, if I am depressed or not because some of the smyptoms are following me for my whole life.

Like low-esteem, finding it difficult making decisions or having a lot of Anxious feelings.

But for a year or so it is getting worse, I am feeling Hopless and worthless, I have little to none enjoyment in thinks I loved to do and I have no motivation nor energy to do anything.

And the thought of Suicide had a minor present in my head for a longtime but now it feels overwhelming, like a countdown that gets evercloser to the end.

I tried calling the Suicide Hotline to get answers and if i need help and where to find it but I tried it for about an hour and no one picked up.

P S: I am sorry for Grammatical errors, for punctuation errors and Spelling mistakes."
875,I’m getting help?,I told my sister about my suicidal thoughts and how sad I was getting and now I’m a few minutes I’m going to a doctors appointment to see what can happen👍
876,BPD has ruined my life,"I am incapable of having healthy relationships, romantic, platonic or even with family

My suicidal thoughts are constant and consistent, I can't (or won't) see past them

I hate myself, at all times, even when I've done something objectively well, I hate myself for it 

I've done DBT twice, and have been in therapy for 8 ish years now (my entire teens). I feel like there is no hope for me.  This is who I am.  I will never feel better and there's nothing I can do about it"
877,Is it normal?,"I [21M] recently attempted suicide over fall break from University. I was put in a mental hospital where I got to talk to people about their situations. Is it normal to think about suicide every single day? I knew I had depression, but one day my friend mentioned he has depression and so does his friend, but she struggles with suicide ideation and he doesn't. It confused me so much. I just figured everyone with depression had suicide on their mind everyday. Is it not normal? Ive heard it called Chronic Suicide Ideation. Do alot of people think this?"
878,Think I'm never going to share my feelings again,"Everybody just stomps on you if you open up, let's face it. Nobody cares. Everybody has their own problems. Everybody wants to be special and think their opinion is better.

""That's not a problem, you are just sensitive"" . Ok, so how does this life make sense for me if I am too sensitive. I'm emotionally damaged and I'm getting help, but it feels like I'm falling down even harder. Burried alive by societal standards and the fact that I don't seem to matter. I can't act like things never happened. Good if you're never hurt.

You are not anybody else. Everybody has the right to feel upset. If life just gives you lemons for over 10 years, you have every right to feel this way."
879,Should I kill myself because I am failing college on my first year?,"Well, I know its only my fault that its just like that and I really don't know how I am supposed to finish my college really, so maybe I should just choose this option instead."
880,I don't look forward to anything.,"These past few months between finishing up uni and starting to work in January were the last thing I had looked forward to. Now the next 40 years (or depending on how retirement ages will develop more) I am a just a robot working. Last time I worked full time I spend the weekend mostly exhausted or depressed in bed.   

That is it. This was my life. Why do I have to continue this, now that nothing good is coming anymore?  

The only thing my brain seems to want is loving caring parents. That isn't something you can buy, so I can't have it. And every other goal, idk own a sportscar? is just completely empty if there is no one to ever be truly proud of you. You can't become someone's real child. You can't actually become someone another person truly cares about in that way. I know that now. That last hope if I just be better, better grades, more achievements, that someone would love me... that is the last illusion that died. There is nothing I can do."
881,Is it really impossible to sanely want out?,"I understand survival instincts play a huge role. But I don't believe it's impossible for someone minimally sane and healthy to come to the conclusion that they don't want to live.
I just don't think the amount of work it takes to be alive, justifies being alive, every single pleasurable experience is so fleeting. While eternal soul sleep is so tempting, just not existing, free of any needs or suffering or happiness or anything good or bad"
882,I am suicidal.," I was just thinking about how things could go in the next years, and I just realised that's there is no really a chance for things to go better for me.

883,Strange rules,"Kind of confused about the rules. You are not supposed to make posts offering help, but that is clearly what many of the posters need. It's obvious that many of the posts here are a cry for help, and the people need somebody to talk to."
884,No one listens to my pain. Help me...,"Im a human. Humans listen to eachother right?
Well not in my case. I told everyone my pain... No one listened to me. Im feeling lonely. I want to stop existing. They always ignore me and  i really want to suicide. Litteraly i hate life.everyone hates me.
You have two choices:
A) Tell me how to suicide
B)Help me to fight this pain and be happy.
Please!"

I’m just done I wanna give up. I have no future so what’s the point. The only thing I’m worried about is if it doesn’t work. Cause then I’m stuck and prob gonna be in a hospital which is just as bad if not more traumatizing than my life already is."

I gotta fake it with my partner through the festive period for the sake of our 8 year old but after that idk.

889,Will this make any sense?,"I know how much you wanna just give up. But I know for certain you are strong enough to get through. However long these emotions and struggles have been haunting you, you will get through. I don’t know you but I believe you. Hard it may be, take a step back and take a look at yourself. You are trying so fuckin’ hard. No one else knows what you’ve been through, you made it this far. Get angry and hungry. You will not allow the darkness to overcome you. Allow yourself the time to regroup. You matter and you radiate so vibrate higher than all those who have tried to suffocate you with self-doubt and self-hatred. The world is already hard, be on your side. I’m on yours."

*Dreaming a dream of a aching, broken heart. Not a nightmare, but a dream.*

Now,   what's important to note down is that i am heavily depressed, and like   most people with depression who think up and pen suicide letters one   must be careful not to over romanticise the very existence you're   pissing away (whilst simultaneously trying not to proselytise the   slower-minded to a similiar point of view). So i'm doing this to   slightly alleviate the impending sense of doom that couples so heartily   with the constant  loneliness. In a way, to vent.

I   was going to get an ant farm,  create stories for them individually  and  pick them off one by one, but  this is both less time consuming and  a  far amount cheaper. I'm a 24 year  old, straight male, raised   working-middle class &amp; I'm white. What a  premise eh?

I enjoy words. 

So   you will see a word, I will then give my very own use of that word in   a  sentence, and then tell you a story that has happened to me based    solely around said word. Fucking riveting.

Lets go.

Inculcate \[in-kuhl-cate\] – To implant ideas by repetition; to brainwash or condition someone

*“Inculcate.   You know, it’s like Pavlov and his dogs with the bell, or George W.   with a nation and the word terrorist. Not to offend, but before Bush, I   thought jihad was just when playas, and ballers alike, described   something their homie once owned”*

Me   and my ex girlfriend broke up 5 months ago. It may have been 6 but    I've been in quite the stuper since then. I've been fucked up on coke,    drink, acid &amp; ketamine since. In, and outside, of where i work. I    lost my one consistency which sucked absolute balls because I could  only   ever gauge my own sense of self through her; if she was pissed  off,,   then I was doing something wrong and subsequently became  depressed, OR   if i was depressed, she'd then be pissed off.Real Romeo  &amp; Juliet type stuff.\*I wanted to die first to stick it tor  her.\*Anyways, back to the word.Inculcate  is to brainwash someone, or as  Pavlov and Skinner did, in  different  ways, to condition  something/one. I was the thing in our  study.

As I have aforementioned,i loved this girl with all my heart.

Here goes.

I'm   a drunk. I can be a loquacious drunkard who just love hearing from    everybody and chatting about your cats, and i can even be a factotum to    extent, where every round is on me and I'll ""Getcha anything ya need"".    But I can be bad, like all people. I can push buttons, i can show you  a   Cheshire cat grin halfway through an argument where you'll want to    murder me, and I can bring up the time you drunkenly punched me in the    head because i was \*""Winning the argument"".*Yet I was the one who woke up to the same inculcated mantra every morning:*""Do you remember last night?""\*The words that will follow me to sandpit I plan on drowning in,

Firstly,   I never remembered the night before. Which, might I add, I was pretty   confident she knew. See, the thing about drinking a bottle of bottom   shelf scotch in two hours says a number of things, mainly that you   didn't want to think about/remember the rest of your day.

*I paused mid-thought as her smile effortlessly floated into my mind. Beauty and grace epitomized.*

I coined the phrase *""Girl on the train-ed""*.

I   got told I was awful for a year straight of nights out, some of which,    I hardheartedly believe, which made the false ones even more    discouraging for our supposed trust for one another.

This   was all after one night of play Articulate, a pictionary-with-words    type deal board game, I was told i was such a dick to everyone    involved.And after several months of being asked *""Do you remember last night?""* I decided to investigate deeper.

Turn out I was just as drunk as usual. A nob. Inappropriate. But me.

**I pick the rusted relic up off the desk.**

I   spent a year listening to the same inculcated mantra about my own    actvities. What was true? What wasn't? She held the truth but spun it in    a way that it couldn't help me, but could benefit her whenever she   felt  like it.

**Grip the handle tight.**

I should feel more about it now we're apart, but all it does is remind of the time I had a threesome with two lovely ladies.

**Press the barrel to the heart, place the finger on the trigger.**

There is absolutely no comparison.But it happened.

**Calm &amp; still for the first time in years.**

And if I said it enough, I could even inculcate you into thinking so...

**Pressure.**

It did though. It definitely happened.

    Fade to white."
891,I've never been so close to end it all,"I've been having suicidal thoughts for about 5 or 6 years but I have never been so close to doing it until now. More than unconsciously planning I'm also unconsciously accepting it.

I might do it this week. Rent a hotel room for a couple of days – so I don't fuck up the family house like I fuck up everything else –. Buy about 10 bottles of wine. Sit on the bed. And try to drink it all. Until I finally pass out.

I just don't know what else to do. I'm stuck in a dead end job. In a shit hole third world country. I guess I'll never achieve my dreams of traveling the world, owning my own business, buying a house. I don't deserve it anyway."
893,How do you get someone to accept that this is something some of us want?,Please tell me how.. all I hear from people is that I’m talking stupid but I know I’m not the only one who feels this way
894,"I wish that my life mattered more, but it doesn't.","I'm currently 30 years old.  As a little background, I dealt with a short bout with depression during my teen years and eventually overcame those issues of not wanting to live anymore and feeling like life wasn't worth living.  I tried having a positive outlook on life for a number of years after my high school years, and for a while it worked but then a couple of years ago I just felt like a lonely life failure and heavy depression set in.  I haven't been able to get a career path going, haven't found or discovered any talent for a career path so I feel talentless.  Haven't been able make any close friends or long term connections, no one in particular to enjoy hobbies with to keep my mind away from stress of life going wrong.  Not once in my adult life have I had a long term romantic relationship or physical affection of any kind to hold onto, even though many people I meet have told me how wonderful of a person I seem but that doesn't seem to change the fortunes of my love life.

I went to a mental health facility a few months ago after I revealed to my parents that I felt like going through with taking my own life, just ending it.  Admittedly while the process felt like it dragged on a bit, it seemed positive at the time and I did meet some neat people going through similar rough patches in life.  People who just needed someone to talk to like I did, to not feel alone anymore.  I went through some different kinds of group therapy sessions and it was a good experience overall to be honest, the people working at the mental health center along with some of the other people admitted there helped me feel less empty than I had felt in a long time.  There's one person I still talk with occasionally from that place who's a great person, but the the empty void of not having any close connections or a significant other, or someone to enjoy nerdy hobbies with, still remained.

I didn't want to use any, but did begrudgingly get on some anti-depressants after leaving the mental health center.  Have been taking those for a few months now.  I followed through on seeing a therapist/life coach in 1 on 1 sessions around once a week.

I tried shaping things up with myself, looking for work or career paths online, anything in a sort of creative field or video game related field just to feel like I could try doing something with my life instead of feeling lonely and isolated all day with no talent.  I've tried finding some online gaming and Dungeons &amp; Dragons stuff to find people to connect with and become buddies with.

I've tried 4-5 different online dating sites with a paid subscription.  In the past I tried /r/r4r and OKCupid many times with no luck and rarely got a response.  I've continually tried putting myself out there to find a special someone even if on the inside it was hard to put up a positive image and a smile with how empty I felt on the inside, feeling like I'd never be interesting enough or women wouldn't want me for whatever other reason.

I've gone through the steps other people wanted me to do and have done my best.   I've asked for so much help the past few years, and no one is able to help.  Not even my therapist, who's a good guy and someone I can vent to but they don't have any concrete solutions to the things that are ailing me.  My mom just keeps saying ""You just haven't found the right person yet.""  I keep telling her not everyone does and that some people just die alone, and that someone isn't just going to magically drop into my life and be interested in dating me and accept me.

Now instead of feeling heavily depressed with a sinking feeling in my chest everyday, now it just feels more empty and alone with the anti-depressants taking care of some things but not making my life any happier.  I feel like I'm doomed to die alone.

*Nothing has changed, and I hate it.**"
896,I feel like I'm supposed to die. I was never supposed to live.,"When I was 16 I read a quote somewhere, ""Maybe life just isn't for everyone"". And all the vague thoughts I've had my whole life suddenly made sense. I'm almost inclined to divide my life into before and after that moment. It resonated. It's been 5 years and I can't let go of it. From the moment I read it, everything made sense. I've strayed from it multiple times, sometimes far, sometimes for long periods, but I always come back. It's the only thing that makes sense.

I was a mistake, I wasn't supposed to have been conceived. It doesn't make me special, not at all. Doesn't make the people who are like me special either. Some energies are just supposed to stay in the void. But we're stuck now. Forced to go through it? We all go back one day but I want to go now. All I do is hurt people.

Why did I ruin my parents lives? Mistake. Why do I hate existing? Mistake. Why do I hate people thinking of me? It's wrong. Why do I feel disconnected to my own face in the mirror? Because it's not mine."

898,not sure why i’m writing,i come here when i feel hopeless. in the midst of finals right now and the stress is insane. i thought my heart was going to give out today. almost didn’t care anymore because i kind of have been thinking about dying anyway. considering the hospital but i don’t know if i’m there yet. sleeping pills barely work anymore. wish i was gone already. i’m too scared to die. i fucking hate being alive though. not really asking for help i just feel so fucked. not just with school but everything else. my doctors cry when i talk about my past. i don’t know what the fuck i’m doing anymore everything hurts
899,I think I've screwed this all up enough and it's time to leave.,"I quit my job without a plan two weeks ago because it was killing me. 

I've got no money, no real prospects, no training, and no time. 

I just don't want to fail again. 

Nobody calls or texts me anymore, nobody talks to me anymore, I'm gonna be alone on Christmas. Again.

I can't think of a reason not to."
900,Mentally trapped.,"I’m seriously contemplating suicide after the traumatic experience I had due to a relationship. I’m writing this in hopes that someone can talk me out of it but I think it’s beyond possible. I’m being stalked, threatened and verbally abused. I have a plan that is very detailed and specific. I’ve seemed help from family, friends and professionals. Nothing has helped. My friends don’t want to be involved my family has shunned me and professionals keep telling me they can’t imagine what I’m going through. Nothing has helped and I’m not really sure why I’m even writing this because my mind is pretty much made up. I have nightmares about this. I’ve turned to god, turned away from god really nothing helps. I have major PTSD from all that’s happened and still nothing gets better."
901,"I wish I was born into an abusive family, maybe then I would have a reaon to be the way I am","For my whole life I've had everything handed to me, I'm living a perfect life surrounded by perfect people. I also want to kill myself, I've been depressed and suicidal for many years and all I ever do is bring other people down.

 I spend all day staring at walls, ghosting friends at thier most vulnerable moment, and breaking furniture because something didn't quite go my way. I've lost pleasure in everything I do, including hobbies, anything I used to find fun, school, and socializing.

 I managed to not do a single school assignment all year but my parents quickly forgave me like the angels they are. How the fuck did they give birth to a demon like me. Why the fuck am I here I deserve to be punished, I ask for it, I want some sort of excuse, everyone else here has one but I'm just a selfish prick who sits in bed all day pissing people off."
902,Do you people even care,"Like really, it seems real fuckng easy to make a subreddit and sit up there on your thrones lookin down on the likes of me doesn't it. Nobody likes to deal with somebody mad about the hand they've been dealt in life, I feel like you all just wanna give me some bullshit condescending advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what I am doing here, I have some kinda deathwish or something. I feel obligated to say that I'm genuinely not trying to sound edgy, or hip, or whatever. I've already been disowned by my family, how bad can death actually be. Yet here I am, clinging on, for I don't even know what."
903,Enough?,When do you know enough is enough? I always prayed to have enough courage to end my life. Tonight I've been pushed further than I ever have. I don't think I ever will kill myself but it can't be healthy that I pray I don't wake up Everytime I sleep...
904,I made a playlist today,"I made the playlist that I would like at my funeral today and it felt completely normal. There’s a few more things I need to do before I leave, I love each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart. Don’t miss me. It will all be okay♥️"
905,Suicidal thoughts comforting,"I think I’m using suicidal thoughts for comfort. As in, you don’t have to worry about any problems coz once you kill your self nothing matters.. I don’t think I could kill myself though, I just put myself in dangerous situations.. walking in front of cars... Saturday night I deliberately drank a lot and then took a bunch of party drugs that I’ve been warned not to mix with my meds. Then tried to antagonise a rough group of people that I assumed carried.

So it’s not like self inflicted but keep looking for it...  very confusing."
906,"I need advice, kinda badly","It's been a little over a year since we broke up. Around 9 months since we planned to get back together. We broke up because he was working a lot and was super stressed and he had to start working more to help his mom pay the bills and stuff. We would've had hardly any time to talk or hang out. It was so hard on both of us. We talked about stuff one night, confessed we still loved each other, planned to get back together within about 3 months(so he can work and get money and get his own place or live with a friend) but when the time came closer we talked less and less until it was around the time. Nothing. I decided to text him and ask if he'd changed his mind, he said no but there was a change in plans. It wouldn't work. His mom was in the hospital for a little, so they got evicted because they couldn't pay the rent anymore. He moved from 30mins away to 1hour and 30mins away and didn't even tell me. I asked if the space was really enough to make him walk away. I later asked, ""don't you wish there could still be something [between us]?"" And he said yea, but it's not going to, because I won't [have another long distance relationship]"" I don't want to push him to ask why it's such a deal breaker for him because when we started talking about our past struggles and traumas and he told me one of his ex-girlfriends shot herself while on video call with him. Idk what caused this but I really feel like that could be it because he is completely 1000% against LDRs. A little after we broke up, he seemed so unbothered by it that absolutely killed me inside and made me SNAP. I knew he cared and it hurt him a lot too and it was all just his shell that he hides behind. When I snapped, I started desperately showing him how much I truly love him and how this is killing me and it hurts and all this other stuff. I honestly hate myself for the way I acted and things I said. I have apologized multiple times and he says it's okay, but it still kills me to think about it. This is why my main acct on Instagram is still blocked by him. I have a Lil Peep fan page and he saw it in one of the screenshots I sent him around the time I went insane, but idk if he remembers it. I follow him on there, I know it's kinda weird but after nearly a year of not seeing him or knowing anything he's doing, I needed something. It's been a few months since then and I saw one of his friends commented on his post telling him to come see him in [close place 30 mins from me where he lived] before he (the friend) leaves (for military stuff) and he replies, ""I live in (close place he used to live) now, I'll see you"" and he hasn't told me he's moved back. There was no mentions of anything. I haven't brought it up so in case he'd get mad and block that account(probably wouldn't but he'd either have known it was me or joke about it being creepy and laugh it off) and tbh idk it kinda hurts. Why wouldn't he tell me he's back ? We still talk and we're friends and all, and soon he said he wants to come over and have sex still(we've planned it for about a month, we're just busy and I live at home🙃) and yes, I know that sounds really bad. If I was being used for sex I would not stick around. But I know him, I know he's not the type of person to fuck anyone for no reason. I'm the only person he's had sex with, and vise versa. I know he still cares even just a little because we still actually talk even after everything I did and said and we've been talking a bit more here lately and he asked how things are, how I am, explained he's living with his friend (one guy he's posted pictures with on his insta before) but didn't say where. It's so hard to not explain how I feel to him. I'm terrified if I do and get a negative reaction that what happened before would happen again. I love him so much, there isn't words to express how much I love him. And after this year and a little of being apart I've realized I love him a little more than I had the whole year we were together. I've realized more than ever how much he means to me and how much I need him. I still have frequent breakdowns over it and I feel like I've been stabbed in the chest every single time while I cry on my bed or in the floor gasping for air. I think about him all the time every single day. I have dreams about him. I sometimes dream we get back together and I get so happy, all of my pain disappears. I'm at peace. Then I wake up and realize it was a dream, then want to die or just dream forever. It hurts so badly... Every single day. I don't know what to do. I need help"
907,I'm not in the mood for help,"yeah like, am I the only one that just doesn't want help?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sleepy, so i got to sleep soon to get ready for work tommorrow.  Part of me wants to make tomorrow the last day but idk.  It's not a strong feeling."
908,I’m sad and I’m trying to stay alive,"I’m just lonely, I have issues being alone. I feel extremely lonely. My whole depression started a year ago when my ex and I broke up. I have attachment issues. The thing is I like being alone, but I like being around specific people. I’m a walking paradox. Usually I bash myself with thoughts of loneliness, my mind just gravitates to bombarding thoughts that I’m a loner and that I’ll be alone forever. I dont find joy in anything anymore because I’m constantly thinking about finding someone to be there for me even though I know I just have to be completely at peace on my own. I envy people in relationships a lot. I miss having someone in this world and not just feeling like I’m on my own in this universe. That’s why I’m sad"
909,"I know my death is coming so for that, I’ve found strength","Just knowing that I eventually will go, makes me feel calm and grateful. I’m not going to say that I wish I was never born, because that isn’t true. I’m happy to have experienced my own life and ultimately come to terms with this mental decision that I’ll let go very soon. I don’t look at it as “sad” , I find it more terrifying than sad. I’m content with the short life that I’ve had, now I know it’s time to check out soon. I really do wish that I could just go somewhere say “I’m ready to go, I said my goodbyes etc” but unfortunately I have to take drastic action. which is of course the terrifying part. You see, the whole concept of death doesn’t scare me, it’s just the possibility of failing and disfiguring myself. In an ideal world, would I want to die? Probably not. This world isn’t ideal though, it’s far from it. it’s a place that demands a lot of adaptation and more times than not, your soul. Even as I write this, it gives me such a soothing feeling whereas  a few minutes ago, I was stressing out. I’m ready to go, I know I am. If I had one wish right now, it would be that my family forgot me. that truly is the only ugly part. I don’t want to hurt them but i can’t continue, not anymore"
910,The suicide hotline woman yelled at me!!,I called and needed to vent. After I had said I wanted to drive my car into a river / a few minutes of venting she said “why are you calling here? This is a place you call if you want to live!”I said I just want someone to care and she said I was accusing her of not caring. Unfucking real
911,The thoughts won't go away,"I posted last week that I had managed to find a way to defuse my urge to self-harm. But over the last few days the thoughts of death and suicide have become more persistent.

I actually had a reasonable weekend. Today is quiet at work, no stress to speak of. And yet, here we are. It almost seems like once an hour the thought comes unbidden - sometimes it's just that voice ""I should just kill myself"" or ""I wish I could die"", other times it's the visual image, triggered by seeing something I could use to end it. The feeling is usually gone in a flash, but I use my somatic memory anyway. It makes me feel better, but it doesn't make the thoughts stop coming.

I feel like such a failure. Up until 6 months ago I was doing so well. The depression seemed long gone. But now I feel trapped again. Empty. 


Yesterday in the middle of a kids sporting event I could feel it growing in my chest, like a bubble of fetid gas. And then the tingling in my face, and that sense of unreality. I managed to reground myself, but it almost felt like in the middle of all those people I was going to just walk out without a word and do something. 



I did walk out, but to find a quiet place in the sun where I could concentrate on feeling that somatic memory again. It really does work wonders.



But here I am at work today, and the thoughts won't go away. I can't walk out of a meeting to sit in the sun. I can't let my mind wrap itself up in my healing thought and ignore the world. I needed to leave the office 3 times already, to sit in the park beside the building. I've rescheduled a meeting this afternoon so I wouldn't have to deal.



I wish there was a way to make the thoughts go away."
912,Gloomy Sunday,Just now I heard this song. What are your thoughts about it?
913,Is It Really Worth Living?,"Can I really do this anymore?

The Constant pain and effort of having to live, while giving some serious red flags as signals that should reach my friends, but don't, because either they don't care, or they're just busy with their own problems, and can't deal with my bitchy, whiny ass.

I used to get beat with chopsticks by my mom and grandma. Between the ages of 6 and 10, that's what happened. After school, I would come home, and always hear some kind of commotion between my mom and dad, even when they didn't even live together. When my mom moved out, she was too scared of my dad. She took my grandma and moved into a one-bedroom apartment. She was so scared in fact, that she used me as a messenger instead of using her iPhone. And I was still getting beaten, by my grandma and mom. I was so useless and emotional, and would constantly be a pain in the ass to my friends because of my weakness. I'm still so useless that I'm scared to use an oven so my dad can handle other things he has to do for me and my little brother. I'm a Fucking screw-up. Nothing. I'm so Worthless. My mom Kidnapped me and tried to move me to another county when I was 11. Why do I still love her? Why do I still love my grandma, who constantly manipulates my brother to love her? Is this really all I am, A tool against my hard-working caring father?

My friends are too fed up with my problems to deal with me now. I'm glad they don't worry about it anymore. I was cutting myself 2 weeks ago. The only reason I stopped was that a friend of mine made a pinky promise with me. It was childish, wasn't it? I'm constantly being one-upped in everything because I have no talents. I made a subreddit about my comics just to make myself feel better, and even that is a failure. It's going to get nowhere. The only thing I want to do is become a Mangaka and even then I'm just not good enough. I'm American, which already identifies me as a weeaboo, which then will eventually lead me to be disrespectful to Japanese culture. I'm constantly working as hard as I can to get better at drawing and writing, and I'm still nowhere near any of my friends, and they think they're bad. I'm still so broken, and I can't get rid of it. The people around me just don't care anymore, and my mental state is deteriorating. I have a therapist because of my depression, and we've only scratched the surface. It would be so easy for everyone around me if I was gone. My dad would have to spend less and could get a house faster for my little brother too. My friends wouldn't have to deal with me constantly on their ass. But would I be at peace? Who cares anymore. Morals, goals, dreams. It's all fake. Everything I like is turned into porn or hentai. I'm the weird kid. The one who screams in public. Everyone probably thinks I'm retarded. I've been rejected by girls 5 times. I just can't do this anymore. Sometimes I just need a hug, but everyone thinks it's too gay. My art sucks, and it's the only thing I'm good at. My comic and subreddit for it are failures too. I'm useless, and my goals are shit. 

It would be so easy to kill myself so why not?"
914,I really don’t want to do it but at the same time I don’t really have anything to live for. Life is more painful with each day.,
915,Organ donation,If I had my will and any other necessary paper s with me and I shit myself in front of a hospital would they be able to harvest my organs? Ateast I could be used to someone in that way before I die
916,I might not come back from leave.,"I’m in the military, after trying my damndest for years to make it happen. My parents are still immensely proud of me. This part is important. I always wanted to enlist, and it was my only real long-time goal. Now that I’ve done it and basked in the glory, I’m done.

I’ve been gone for seven months. I haven’t seen either, except for a few hours after graduation five months ago. I’m severely looking forward to going home to see them before I go.

I arrived at my final duty station three months ago, and my mental health has only declined. Less and less of the things I used to care about mean anything to me. I’ve been reflecting on my life a lot all the while, and killing myself just feels like the right thing to do. For me it’s not an emotional issue, full of fury and fat tears, it’s just a logical decision.

I’ve never ‘loved’ life. It’s always felt like something I was just going along with. Anything actually good that happens, or could happen, doesn’t make life worth living. Things only happen that make it LESS worth it.

I feel as though my brain just isn’t meant to be in this world. It just doesn’t work. While I do function, it’s as mismatched as someone who was born mentally disabled. I don’t consider life a gift. It means nothing to me.

I didn’t ask to be here. On this planet. Cliche, but true. I have nothing to prove. I’m grateful for my parents doing all the things they did for me, but (if I go) they were pointless.

Once I’ve spent time with my mom and dad and everybody, I think I’ll just take my rifle, go out in the middle of the night and not come back"
917,I have been fighting all my life - realized I am just simply not for this world and I got fucked at the very beginning,"I got the the point where I don't know where to get help, how to get help and how to untangle my life. Despite my small achievements and luck. I just stumped into shit and I am drowning.   


I have been born in Poland to a very religious family. I love them,they love me but we were always poor, I wore the same fucking clothes for a decade, couldn't afford going out with friends most of the time, had really bad hygiene regime, not to mention shitty diet. All was due to bad decisions of my parents, they got tangled in some huge debts and other problems. And it get uglier and uglier with time and my parents ability to do day-to-day chores.   


I was shy, awkward kid in school. I am probably an aspie but I never have been diagnosed, actually I never been to psychiatrist/psychologist in my entire life. I was just weird. My social interactions were bad, first problems with getting a girlfriend emerged which quickly made me depressed. Not only I had low social skills but I was skinny, I had some health problems and on the top of that I didn't even get a shower every day.   


My high school years were bit better, I tried my best to improve myself but I was still bad in many aspects. Still the same problems with romantic relations etc. I had a dream to become an archaeologist. I just wanted to be someone interesting, have some job which allows you to travel, give something to humanity. I wanted to travel, see other countries, cities, cultures, meet other people. I never got on vacations somewhere else than some religious forest camp in nearby region. I felt I need to get out of my home as soon as possible and just stand on my own feet.   


I had too big dreams. I wanted to study in the UK, I wanted to get what others had at the beginning. Possibility of travel, of meeting other people, of doing something interesting. After school I got my first shitty job where I saved 1 British pounds and bought one-way ticket to UK. It was tough, fucking tough. I had a problem with finding a job, then money problems but eventually I managed to find another shitty job. Unfortunately my depression which has started during my school times only got bigger. I failed to get to the university. I was left with shitty job, no girlfriend, I didn't know many things. Thanks to couchsurfing I managed to make some friends, local and aboard. It got me so excited about possibility of travelling. I wanted to do it myself. And I did. I left my job and went on a hitch-hiking trip across Europe. (with some small stops here and there to get more money). It was amazing, one of the best experiences of my life. I finally realized my dream. I met friendly people, I seen amazing things, I have seen different ways of life people do.   


I was excited to the point of doing something even more crazy. Volunteer! It was a long process but I managed to get a full time volunteering job on a small Greek island. I stayed there for two years and it was awesome. I became volunteering manager, met another bunch of great people... I got involved in some big historical/art related investigation (which I actually started) in Poland which turned out to be fruitful and suddenly I got a lot of... how to say it... prestige? Not in sense of popularity because not many people actually heard of it but  this project has been featured in few major places around the world like Time and Washinghton Post. I was proud as hell. Even more, it has been turned into a documentary movie in which I took a part! Sounds great?    


And then shit fell. My sister-in-law has died. Suddenly, in age of 46. Probably some tumor (there was no autopsy). It broke my brother (older). It broke me as well, I needed to go back to Poland and attend funeral, cheer my brother etc. At that time in my home my parents were living together with over 90 years old grandmother with severe dementia. It was hell to stayed there for more than few weeks. My grandmother was shouting at night, at the morning my mother was listening aloud a radio with a religious station turned on. I couldn't get proper sleep. I just moved to other polish city where I rented a room and found some work. That time was pretty ok, I managed to create a local travelling meeting group. I offered my room to lost travelers. Problem was that my boss was a real dick. Not to me but to other people. I didn't like his ethics at all. I think he was really bad, ugly person who didn't deserve to have so much money. At that time I was very into ethics, philosophy and stoicism. I came to a conclusion it moral and right to leave the job to not give my skills, time and effort to whatever he is doing. So I left.   


I been here and there since then (mostly doing this documentary project I aforementioned) and worst thing happened again. I came back to my home, I was waiting for my salary for the film to come. It took months, instead of weeks. In meantime I have found my first remote job on Upwork. Problem was that I really had no place to work. My parents have hearing problems so all TV, radios are set to high volume. My grandmother was shouting at nights. And it is a small town, so no co-working places nor cafes to spend hours in. Madness. Finally I got my salary and moved to other city in Poland where I rented a flat. Oh, I had a lot of troubles with renting a flat because I stayed in a hostel for few days and got involved in... a rape problem. I mean not as a perpetrator nor victim nor witness. Just one guy from my room has been a witness of rape in a hostel and didn't want to report it. So I was trying to convince him. It really hit me mentally.   


I got my flat. Studio flat to be precise. Finally got some silence but... I lost literally all my saving on getting this flat and paying all deposits and other shit. And it was empty of pots, plates etc. I was in depression, with no money for food, needed to work some hours online. I failed. My routine was bad, or rather non-existent. I shoved my work until deadline, earning small money. (despite being able to actually get a lot of money, because my job is pretty flexible). I borrowed some money from my sister, then I needed to pay for first rent. I managed barely to get enough money by myself. Every another month was the same. I eat little, I earn little due to feeling bad, had no external support. And I made worst choice of my life:  


I borrowed money from a lending company. Not a bank (due to my work I wasn't eligible), but those praying on failure motherfuckers. 30-days pay back rent. I got into a financial spiral very quickly. Because each month I needed to cover a rent + a borrowed money. After 3 months of that I said I need to step back and leave. But I didn't do it and... next month failed to pay on time to my landlord which became angry. (I did not answer his phone for few days due to anxiety and fear). He actually unlawfully asked me to leave within a week. (he had no right to do it but I feel at that time as shit anyway so I agreed to his terms). Came back to my home where I am now.  


It is a nightmare. My grandmother died this year, I got into her room. I am unable to pay debt (I sent some money but it doesn't matter as long you don't pay it all), my parents asked me to pay for their rent as they don't have enough pension money. I support them with money for food. There isn't much food in a fridge, actually all home is in a terrible state. Filth. My mother is living on a wheelchair, hasn't left her home for years. They are all obsessed with religion and praying. (they had shitty lives, all what left is praying). I didn't tell them about my debt. (around $3k) Within days I will get state bailiff for it. My parents will be disappointed and sad.   


Ah, I forgot to mention my other brother. The one who lost his wife. Well, he became homeless and alcoholic. As well in debt. He comes to home to eat and sleep from time to time. My parents are angry on him. They think I am better... well... they will be surprised when a state bailiff will enter our home...   


I think about killing myself. I just feel filth, I stay in my bed most of the time. I would need to visit psychiatrist to get some meds for depression but I don't have a money to go to a psychiatrist. So until I get out of dept I am unable to help my family, to get treatment myself, do something with my social life. (ah yes, I didn't get a girlfriend. Ever. In my life. I am 27). But even if I get meds I have debt and shitty home. It is all tangled and I don't have strenght enough anymore to just do something with it. I am just bouncing back to the same shit every time. I failed, I made wrong choices, I suffer, I deserve this shit and I deserve non-existence.   


One lesson for you people: never NEVER fucking take any loan if you are feeling depressed. It will fuck you, you play with fire. And get meds asap if you can afford it."
918,I feel like it's getting to hard,"I'm a male, age 21. I've been depressed for many years. But now it's been different. I feel like I have nothing. No real friends. A shit job that I hate (amazon warehouse employee). I'm pretty sure my family barely tolerates me, by that I mean that they feel so distant. Every choice I make is answered with ""why?"" There is no real encouragement, they always take my sisters side. I have a girlfriend who I cant stand. She cares for me, but there is so much about her that I cant stand. I try to break up with her and she just wont let me. And now here I am at work hiding typing this out because I feel like drinking bleach. I just hate everything about my life and wish I was dead"
919,Anyone else feel like Sisyphus,I’m just about ready to stop rolling the boulder
920,This will most likely be my last Christmas.,"I suffer from high functioning depression, as well as sociopathic tendencies. As of today’s date 12-15-2019, I have unknowingly allowed my mind to follow what it thinks is natural and best for my own self preservation for the last time. I have been married two and one half months now. I thought everything was going well until my wife told me her parents were getting a divorce. The week after she and I wed her parents had filed. Due to that stress as well as the stresses of normal day life she finally exploded on me. She pointed out everything I already hate myself for and is now beginning to say, “ This is exactly how we’re gonna end up just like my f***ing parents. “ I’m currently sleeping on my couch, I have no blanket by choice, and I am beginning to hear a voice in the back of my thoughts. All I can cohesively think of is Memento Mori. I do believe my deserved time has come."
921,I will do it.,"I know I'll do it. Not today, not tomorrow; but I'm sure that this failure of a human being will die by his own hands."
922,I'm lost.,"I just found out that my childhood bestfriend and now ex boyfriend was cheating on me during our whole relationship, and he didn't even wait a week after our breakup to date someone new. It's so hard for me to comprehend how someone could manipulate someone they've known their whole life for months until they got what they wanted. and then just up and abandon them. I never expected this from him, I thought I knew him, I was and am painfully still in love with him. But it wasn't even him. My whole world is crashing down. I can't think, Its so hard to breathe. We were texting the whole time, and he was acting like he wanted to fix things and we were going to meetup and talk. and there was mention of doing stuff together afterwards. If I had known he had a girlfriend I would have never even texted him as a friend. I feel so sick that I let myself be used for months on end, and that I ignored all the red flags. Looking back our whole relationship was hell and I never deserved any of the things he had put me through. But at the same time I can't help but to wonder if it's my fault and that I went wrong somewhere. I'm so lost. I dont even know who I am anymore. I feel so beat down and broken. This is such a different type of hurt, I can't even explain it. I just feel so irreversibly damaged from this."
923,I have a final exam tomorrow. I’ve been studying all week doing practice problems with friends. I’m on academic probation and let’s just say school was the only reason why I felt like fighting to live. But if I flunk out and am kicked out what good am I? To anyone?,"Everyone was proud of me and looking up to me, but now I just feel empty, cold even. Like if I bomb this final I’m just going to end it. 

Every now and then I have thoughts about driving off a cliff. Just drinking on the edge and going full throttle. I try to distract myself and sometimes talk to loved ones, but I don’t want people to worry about me. I’ve always felt alone despite having many ppl Ik fuck with me heavy.

Even so, I just feel numb and life kinda seems meh rn. I have no idea what I’m going to do."
924,I started believing my own lies for a while but now I guess it's time to go back this this fucked up reality I live in,"I actually managed to tell myself I was a half decent person for a while. I would leave a mess where ever I went, and think I was doing a good thing. Because I just found out that the only redeemable thing I've ever done in my life was actually a bad thing and that I was causing more harm then I was helping. So I guess I have to spend another 7 years building up the courage for another failed attempt, meanwhile sitting in my room having people continuously remind about how shit of a person I am while I just agree with them and just add to load of dumb shit I've done. I use things like being depressed and suicidal as a reason for all these things I do but there's so many people out there who have it even worse and are successful, the truth is I'm just lazy and want attention, I'll never do anything in my life but piss others off."
925,Broken and lost: A short reflection of my current state,"Copy+pasted from a comment I made earlier on a post:

Well I just woke up from another nap and my mind feels a bit more clear so I’ll comment. Haven’t left the house in two days (last week it was 4 days). I’ve been exhausted because of depression, which I had since I was in middle school. I always told myself I wasn’t going to see past 18. I’m now 21 and in my last year of undergrad but I don’t feel like it’s worth it to see the new year. I don’t see a future for myself, I feel broken, insecure, lonely etc. I feel like I can’t have and keep genuine relationships and am just used as a fuck toy/taken advantage of, even getting sexually assaulted by one past friend, emotionally abused by another. I really tried hard to take steps to feel better. I went to my university’s health center but I stopped taking antidepressants after I kept on getting belittled by the person who prescribed me them. I’m scared to enter the university gym because of the fear of encountering the person who emotionally abused me for a year. The only thing that’s getting me by and helping me feel in control is painting and growing my nails (I used to bite them due to anxiety). 

It’s difficult to breathe, difficult to feel motivated.

I just want to feel happy more constantly. This heavy feeling on my mind and heart can’t take the stress for longer."
926,I wish I could just die,I was feeling alright all-day but now I want to cut the shit out of my thighs and shoot myself with my dad's gun or beat myself until I can't move. I wanna stab myself. Anything. I don't know why I feel this way but I fucking hate it..
927,I need help but I dont want to disappoint my family,"I want to try calling a suicide prevention line because I really feel like I might hurt myself, but I know my family would see me different. I'm not sure how it really works but I know that if my parents every found out they would treat me different. I want to break from school because I know I would get overwhelmed and hurt myself if I went, but I know that everyone would hate me if I didnt. Everyone already hates me, and nobody would miss me if I was gone. I just want time to be alone but I live with so many people, it will never get better. What do I do."
928,I’m ready to go,"I have struggled with depression since a very young age. I was thrown in therapy and saw a regular psychiatrist since I was 7 years old. (I am now 22).  Part of me believes there has to be some sort of sexual trauma I experienced at a very young age but the memory is very repressed. I don’t know why else a 7 year old would be in therapy or seeing a psychiatrist when my family was “perfect”

Well it’s been a long life. I had a painful battle with brain cancer towards the end of high school. It ruined my life. I am still living with cancer although I am stable but I have no friends, I’m fat as fuck due to treatments, and people are scared to get close to somebody who could die. Because of my cancer diagnosis, my parents decided to get divorced. I have always struggled with severe depression and anxiety since a very young age. Once I started college, the depression became unbearable. I mean truly fucking physically painful. Y’all, I’ve been pushing through so hard for so long. I am the only person my grandparents have bc everybody moved away and doesn’t care about them and I truly believe my grandparents are the reason I haven’t killed myself yet bc they need me. But I’m hurting so bad. I’ve been hurting for so long. My thoughts are CONSUMED with death. It’s the first thing I think of when I wake up and it’s what I fall asleep thinking of. No medication, doctor, or therapist has been able to help me. I’m alone. I live alone. I cry alone. I eat alone. I go to church alone. I’m broken. When I imagine this pain disappearing(thru suicide) I get an extremely euphoric feeling. A feeling better than any drug has made me feel. 
I’m ready to go. I love my family I really do. My parents have given so much to me and I feel guilty that I am angry at them even though I want them to be happy. Cancer will likely kill me anyway in several years and due to the type of cancer, it will be a very slow and painful death. Im ready to go and I’m sorry to my family. I love them so much I wish I could hug them but I can’t. I love them so much so so so much. I’m just hurting so badly and I know they don’t want me to be in pain."
929,I can't imagine being truly happy,"That's the goal in life right? The thing that keeps people going? My mind is constantly filled with uncertainty, apathy, depression, guilt, regrets over things I've done and not done, loneliness, and so on and so forth. I feel obligated to be strong for others so I look and act fine on the outside but in reality my thoughts torture me all day every day. Iv'e felt this way for so long that I can't picture a point in my life where I won't unless it's by permanent relief. If I'm never going to reach that happiness that everyone strives for then what's the point of continuing?"
930,Planning my death tomorrow,"Hello to anyone reading this...

I have all planned my suicide for tommorow.. it's the only  way I have for dealing with everything that i have done...
I feel like a monster, like the worst person ever and I don't know how I could live with that..

I have struggled with addictions since I'm approximately 15. It started with weed in high school and then I got into speed by the time I was 17 and it was the best thing ever. I lost weight, felt great, like a new me was born. Now I wish that ''me'' was never born. I'm now 26 and addicted to all sorts of stuff. Anything that can make me feel numb  or high. On top of that I happen to be a nurse and now I screwed everything up just to get a little bit of a high.

I stole drugs from my patients for a long time now and it's pretty certain that they are going to notice it tommorow at my job. That means that I'm going to get fired, lose my licence and get arrested and tried in court. I don't think I can handle all that. I just feel so much shame and guilt for the people that I've hurt and that I was supposed to be taking care of... I don't know how I can love my patients so much and still do this to them. That's why I say I'm a monster.

I've stolen some insulin that I'm going to inject in my body tommorow in high doses so I can just end it all.
Seems like the easiest thing to do. I always avoided every problem or trouble all my life so I don't think that's gonna change over night... I can't see myself happy.. I've been depressed all my life and never got over it even though I have everything to be happy and grateful for. I'm gonna write a letter to my parents, brother and my lover. I know it's going to be hard for them but at least I will be in peace wherever this takes me. I don't know why I'm writing all this here but I think it's because I've never said any of that to anyone even though I have been in support groups and everything... Never felt like it was appropriate to say and I always worried about what people think of me! 

Anyway that's enough. I'm gonna play some video games all night and do that tommorow around lunch time. Thank you for listening whoever you are."
931,Think im gonna make it happen this week.,"Nothing matters im so destroyed. Sorry im akward, sorry I dont act the right way, sorry. I cant act the right way and I never have. Fuck I cant even type right. Im alone all the time. Fuck this life. Im never happy. I always have no friends. My intrests are extremely niche. Sorry im bi. Fuck everything. I want my blood and organs to spill everywhere. I hate life. So much pain. The pain will not stop."
932,Relapsing on H to delay/avoid another suicide attempt - how bad of an idea is this?,"I was an IV heroin, crack &amp; meth user for about 4yrs (age 16-20), and then I got clean and stayed clean for 2yrs, until now. I didn't enter treatment willingly but my mother petitioned the court to be in control of me, and they granted it because I had endocarditis from drug use &amp; was in a wheelchair due to anorexia (pro tip: having to re-learn how to walk is incredibly humiliating &amp; not fun). I definitely understand their ruling etc., but honestly the drugs and the ED were the only things keeping me from offing myself. When I  had a bmi under 12 &amp; was shooting up fentanyl &amp; heroin every 4-6hrs I felt like I was already slowly (or not so slowly) killing myself, and as a result my suicidal ideation was much more manageable. 

I am absolutely certain that if something doesn't change soon I'm going to attempt again, and this time make sure I don't fuck it up. I really do not want to do this to my little sister or my mother though, I've already put them through more than they should ever have had to deal with. So, my genius idea is to relapse on heroin in the hope that it will satisfy my suicidal ideation without me actually dying, at least  for a while. I know that me relapsing will hurt my family if they find out, but it honestly seems like the lesser of two evils at the moment.  

I feel like I'm probably missing or forgetting something really obvious that makes this a bad idea, so if you haven't killed half yr brain cells like I did pls enlighten me."
933,"High and depressed, trying to forget...","My family and friends know I'm depressed. They also know I'm managing it. What they don't know is just how bad it is.

I tried to kill myself last night but I couldn't go through with it. I had a bag around my arm and a razor to my wrist. I had my phone next to me ready to call 911 so they could clean up the mess before any family saw me. I didn't want them to have to find me. I was ready to go, and then I remembered I hadn't written a note for my wife so I stopped.

I was going to write that note today and attempt again but I forced myself to go buy my wife a present instead. I still want to write that note though but I don't know when I will.

I don't know who to tell about this so here you go internet. I have a therapist but I don't want to disappoint him after all the progress I've made."
934,Im done,"Long story short. I was abused most of my childhood. I have been in several toxic relationships. I moved for college and thought it was better but now I’m off the edge again. I fucked up one of the only friendships I have right now so I’m completely alone and I’m really about to swallow a bottle of pills cuz I see nothing else to do. 

I have absolutely no one and do not want to end up locked in a treatment center if I cry for help from the authorities. 

I haven’t felt this hopeless in my entire life let alone during any of my previous attempts. I don’t even know why I’m posting this just to say I am extremely close to making a “bad” decision"
935,"Is 3,800 mg of seroquel a lethal dose?","I just want to sleep.

Also not end up back in treatment."
936,Over 3 years ago,"I’m a disabled veteran. I have ptsd and depression and other stuff to go along with my physical injuries. I’m at 90%. I got into a car accident and I got worse. I had an episode at work and ended up losing my job in 2015. After months of depression and failing health lead to me becoming homeless. Then sold everything I owned and packed bags to go move closer to my son and rebuild. I end up getting there and I Had to stay with her and parents since I was-broke, knew nobody there. My ex wife tries to get me to get back together, but I refuse so I get kicked out and threatened with police if I didn’t leave. Her parents are asking me you stay. I left and I only had a bag with all I had in this world. I had a girlfriend that was working in New York. So I got on a bus and after a couple days I was there. I had already decided to finally end it then. 

I spend a week with her. Just enjoying our time together. It was really nice. I didn’t tell her what I was planning. At the end of the week I was going to go on the train to the city to catch a bus back to my moms place. I wrote her a note and left her my laptop bc I told her it was too much to carry. I had stashed a note with my account and  passwords and the majority of the cash that I had left. I said goodbye and on the train into the city I was thinking of ways to end it but ended up talking to a veteran line. I ended up checking myself into the  Manhattan va psych ward. 

Good old 17 north. It was the scariest thing that I had done to admit myself. When you get into that safe room and are behind those doors, the shit gets real again. I don’t think I would have gone into a civilian place. I was numb tired and exhausted and barely said anything to anyone. Met some amazing people in my time there. Met my honest to God soul mate in the psych ward of all places. But that doesn’t mean things end well. I went through programs and recovery and I’m still here. It feels like a lifetime ago but at the same time like yesterday. I was 39 then and didn’t think I’d see 40.

But 3 years later. I’m here. I’ve tried and I’m just tired.  My health is failing and worse than ever. Everyday things are a struggle for me. I barely am able to take care off myself.  I’m not homeless. I’ve got a small apartment. I have a girl or 2 that love me. I have a dying mother. I have a sister with a lovely family. 

I still feel empty inside. I can’t cope with my failing health and the chronic pain has worn me down. I don’t have the strength to fight anymore. I can’t handle being unable to take care off myself. I’m in debt being repair. My trauma and pain don’t get better. Everyday is suffering. 

I feel like I’ve given it a chance and things have only gotten worse. I’ve made a plan. It has given me a calm reserve. It’s give me a goal. I’ve done my research. I am not compromising my rules. I always had rules and conditions on my suicide. I didn’t want my loved ones to find me. Don’t want anyone else to get hurt. Etc. 

I break down in guilt bc the few people that do care about me will be hurt. That’s what had kept me going. I just can’t keep going anymore. Just one more day."
937,lonely and worthless,i want to kill myself because two people on fb in a row (like literally the very first two posts in my newsfeed) are getting married and my friend who i commiserate with about being single and lonely is getting back with his skinny cute quirky ex and most of my other friends are in relationships and then there’s me who hasn’t had a stable love life ever. i never will either. so what’s the point of even trying to find someone at this point since it’s never going to happen. i’ve tried countless times to find people on apps but nothing’s ever come to fruition (or even past a first date). plus i live in a city where i have no friends so i can’t meet someone irl. basically i’m done with all of this stupid fucking bullshit and will be self harming and/or attempting suicide either tonight or in the coming weeks leading up to new years. i cannot do this anymore. i need a relationship to be happy and that’s obviously not going to happen so i’m just preparing to end my life.
938,I dropped out to focus on my business which was going great but now is failing and I have no career option because I have no college or university grades or degrees and cannot keep running my business,"What do I do? I have saved around $20,000 from my business, I want to just travel as much of the world I can with that and then kill myself

I own a software business which has around 4000 users and they paid for lifetime access to my software which is a dumb decision by me because I technically have to support them and the software forever and now my mental health is so fucked because every day I’m working on updates and I just can’t handle it anymore. I dropped out of school and I have $20k to show for it but now I have no career path or anything... all I can think of every day is killing myself because I can’t keep updating my software every day it’s killing my mental health inside and it’s barely working, I get so many support tickets every day

All I think of every day is buying a ticket to some other country and then killing myself so my family can’t find out what happened, or travelling to some other country and trying to stay there for as long as I can before I’m caught, maybe goto the amazon rainforest where I’ll inevitably die but at least I can say I did something interesting in my whole life

I have no future"
939,Goodbye?,"If my parents or friends find this, I just want to say sorry that I took your time and effort and wasted it (possibly)

So the scenario is that I cut my wrists a lot, they’re bleeding so much to the point where it could be viable that I will die or at least pass out from blood loss.

Obviously there’s a reason why I did it but I don’t want to go over it, it doesn’t matter anymore.

I can feel my head, it’s growing so heavy and there’s a tension in my forehead, my eyes hurt.
My wrists are so wet and I’m so sorry to my dad if I don’t wake up, thank you for talking to me today. If I don’t make it to tomorrow, I’m so so sorry. Please don’t think you failed as a father, you were the best father I could ever ask for and the same goes to my mother.

I’m sorry"
940,How do I tell someone about being suicidal?,"I don't know how to tell someone about being suicidal without making them freak out or judge me.

 I feel like I'm at the end of my rope and I need some support I just don't know what to do. I always think about telling the doctor or psych about it but I can't for some reason. Let alone my family or friends. I feel like I shouldn't even tell them because it would just be a burden, but at the same time I think killing myself would be more of a burden.

I know my mum would be supportive, she has tried to kill herself multiple times and is always encouraging me to seek mental health support. She did an inpatient program and it helped her, but even still I cant bring it up. I just don't want to upset anyone.

I just feel lost and I am looking for some guidance."

I’ve thought about making myself throw up after I eat but I have not been eating much at all lately. I work out a lot but to not avail. 
I’m never happy anymore. I recently got sober and clean and I really miss my old life of drinking and popping pills. Now I have to feel pain without getting drunk or high and I hate it. I have no friends. I isolate all the time in my apartment. I hate even going out to check the mail. I’m financially screwed. I don’t feel attractive around men anymore and that’s what used to feed my confidence. 
I just don’t see anything getting better, I really don’t."
942,Jester,"I'm just a fucking jester. everyone treats me like I'm here to provide for them, whether it be money, or advice, an opinion, or entertainment. and then, when i have something to say or start developing emotions, or just when I don't have any use for them anymore, then they throw me away until later. or they just abandon me. my dad left, my friends left, members of my family left. everyone leaves me at some point or another. I'm tired of being treated like everyone's court jester and personal punching bag. maybe when they find me with crosses sliced into my arms they'll finally take me seriously, but it'll be too late then."

I'd pull out the gun and everyone would be screaming thinking I'm going to shoot them. I say a small limerick about how sad I am and turn the gun on my self. My brains would be splattered everywhere. I'd be stained on the wall and carpets and on every nook and cranny. They'll never forget me and how much I was hurting. 

Sadly though, I'm probably going to die of liver failure or lung cancer from my atrocious addictions."

well, of course, this isn’t the right subreddit to post this on, because you aren’t supposed to promote suicide. but i’m just tired of waiting. i’ve already chosen the method, it’s just a waiting game at this point. 

whether or not someone wants to end it alongside me doesn’t really matter. i guess it would just make ending it a lot easier.

947,"So Angry, Yet Thankful","About 44 hours ago, after months of suicidal thoughts, I finally attempted to do so after being triggered (over a final I thought I did bad on) by swallowing an abundance of pills and drinking a dose of nyquil. Almost immediately I had regretted my decision and called a close friend of mine who alerted my roommates.  

      When I realized school was about to get involved , I completely panicked and went animalistic. I tried to fight off my roommate who was holding me down. I knew my life was basically over and there was nothing I could do anymore. For months, I feared that this would happen and it did.

      They got school/residential life involved and EMTs came to escort me out of the dorm hall and I was taken to the nearest hospital.

      For hours, I was treated like a villain and was called things such as being evasive, a liar, and a threat to everyone. The whole process was so dehumanizing and they almost involuntarily admitted me. One of the doctors wouldn’t even let speak to explain myself and kept going on about how they were 100% going to admit me. Thankfully my family got involved and I was able to be released. 

       Now, I’m going through this whole process with the school to let me be re-admitted. This all for them to cover their asses, I mean how would it look if people found out students were ending up in the hospital? I haven’t been able to return to my dorms at all except for a quick 15 minutes to get “small, essential” items. I haven’t been able to see my roommates, lay on my bed, go back to campus, attend my last 2 finals. I feel like I became a shell. My life completely changed over a stupid decision that was made in less than 30 minutes. The medication and amount I took wasn’t even lethal. I’m trying so hard to find the strength and get through this, but honestly it’s hard. I just needed to vent and since I frequented this sub a lot I thought this might be the best place to put it. Thank you all."
948,Feel like vomiting,"Can’t even think straight right now but I just fucking hate this and I’m tired of being this way and I’m not going to do it anymore. I tried to kill myself in October, got caught, and was sent to the ER for a psych evaluation, which turned into explaining why my parents were mailed a hospital bill. If there were ever a catalyst to accept responsibility and improve, that should’ve been it. But, surprise, I’m still a worthless piece of shit. Quit going to therapy because it was more frustrating than anything, gave up on taking my medication because it only makes me crazy or numb, and spent the last month sleeping. Now I’ve failed every class this semester due to absences. I’m not doing this song and dance for the thousandth time—listening to someone say how “it gets better,” how core issues with my identity and character will disappear just because time is moving. And clearly I’m not forcing any change. So, I’m done."

953,Slowly but steadily losing hope,"I'm 19, I've been depressed, self harming, and on and off starving since I was 12. Objectively my life is great. I'm healthy, fairly attractive, my parents are together, I come from a rich family, and I'm at a top college making good grades and on track to be a doctor. Yet for some reason I'm such an ungrateful piece of shit that I can't appreciate any of that and I want to die constantly. 

I just always feel like I'm not a real person. Everyone else seems to glide easily through social interactions like they have some organ that I don't. I fuck stuff up and embarrass myself every time I open my mouth. I'm just a pathetic excuse for a human being and member of society. I have intrusive sexual thoughts and super fucked up kinks. I'm supposed to be a Christian, but I've had premarital sex and fantasize about people of the same sex, so I'm probably doomed. Whenever I pray God never seems to hear or answer, although all the Christians I know swear he does. My friends always have better friends than me. We have awkward silences despite having been close for 3 years. I've only had one s.o., but he only cared about sex. He promised we'd still be friends, but he barely talks to me now despite us living in the same apartment, and when I told him I was suicidal again he literally didn't even say anything. 

I get anxiety in every single social situation and people think I'm weird because I barely say a word, or I overshare some embarrassing fact, or I say something awkward or mumble so quietly they can't hear me. Then I beat myself up for it afterwards, sometimes I cut my thighs but lately it doesn't make me feel better anymore. I cry everyday and it's hard to get out of bed and function. I know an adult shouldn't be this fragile. Maybe I have brain damage, or maybe my extreme helicopter parents were too hard on me as a kid. I just never think I'll be able to make genuine connections for my whole life, or be a good/normal person, and I don't see the point of living. I'll never belong anywhere, and I'll never be happy. I've told a couple friends how I feel and they tell me I seem normal, and they don't seem to care that I want to kill myself. Every time I seem to make progress towards acting like a non socially inept person, I blow it somehow.  I want to make some kind of positive impact on the world, and I tell myself that I'm trying to be as kind as I can to everyone, but so far I'm just taking up space and being a weird nuisance towards all the people in my life. Comparing myself to my peers, I realize i'm just not a strong, smart, or kind enough person to ever justify the space I occupy, i.e. become a respectable human being.

I've fantasized about killing myself for years, but I haven't done it because my parents would be upset, and because I'm scared I'd go to hell for it. But I pray every day and night that god will kill me painlessly to put an end to my pointless suffering. The moment my folks pass away, Im probably going to start convincing myself to hook a tube up to the exhaust and go quietly, like a pussy, the same way I lived."
954,I wanted to kill myself but my family doesnt wanted it to happen to me but they treated my like shit until now,"Im a 16 year old male teenager who really lobes to play games but, since when i was in grade school my parents and my brothers treat me like in some sort of an orphan or an animal. They throw every single possible thing that they see near st them to me. I even got bruises and internal bleedings that lead me to go to the emergency room. They blame me for that if I didnt do this thing that for me is not benifiting, they will beat me up with an arnis (a thick round stick that is used as a weapon on a filipino martial arts) and punch me right into the stomach.

It always haunting me and they still even call me, ""abnoy"" (abnormal), ""bobo"" (dumb),  and ""tanga"" (stupid) 'till this day. They tild me if I dont have high grades they would kill me and so they did. I only got like an average of 87 and my mother shouts at me and my father beats me up. My brothers always blames me for the bad things that happens in their lives even though i'm not even related to it. 

Even on my birhtday, my special day. They treat my shit as well but they will buy some cake and give it to me like what? To forgive them, no! They ruined my entire fucking life and now i'm pissed at myself on why am I still alive.

I tried to commit suicide by hanging but they say my cabinet with a hangman's knot and they scolded at me but still after i remove the thing and in the next day, they still treated me like shit.

Can somebody please help me to get out of this shit hole. My friends are fake and they always teases me."

956,Self harm and suicide attempt failure regret rant,"Does anyone else think “weak little bitch” and “why not add a few more” when ever they see their scars out of the corner of their eye?

(For context)
I have scars on my lower forearms, all of my legs, and a bit of my stomach, but the only really “bad” scars I have are the three on each arm going from wrist to elbow from my most recent suicide attempt. I haven’t cut my arms in weeks but there’s been fresh cuts on my legs every night since Wednesday because finals are really stressful. I always wear baggy jeans and hoodies to hide the scars because I’m grossed out at myself by them. 

Earlier today I was watching YouTube when out of the corner of my eye I see the beginnings of the 3 big cuts on my right arm. At that point all I could think about was how weak I was. How I had made everything worse by doing what I did that day. How weak I was compared to everyone else. And how I should add more scars to my arms. I’ve been in such a constant slum the rest of the day and now really want to cut my arms. 

The reason I stopped cutting my arms is because they was so hard to hide in ETT (emergency trauma technician. Entry level for the paramedic career path) and my friends were getting suspicious after I had “stopped” two months prior (I stopped for like two weeks but had a really bad relapse that started my use of razors instead of the knife that was taken from me) but kept wearing sleeves. 

I’m still not on medicine for my depression, schizophrenia, or anxiety (because my parents are assholes that don’t give a fuck about me as long as I get a good job and finish high school with straight A’s). So everything seems so pointless. I know what I messed up during my last attempt (doing it at the school football field during lunch even though the hospital is LITERALLY ACROSS THE STREET) and how to actually succeed this time. I haven’t made any serious plans that I plan on fallowing through but I am making hypothetical plans that I could do."

Save up the money of necessary, travel if necessary. Use the last fight in you because they could save your life and people may not know of other treatments like this. Please and there is propofol treatment coming through which has had amazing results for people like us."

If I called 911 and said ""I think I'm going to jump in front of the train"" what happens then? Do they help you? I'm really anticipating Dec 22 (my birthday) to be difficult, I feel like it's a milestone year but all I have to reflect on is failure and loneliness."
964,Cant do it,"Every single day I think about killing myself. I don't know what to do. I can tell my husband is getting sick of how I am. I'm so exhausted mentally, I want it to end. I don't want to be like this anymore. I have 3 children 3 and under. I stay home with them because we cant afford childcare, but I'm about to start working nights so we have more money. I'll get like 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night. I don't want to do this. I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to hurt my kids, but somedays I feel like I hurt them more by being here. I snap at them so much. I don't want to. I don't want to ruin them or their childhood. I don't want to take care of them while I'm exhausted physically and mentally. 

My husband says their mental health is more important. I do agree. I do. It's just so hard to push mine to the side. Whenever I try to talk to him about it he acts like I'm going to starve them or not change their diapers. He keeps bugging me to take them to the park when I can barely muster the will to leave my bed. I feed them, I clothe them, bathe them and change them. I try to keep them entertained. On my bad days he'll tell them ""don't look at her, she'll yell at you"" ""don't do anything or she'll yell at you"" and I know he's just saying those things because he's upset that I'm not in a good mood. How can I be in a good mood when I wake up every day wanting to die?? I'm shaking right now so badly I can barely type because I'm so upset. He thinks I'm a terrible mom and he shows it. I don't want to live like this anymore. 

I have therapy starting soon. I just need to hang on until then. They didn't have any openings for so long though. It's taking so long and I'm so desperate to escape the way I feel."

I feel very empty and alone right now. I haven't seen my parents since that incident 4 years ago, I'll be going to visit them in a few days. I feel so ashamed that I'll that I've done is hide and drink. 

Every day I think about killing myself. But after landing in the hospital for 6 months the first time, and seeing my mom and how she handled it, I just couldn't do that to her. 

I'm so ashamed that it makes me ashamed. I wish that I could restart. I wish that I could turn back time. I wish that I wasn't me.

I'm so sorry that I exist. Please forgive me for being alive. I hope that I can pull my shit together when I see my mom and make it seem like I'm doing alright. 

Just a small rant. I just want to do the right thing. She's had a fucking hard life. And I'm making it worse. I need to do the right thing.

I’m at my limit. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore because nothing gives me satisfaction or pleasure like it used too before. Everything is blank and... grey.

969,I've lost everyone. I don't know how to live anymore,"My eldest son was from a previous relationship and was turning 18 the day after my mother's passing. 
When my son was younger (8-15) we didnt have a great relationship, and blamed me for his father leaving, as that is what his father told him. He hated me. However, he was really close with my mother. 
My Mum could always calm him down. They had a really special bond, much stronger then the one I had with him, so from the age of 9-16 he lived 5 days a week with my mother and the weekend with me. 
This helped, we noticed him doing better in school and on the weekends our relationship slowly grew.
On his 16th birthday he moved back in with me, as we both decided we could get along, and we did. It was exactly how it should have been, he still visited his grandma every day after school every day for at least an hour. 
(Sorry for unneeded info, I really need to speak my mind and it is really scrambled at the moment) 

Fast forward to the day my Mum died. She had a heart attack. When I found out, I immediately thought of my son. I got him out of school, and broke the news to him. I saw his soul shatter, in front of my eyes. It was awful. I'll never forget that moment. He walked off and asked me to leave him alone. 
I called a therapist friend the moment he left. One hour goes past, so I phoned him. No answer. I phone family and friends and ask if anyones seen him. No one had seen him. 
We lived backed onto a wooded area and I knew my son sometimes went up there to revise. I walk into the woods. Within one minute I saw him, hanging. No note. Nothing. I cant describe that feeling. I cant even try. 

I feel empty, I feel nothing at all. Food has no taste activities have no joy. Nothing. I'm lost. The two most important people in my life died. In the same day.

This was totally fine until a couple years ago when all of a sudden it wasn't. I tried going to social clubs, hobbies and singles events a few times but I was just too scared to connect. 

Something is wrong with me, like I have a piece missing somewhere. 

I've been to therapy for a couple years, tried around 5 different anti-depressants (currently taking effexor) and I want out. I quit my monotonous, soul-destroying job that I barely survive on a couple months ago and it's just a matter of time before I'm homeless. I have no friends and I've lost contact with family a long time ago.

I don't have any rope but I have this long extension cord so I'm planning on tying it to a tree and hanging myself. Maybe put padding like a towel so there's not too much pain on my neck. Try to place pressure on the arteries in the neck to cause unconsciousness that way rather than straight strangulation."
972,What would be the best way to commit suicide that would convince others think that your suicide was an accidental death?,
973,Being too stupid to get out of poverty,I have failed my parents. I am failing my classes because I'm too stupid to make it into my dream career. I've literally wanted this job all my life but I can't make it through a single class. I am such a useless dumb piece of shit I wanna kill myself. If I grow the balls to do this I will do it before next year comes
974,Help me,So I started talking to this girl for a while now and she like the star in my sky. Absolutely amazing person with a strong drive and smarts. Our personalities complement each other’s. We got super close now and she has opened up to me about a suicide promise to her self. I am somewhat of a believer in soulmates and I think I’m gonna lose mine soon. I don’t know what I can do. She is super calm about it and told me that it’s months away like it was nothing. I don’t know what to do. Please help. I already feel the anxiety kicking in and I don’t want her to die.
975,Tired of my stupidity and bad luck,"Moved into my own 1bedroom from roommates due to stress and my mental health issues,

Chose a cockroach and possibly bedbug infested apartment, moved again and possibly carried bed begs to apartment I'm in now. Caused a fuss about the heating which was low, then bedbug scare which I later said was allergies but might still be bedbugs, then broke toilet pump since it was making noise all the time ( I have noise sensitivity, doesnt help with loud person above ).
So the management will likely evict me and say my unit is messy which it's not, 

Also my job is way too much for me, looks like I won't make probation even if I go part time now.
Luckily I have some savings built but not much, and I don't know what apartment I should get next since I don't know how much will be making and also don't know how to get rid of bedbugs if I have them.

I just feel so dumb and unlucky, my first time trying to be independent and I'm fucking it up. I'm so scared it will get worse, not sure I could emotionally handle that. No friends or family, just want to leave but every other Canadian city is insanely expensive for rent, has a lack of jobs, bad transit and overall boring. Just feel there's no escape and I'm tired of being between my bad decisions and bad luck."
976,How Should I Write My Suicide Note?,"Hi, Reddit. Considering when I joined Reddit, I never thought I'd be here, asking this question, but here we are. 

I've attempted suicide a few times in the past. The first 3 took place over the span of, I wanna say, a week. I didn't leave a note, didn't say anything, just attempted and no one knew until my mom realized I was missing vials of insulin. The 4th, I tried the ""swallowing a shitton of pills"" method, but was stopped 15 pills in because I sent individual goodbye texts to my family members and my dad figured me out. 

I don't want to be stopped this time, I want to just go away, you know? But I'm awful at writing letters, I always have been, and I don't know what to put in a suicide note. If anyone has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it."
977,Is there really truly no solution to get better?,I have been thinking about this for a months now and I think if you cant help yourself I don't think you can go much further even if you make the slightest changes or even the tiniest changes. I have tried to get better by myself and even help myself but every time I try to do that I feel like I actually accomplished nothing like literally nothing even my brain doesn't know how to learn. Maybe everyone is against me? or maybe I am just not allowed to be happy at all. I really want to be happy and learn but I just cant do that no matter what I do or try. I really wish I can fix my past or at least use a time machine.
978,.,"when should i end myself
tell me when"
979,I just registered to become an organ donor,"Hey, at least my organs will go to someone worthy and deserving of living a long, prosperous and happy life"
980,If I feel nothing why do I still feel death calling me?,"Ever since I was young I've felt like I've been living outside of myself. I'm not sure how to explain the feeling besides to tell thau imagine your body as a remote control car or like if you were playing a game knowing you're just sitting in your chair as a story works its way out infront of you

Some times it even feels like I'm dreaming- there's many times I've had to check myself in class or at the store to see if I'm awake

Though as of late things have...well they haven't gotten worse technically but not much better. I still get crushing dick rattling waves of sadness but even then when I'm crying on my kitchen floor I feel like I'm standing somewhere else just watching

I emote but there's just a layer inside of me tht those emotions can't get past- a layer of authenticity like the tingling feeling that reminds you that an immersive film is only the world infront of you not around you

This has lead to prett big social issues. Everyone wants to get to know me because well when they speak to me I know all the right things to say to make them laugh, make them trust me, I have a good few stories or two, and I even have had people admire me but it all feels so artificial

When people tell me to tell me about myself it's like I have nothing to reach for- what you see is what you get 

I know the feeling to wish you couldn't feel a thing but really I just kind of want to die. I don't know why- I don't feel sad right now but I want out- it frustrates me that I'm here and it disgusts me that two people decided to concieve me out of their own selfish desires well I feel I would but under that its just all so gray....

Maybe it's my medicine- Maybe it's my work life- maybe it's because the sky is blue

But I hate this feeling. That if I wanted to I could get up and just leave my body- that I react but don't feel it- that I really can't put myself in others shoes as easily as everyone else can because really? I'm just not here.
Its like you can see and touch me and I can touch and see you but I'm just a figment of my imagination

I sit back and let my house of cards I worked so hard to set up crumble. Every buisness contact- every opprutunity every little thing that would signal I'm worthwhile I just watch fall 

Because I'm not afraid- none of it's there either 

Because nothing can go wrong or right just forward

Sometimes for brief periods I dillude myself because of these ""slips"" as I call them. The moments where I fall out of my own perspective and watch myself. I've entertained the thought that I was hypnotized, hallucinating reality, and even threw around the possibility of being god 

I can't feel much. Not down to the core but I am afriad 

I can't feel and yet I would love nothing more than to die

What's wrong with me?
Help?"

982,these are my last days.,"i don’t want to hurt the ones i love. my daughter, my partner, my dog. they will be sad if i leave. honestly i’m really sad just thinking about it. i’m just in so much pain. i’m really poor. i work as a cashier at a fast food restaurant and get constantly harassed. i live in a poor neighborhood and hear gunshots and screams all the time. the air taste like coal and car exhaust. my family abandoned me after coming out as transgender. i don’t like being transgender. i didn’t choose this. i’m becoming deeply paranoid people are out to hurt me and bad things keep happening. i’m 4 years sober and everyone i know drinks alcohol. they seem unaware of everything around them. i try and tell them about how i feel but it’s pointless. they get upset and end up causing more problems. so i’ve basically isolated. i don’t leave my house anymore. which soon i won’t be able to afford. everything seems to be falling apart. i know this post will just go ignored. or some troll will figure out a way to make me feel worse without looking too insensitive. it’s all very overwhelming. so i’ve made a noose. i’ve studied in great detail how to hang myself. i don’t want to fail this time. it’s my 4th attempt. this time i will choose the most lethal method possible and be sober. i’m going to give it a few days to be sure this is what i want but this is months of planning. i wanted to do it on christmas because i hate the holiday so much. i’m sure i’ll be called a cry baby. be told i’m selfish. you can say whatever you’d like. i’ll be dead. so whatever you wanna call me is pointless because i’ll be a ghost. just another loser disappearing into the void. you won’t miss me."
983,Sorry,"im sorry i keep posting here but i have nowhere to go. its so pathetic that this is like an outlet to me. i have probably posted 4 times, each time i post i feel worse i feel like im giving up on myself its like im so sad i feel cold i havent really moved for 3 days besides going to work i just want to die"
984,How feasible is suicide by a combination of a lot of alcohol and a lot of xanax?,"I'd add opioids to the combo but I don't have access to any. I have super easy access to xanax and alcohol, so could I combine a lot of both and die that way? Seems like it could be a relatively peaceful way to go. If not I'm beyond really caring about that all I care about now is effectiveness. I can't take another day of this world but every method doesn't fucking work"
985,It’s hard to keep going,"Drugs don’t help my shit life anymore. Life has never been kind to me, since birth I’ve been in hell. I can’t fucking take it. The only good thing that helped me tolerate life betrays me. I want to die but not by my own hand. I have reasons to live. But my will to wait it out dwindles. Sweet release would be so easy. It would be so easy."
986,Attempted to kill my self earlier in the week idek why I’m still trying to hold on.,"22 m, I just got tired left my house without saying anything to anyone, drove out somewhere quite, put a belt around my neck and tried to hang myself in the back of my car.

The first time the knot slipped off so I tried again. I didn’t feel like I was doing the wrong thing at any point but at the same time I couldn’t stop feeling guilty about how hurt my ex would be when she found out. And in the end I couldn’t do that to her. 

I ended up calling her and telling her what happened and we sat in my car crying for a few hours before I calmed down enough to go home and sleep. 

Couple days after I tell my mom what happened since she kept asking why I got back so late. I tried calling a crisis line cause I have no idea what to do, they tell me go to A&amp;E to get assessed which ends up being some lady telling me attempting suicide is silly thing to do and getting mad at me for not having an answer for why I’m depressed or have been for the last 10 years. I leave with a leaflet and get told to see my GP next week but honestly I just don’t see a point and I don’t think it will help.

I’ve tried medication, counselling, cbt, diet changes, exercise, going out with people, moving countries, pot, meditation, volunteering, tried to start studying again, and some alternative healing stuff 

Nothings helped so far, at the most it’s felt a temporary fix that has no benefit to the problem.  

I thought I’d kill myself by 18 and I’m still here with no idea what the heck I’m doing or even what I’m interested in and struggle to maintain an interest/attention on stuff and usually end up feeling bored quickly. 

Life in general is well dull/boring/predictable/repetitive for the most part and I can’t stand how fake it feels. I try to do different things, go different places, meet new people. But it’s the same wherever you go or what you do. Only thing that changes is the scenery, what people look like and some of the details of the script you call life. It makes me lose motivation in doing anything. It feels like I’m in a dark room running on the spot trying to reach that non existent light.

I’m lost, tired and giving up. I should just end my life properly and stop worrying about someone I’m not with and has moved on."
987,I don't know what to title this.,"Before the depression hit in Oct 2018 I would scoff at others in this situation. Sometime around then I got mega depressed, like not move from the bed depressed. Almost failed high school. Got on prozac and it helps but goddamn the bad feelings come in hard.

I feel like a burden to my family. Its been 7 months since I graduated high school and I have no job. The only time I did was literally for 4 hours before I passed out from over-exertion. Im like 5 8 or 10 or something its been a while since ive checked at 315lbs. Every time someone mentions something or jokes about me being jobless makes me get unbareably off center. Its been building for months now, and I just cannot stand it anymore. My friends are assholes and I can't leave them because they are the only people I can take refuge from my family to. I don't like the whole being comepletely alone thing, couldn't do it. The stress keeps building and building and it feels like this dam is about to explode and on the other side is going to be my insides flowing out. 

I have never felt this way before really, but everywhere I turn I see potential ways to end it and its ruining my life even further the longer im awake. This sucks."
988,Stay alive just one more moment,"I know it’s hard everyone on here.  I haven’t suffered like most of you and for that reason I consider myself so lucky. Please do your best to just stay alive another day, another week, another hour, whatever it is. There’s no one in the world that someone won’t miss. Eventually, many people find happiness and/or a reason to live, it may take years, but trust me it’s worth it. Life isn’t easy at all, but over time, you can be healed. So much of life is so beautiful, please do yourself a favour, and just hold on, any extra second you can, until you find that reason to live. I know I sound crazy or stupid, but you can do it. I promise"
989,its getting so bad again,"only 2 people in the world know about my failed attempts and when i try to talk to those same people they say ""idk what to tell u"""
990,Feeling abandoned after an attempt.,"Not entirely sure if this is the place to post this, but here we are. On the 23rd of November 2019, I attempted suicide via overdose on the rooftop of my apartment. Earlier that day my two roommates and I had a discussion to see how we were all feeling about the general tone of the apartment. In the month previous, I had finally run out of money and was unable to make rent. I had solved that problem by taking a job I hated and working the graveyard shift. For context, I had recently moved to that city and was unable to find employment at all. They're both full-time students at the local college, and both work an additional \~10 hours a week at internships, in one of their cases, his grandparents pay his rent and tuition. In this period of unemployment, I agreed to take on the majority of the housework, but as soon as I started working till 3:00 A.M. every day I became less and less reliable and willing to do my assigned duties. Our discussion about the tone of the apartment turned quickly into a ""One of us has to move out"" type discussion and they both agreed it should be me. I was given a month to find new housing. I discovered later that this was a decision they had agreed on previously, which shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did because I had woken up to them talking unkindly about me on a couple of occasions. As it stands, I got low and didn't see an out so I waited till they left for something, went to the rooftop of my apartment, and over the course of an hour downed an entire bottle of high strength Tylenol and 3 beers. A fair few folks called and texted me attempted to locate me, and I am happy they did, but I didn't respond. I called the suicide hotline after I took the pills so I could hear a friendly voice before passing out. I woke up later in the ambulance and spent 3 days in the ICU. I texted folks to let them know I'm ok a few days later. Everyone was glad I was alright, but after that, absolutely no one has attempted contact with me. Am I justified in feeling abandoned and that it might not have had that much impact if I hadn't wound up in that ambulance? Thanks for reading."
991,STOP IT STop,I WANT TO END IT ALL JUST END IT JUST END IT JUST END IT JUST END IT JUST END IT IT WOULD BE BETTER I WAS FUCKING GONE FROM THIS USELESS WORLD IM A FUCKING WASTE OF SPACE AND A WASTE OF FUCKING MONEY I SHOULD JUST OVERDOSE ON THOSE ANTIDEPRESSANTS THAT DONT FUCKING HELP BECAUSE THEN THEYLL BE WORKING WHEN IM DYING JUST END IT JUST END IT JUST END IT
992,Ive lost all my friends,"A stupid argument lead to my friends talking among themself and finding out that ive always been annoying and a piece of shit. After 4 years of fighting depression, getting fires, but finding this new feiende group and now that life started to go up, it punches me down again and i cant take it anymore. Last time i called the cops on myself. Not this time"
993,I don't have a reason.,"Or maybe I have too many reasons? No single thing is going so wrong in my life that I want to die, but it's all compounded. I've been stuck in a rut for years, I don't have friends, I hate my job, I'm out of shape. None of that would be enough by itself. But I feel like I try to work on one thing and I get too exhausted and dragged down by the rest of it.

I don't know. i just so, so don't want to do this anymore. ""It gets better"" isn't true for everyone. I wish I'd died when I attempted. I really do."
995,i want to resort to drinking,"please excuse my constant posting. i’m just venting because anyone else i’ve talked to about this i’ve either really regretted it because i seem weak, or they just did not give a shit. 

i’ve been so down in my life recently and although it’s not the worst i’ve ever been, i’m having thoughts about resorting back to my old numbing habits. i used to drink as a way to numb myself but i haven’t in about three years because i got a lot better. 

im not okay right now though. i’ve tried healthy ways of letting my emotions out like talking to friends but they don’t give a flying fuck. they only come to me when it’s about them, or when they need something. i feel so fucking useless all the time and i constantly compare myself to everyone just like back then. my old thoughts are resurfacing, looking to bad habits as an escape to numb myself. i never wanted to go back to this and i never thought i would but at this point i don’t care about myself anymore. i’m not pretty at all compared to every other girl, i really played myself for a guy who doesn’t even think about me, the friends i had for years are beginning to turn on me and talk shit about me literally to my face, i’m doing bad in school, i have no redeeming qualities and i’m being reminded of that now. i finally realized i serve no purpose but to entertain people. to be made fun of. to be looked at as a helpless girl who can’t do shit in life. no one has ever truly been proud of me. no one. everyone fucking turns on me and i sound so pathetic but it’s because i am. i can’t feel pure happiness anymore and i forget all of my happy memories because bad ones always flood my mind nowadays. i think the last time i really did feel happy was in april of this year. i was so blind. 

to think anyone would even give me a chance at anything... here i was thinking i was smart, worthy of love, that i was ever pretty. i’m not. i faked everything until i convinced myself it was true. i had such good confidence and i loved myself. now i fucking despise my body, my face, myself. i really did think multiple guys liked me, any form of attention boosted my confidence and my heart fluttered every time the guy i liked even looked my way. i was ecstatic when i answered a question correctly in class. i was so happy. 

now i want to sit in my bed and sleep, or drink. that’s all i want to do now. i can’t turn back time, i can’t change the past, i can’t undo my shitty mistakes."
996,oh well,i don’t think anyone would care if i was gone
997,Please help,"I'm on a tablet and I can't call for help.
I just tried to strangle myself with a belt on my bunk bed. My father started to play his radio in the other room so I stopped.. I felt guilty
I need help, I'm scared of myself, I used to do self harm. Right now I want to give my life another shot."
998,Losing it,"I’m thinking of taking pills and ending it all
My birthday is tomorrow, I’ve never felt like I’d make it to 20, I always thought I’d be dead by then. Tonight I feel like ending it. 

My mom is a piece of selfish shit, my dads too far gone, I’m not close to my siblings, I don’t have a best friend or any friends for that matter. I’ve been depressed since I was 12, since my grandmother passed life doesn’t seem like it’s worth living.  

No one really seems to admire me or truly want me in their life, nothing special about me, I don’t have anything outstanding at all about me. Probably why my bf doesn’t want to fully commit, probably why my dad rather be on his phone than spend any real time with me, probably why my mom abused me, probably why I have no friends, probably why I hate myself. 

It’d be so easy to take the 2 whole bottles of medicine my doctor prescribed me for some pain I had in my arm. To write everyone a honest and truthful note about how it’s not their fault, how no one could’ve done anything, how much I wanted to be ok but I’m just not. Only thing stopping me is being scared it’ll be painful. 

I don’t want to vomit the pills up, if I don’t die I can’t afford the hospital bill cause I have no insurance. I don’t want anyone to think I’m weak or crazy for wanting to kill myself.. it’s just I have no one.. life is full of negatives to me, nothing gets better. I just wanted to feel admires, loved, genuine love. I’ve never had love, I thought my bf genuinely loved me,  but I think he just stays with me because it’s convenient. He’s not physically attracted to me, he’s not romantic, but he’s my everything. So if he doesn’t even admire me when I thought he did, who will?"
999,Overwhelming Grief,"I watched my mom die of a heart attack 13 years ago in January. I'm 26 and this upcoming anniversary is hanging over my head. I have a lot of dreams where she is still alive. They're so vivid and real that when I wake up, I am retraumatized all over again. I miss her so much. She never got to see me graduate high school. I want to see her again on a more permanent basis, but I'm too fucking chicken to actually kill myself. I'm done being here. I'm a disappointment and embarrassment to my family. When my mom had her heart attack, we would have been driving on the interstate so I'm probably not supposed to be alive. I'm feeling so numb right now. I tried watching a movie to try and feel better, but I felt nothing when it was over. I don't want to try anymore. I just want to die so my life insurance money will pay off the rest of my debts and I can be at peace. What do I do?"
1000,I'm indecisive,"I told myself I'd make myself go forward and not commit suicide if I passed every class this semester. I also told myself that if I didn't pass all of them, I would. Now I'm thinking maybe I should either. I know my boyfriend will be sad and my son will cry for me but they'll get over it. My boyfriend can do so much better than me. He already has in his past. My son won't even remember me. Whoever my boyfriend would end up with, he would make sure she's a good mother to our son. I haven't even been in his life for very long.

I shouldn't drag put the inevitable. My death is inevitable. My depression is inescapable. I've been trying. I just feel more tired every day that passes. I'm just too tired to keep going."
1001,i have nothing.,"im a worthless person that shouldnt have ever been born. 
i cant hold a job, i have no talents, and an abundance of mental and physical problems that just make me even more of a drain to society and everyone around me. i take whats prescribed to me to survive a day and still cant do it without smoking pot every minute of the day i possibly can. ive failed to kill myself multiple times because not even that i can do right. 
no one needs me. everyone would be happier if i just never existed in the first place. 
i wish i could just disappear completely."
1002,Will antihistamines work? I just want to go because it’s better for everyone if I go.,
1003,I don’t know what to do,"I just can’t stand living any longer.

Everything is the same, the same pain, same problems, same life, I’m so sick of it. Why do I have to live....?

I’m worthless, I have no real value to society or to my family, everything would be better off if I could kill myself, but I can’t.

I wish I could express myself better but I can’t... it’s so hard!

I’m so sorry... I just wanted to say this out loud... I just want to scream."
1004,The future keeps getting more apparent,"I've been a frequent user of suicide hotlines and places like this. I've heard every canned line there is for kind hearted people to deliver. But things don't always get better. Sometimes things can't get better.  

I've become increasingly inhuman. I am totally isolated now and have no ability to reconnect to any fraction of society. People cant stand being around me. I can see my strangeness makes them physically uncomfortable.  As years have gone on like this I've started losing hope that I'll ever be human again. The more isolated I become the worse off my social skills. The worse my social skills the more isolated I become. I've trapped myself in countless failures. I'm dead already, so why not blow my brains out? I don't have the courage to bear that pain yet, but have reached the point that I know it's the only way my life could end. 

Had to get that off my chest. Thank you."
1005,Does anyone else feel like they HAVE to attempt suicide or at least be checked into a psychiatric hospital to be taken seriously?,"It’s not like breaking a bone. If I tell people what’s going on, I get a “yeah I feel that” or “mood” ffs dude I want to stop breathing."
1006,i feel even worse than before and i don’t know what to do with myself anymore,"i was having a great weekend with my best friend who makes me laugh despite me feeling like shit all the time. but when i got home i was feeling really paranoid about school but i checked my grades anyway and holy shit, my heart sank and i felt like throwing up. for weeks now i haven’t been checking because of genuine fear of seeing unsatisfying grades. for these past few weeks i’ve been feeling so unmotivated to even go to school so you can imagine how i feel with turning things in. i used it be such a smart student, i’m in advanced classes and my family sees me as the smarter child. but lately i don’t want to do anything in my life ever again, i’m so scared of my teachers and i struggle to keep up with classes so much and i hate myself. last year i was doing so well with everything but now i feel so fucking stupid all the time compared to my classmates. i don’t want to try anymore. my SAT scores were lower than my friends, and overall my friends are just getting better grades. i feel so useless. i want to die because school was kind of the only good thing i had. i have no other talents because i’m just useless. and i’m fucking stupid for complaining about this shit. no duh i’m doing bad because i can’t even turn things in on time anymore. i want to cry every time i walk to school. my teachers terrify me because i seem like a terrible student now. how the hell do i fix this?? i can’t go back now, my last quarters grades started off great but kept slipping more and more towards the end of the quarter. i was so ashamed. i don’t even want to try in life anymore. i hate living so much and yeah this seems so petty but school was a distraction to me but now i wake up in cold sweats thinking of school at night, i get really bad paranoia during school, constantly itching to check my grades even though it’ll make me feel worse. i make excuses as to why i cant get things done and i hate it. i shouldn’t be like this. i’m not supposed to be like this. my friends are so much better than me. my classmates are superior to me. i shouldn’t try but i want to make my family proud. i don’t think they ever really were though. this is the last week before winter break starts and i already had a breakdown in the shower tonight. i want to do well in life. i just cant get out of bed and fucking do anything, because i’m so worthless. i dont even know what happened to me. some of my friends constantly make me feel like shit. my teachers always favor other students. everyday is a fucking cycle for me. i come home from school and feel exhausted and just go to sleep to ignore the worrying thoughts in my head. ‘do your homework’, ‘make some work up’, ‘study for this test and DON’T half ass it like you always do’. but in the end i push everything down. i haven’t told anyone about these feelings. i just hate myself so much and i wish i could go back in time and restart everything, all over these fucking grades. my head is always full of regret."
1007,Society is driving me to suicide,They want me dead.
1008,I won’t be around for too long,"I told my two friends that I won’t be seeing them for a long time because I’m too emotionally draining. What I meant to tell them is I’ll probably never see them again. I appreciate them and the chances they’ve given me but I don’t deserve any of it. I feel bad I’m going to go without saying goodbye to them but I really don’t want to scare them. They’re pretty much all I had, but now nothing is standing in my way of suicide. I don’t know when I’m going to do it but I know I will. I plan on either overdosing on my hydroxyzine or hanging myself. Maybe both lmao."
1009,Anyone else wish they could hire someone to kill them?,"I wish it were that easy. How do you go about finding the person? How much would it cost? I'm such a pussy, I could never do it myself. Wish I had the ability to just pay someone a few hundred bucks and put a bullet in my head. Then I'd have been murdered and my family wouldn't have to live with the burden of me having killed myself."
1010,I killed a mouse and smashed a bottle over my head and broke my dad when he tried to carry my limp body,It’s the second time I’ve gotten drunk and accidentally mishandled a pet mouse to death. Last time I sent myself to the hospital for the weekend to not hurt or kill myself and it didn’t help and was all round uncomfortable. This time I have cuts on my head I have to explain at work and I injured my dad. I should be killed. I cause suffering to everything. I can’t even have pets. I will kill them because I’m so stupid and ill. I don’t even care if I have a fatal head injury but I’d never be so lucky.
1011,"Tomorrow I start therapy again. If I don't get any better, I'll have to end my life.","Been struggling with depression since I was 17 (I'm 25 now) but the past two years have been especially difficult and I've been having thoughts every day about ending my life. I do desperately want things to get better and to overcome this, which is why I'm going to give this last attempt at therapy everything I have, but if nothing changes then I'll have no option but to end my life. I'm determined to try my very best to improve the way I see myself and build my confidence but if I see no change then I'd rather end it than continue to live miserably."
1012,Not so Happy Holidays,"I'm finally had enough, no matter what I know that I will take my life soon. I plan on waiting until January 2nd, just so I don't ruin the holidays for everyone else. I will write to have myself cremated so it is less expensive and make sure that the people I want to have my things will have them.... Is there anything else I should plan beforehand?
I don't want to spill my whole story here, and this isn't really about sympathy I just want to put this out into the void since I can't really tell anyone else"
1013,I can't think of even one reason to not kill myself.,"I'm being forced to choose between living on the streets or letting my abuser back into my home. I'd much rather be dead than deal with either of the two. I don't want to put up with the bs of going from shelter to shelter, working my ass for a job that won't pay me enough to even cover a subleased room, and balancing all of my high school course work on top of that. 

With that being said, what OTC drugs would you guys recommend I use to do it? I'm scared of irreversible damage from a failed attempt, so something surefire to work please."
1014,My suicidal depression is coming back and I don't know what to do about it.,"Sorry for the long post:  I am a 24 y.o. man. I have had occasional suicidal thoughts since I was 18. In 2018, I made a an attempt but told no one because I didn't fully go through with it. 

I finally got diagnosed with a panic/ anxiety disorder this year because I feel into the worst depression of my life and couldn't function properly. I attempted again in August without telling anyone. Then, at a different time in August, I was going to attempt again, but a desperate cry for help was unexpectedly answered. 

My situation is a little different because my depression is caused by anxiety/ panic (and some paranoia) . I just can't seem to shake the feeling of being worthless, of being a burden on the people who care about me, the fear that no one will love me, and the fear that I will never do well in my unconventional job. 

Therapy helped, but it isn't enough. Anti-depressants make me feel sick. I don't trust my parents even though they financially help me out with some stuff. I'm so afraid that my friends hate me, even though I try to convince myself otherwise. I am moving to another city soon, so I will breakup w/ my bf. He's so amazing, but I'm scared I won't find love like that again. My job doesn't make money at the start. 

Worst of all, I don't feel like I can talk about this stuff w/ friends anymore. I cried for help this year. I have the best friends a guy could ask for, but I have trouble being honest w/ them because I hate myself so much. I don't want to bother them, even though many of my friends have told me they will listen...I still feel ashamed. 

I sometimes think that attempting is my only way to break this curse. I hate having depression so much. I don't know what to do."
1015,I just want to end it all,"Dated an abusive boyfriend, my family hate me and my only ‘friend’ now wishes me dead - I see no other reason for living, I just wish I was strong enough to do it - Idk why I’m so scared to but I believe it’ll be for the best - I think it’s my best way to find happiness"
1016,I feel broken,"Excuse my bad grammar, i am not native.
My life is shit, my mom is a psycopath, and im not using that word mildly, she is an manipulative person that me sensless for every small thing thst ever happened, my brother took the brunt for most of her beatings.
When i was six years old, i told my teacher in front of the entire class that my mother beats me, i regret that to this day, i wish i never told.
The beatings stopped after social services were contacted, exept a few random outburst, but that when the psychologi al terror begun.
All the beatings i have recieved from that woman wouldnt compare to how she treated me and my brother verbally, she would constantly pick on me and my brothers looks, and complain about everything we did, not anything helpfull though, just saying that we were ugly and she was disgraced when giving birth to us, telling us that we werent up to her standards, that we ruined her life, she would call my brother a fat piece of shit retard that nobody will ever love, she said  i should get my ass beat for just being alive.

The child protective services has been nothing but a pain, they only made matters worse, by taking us away from our father and placing us at our moms.
Teachers, family and pretty much everyone in my life at the time told them it was the wrong move, but they never listened, such to say, they probably stand behind 40% of the bullshit my childhood has been.

My father has been a saving grace, and pretty much the only guy i could rely on my entire life, he always supported me and my brother like a parent should, he always wanted to keep us with him, and away from my mom, but as my country is very sensitive about race, they opted to listen to my mom, who is a small african woman, instead of my dad, who is blonde and mildy put, menacing looking.

I am now 16 and went through a trial against the cps and my mother wich i won, but i struggle daily with getting through life, it feels like i have nobody to talk to, nobody cares about me, i feel like my life has no meaning to it.
Everyday i have the same thought, ""cant it just end?"" ""Why doesn't the pain ever stop?"" ""Can i make it stop?
To put it simply i want to die."
1017,"I’m sitting in bed, about to come down from a high. It would be so easy to slit my wrist open right now.","I’m just sitting here, in this thought, and a wave of relief washes over me. I feel completely in control for the first time in a long time. If I just cut down my arm, I could fall asleep and not feel anything. It sounds amazing

But I know that my high is about to wear off. I only have a few minutes to make a decision."
1018,I made a mistake. Pt.11 being born.,"I want to do it but I’m scared to do it. 
I want satan to kill me but I’m a afraid he’ll take me to we’re everyone burns."
1019,Need to talk to someone,Need to talk to someone. Please message me
1020,"Ah, Christmas time. What a wonderful time of year","to end it all.

I know many of you are in the same boat as I am, I absolutely hate this damn time of year. Watching everyone either be full of joy and ""Christmas spirit"" or complain that they have to spend money and time with family.

Shit sucks for those of us that don't have a family and haven't felt happiness in so long they don't remember what it feels like.

So fuck you, don't ask me what I'm doing for Christmas. Don't force me to listen to that awful goddamn music, I'll smash your fucking radio. Don't bitch to me about all the gifts you have to buy for your friends and family. And DAMN SURE don't tell me to cheer up. Go to fucking hell.

So those of you drinking tonight, pour another and say ""Fuck Christmas"" with me!"
1021,What's the point,"Why live when you could just end it right there, suffer no more, feel no more, love no more, feel like a total piece of shit no more. Everyday I look at my life and think, I don't give myself a pass on the game of life, even though I'm only 15 the world is fucking with me, school, trying to fit in, love life (I have never had a girlfriend), everyday during math class I see an alcoholic or drug addict not the teacher but future me, everyday in English class I see my old school, where I was happy, I grew up there, but my depression and suicidal thoughts started there, but in highschool I don't see shit, I only experience long term sadness and short term happiness, only when I'm in that 15 minute breakfast break. 15 FUCKING MINUTES, like school give me time to have fun expect for study like a fucking robot, I have to be programmed to learn something everyday, even though it's completely fucking useless irl, why not just end it. Why?"
1022,A couple of things:,"1) Has anyone written their Swan Song / 13 Reasons Why / Last Ditch Effort to Scream Into the Empty Void? I mean, not necessarily for anyone to read it, but just to get it out of you?

2) I've posted this before, but I just keep thinking about it... assisted suicide not being a thing is unethical. It just is. Why should someone wanting to die not be allowed to die? And if there is a facility to oversee the body after the fact and ease the actual suffering of passing, why shouldn't that be a thing? Instead there is the trauma to someone else finding the body, and the potential of failing and suffering the consequences of it. It just doesn't make sense and it's disgusting to blow it off as something that ""might get better."""
1023,Time's up,"I guess it's about time. I just need to disappear. My life is a sham and no one gives 2 shits for me. I've ruined every relationship in my life with my shit personality. I just want to die so it stops fucking hurting and I stop hurting those around me. I've hung myself before and failed. Branch broke, or belt, I don't know. Drugs and darkness means I don't really know what happened. But this time I won't fall. I don't want a funeral, I don't want a grave. Cremation and throw the ashes in the garbage with the rest of the fucking trash. Fuck you world. 1981-2019 longer than I thought I'd make it"
1024,I’m just tired of being used and abused,"I’ve been abused so many times throughout my life by people I trusted with the entirety of my soul, I think I have a drug problem....and I just want to end it all. I don’t want to live anymore"
1025,I’m done,I’m tired. I don’t want to do this anymore. I have no one I want to talk to. I’m kms. I hate everything but especially myself. Bye.
1026,Here we go again,"Here we go again
Into another shitty week
Seven more days
Of this

Here we go again
Looking for reasons to live
But finding only
More excuses to give up

Here we go again."
1027,Tired,"I'm so tired. I hate this so much. 

I'm tired of feeling like a failure. I came back from a semester off. I was ready to do better but its just been getting steadily worse. My depression came back with the vengence at the end and I couldn't eat couldn't sleep. 

I used to have nothing going for except my grades.I don't think I'll even have that anymore. 

Now since its finals and I have 2 essays do I just am so  terrified of failure that I'm paralyzed into a catatonic state. I'm sick of disappointing everyone continuously. I can't fail at killing myself because I know I'll cause more issues, but I just want to die. I think I'll do it tonight.

  
I want to be worthy of life. Of anything atleast"
1028,I tried to end it this time last week.,"I’m still trying to come to terms with my overdose and whatever permanent damage I may or may not have caused myself. I know I’ll have memory loss for a while and I’ll have trouble sleeping. A part of me is upset that it didn’t work, but an even greater part is more grateful that I survived. I didn’t expect to wake up in the hospital, but I did, and now there’s no choice but to move forward somehow. For anyone that’s struggling with this, know you’re not alone, but just consider the consequences of failing and what it’ll do to yourself and the people around you. Ending up in the hospital is a horrible experience. Please really think about it."
1029,Rant,I've made myself look like such an idiot. I've pushed away everyone who cared about me to the point where they don't care and rightfully shouldn't anymore. It's like I enjoy feeling alone. I just wish I could go through with killing myself and not be stuck here messing up my life anymore than I already have.
1030,Someone there to talk? :(,"So, i’ve been diagnosed with depression and have schizophrenia like symptoms, cant stop thinking, basically my head feels like its gonna explode any second, i’m on 30mg of lexapro for 6 weeks now but idk doesn’t do much and i cant be alone, otherwise the thinking spiral starts. If someone out there wants so call or chat, let me know :)"
1031,Ive been playing with the notion of suicide for a long time,Im 20. Im at a place right now where im full of regret and sadness. The only person who keeps me up is my girlfriend. She listens to my depressive episodes and allows me to vent her frustration. But shes getting tired of it. My friends ive either pushed away or have left me for one reason or another. My family hardly talks to me. My job depresses me and its the career i chose and cant quit due to being more of a disappointment to those around me. I cant go more than a day without worrying myself to tears over everything going on. My motivation is slipping all around me. And i cant seem to pick it back up. Im in a place where i cant pull myself out anymore. And I’ve done nothing but imagine ways to kill myself and to get out of this place I’ve put myself in my head. Am i too far gone?
1032,I’m killing myself by jumping off a high ledge AMA,No one cares I exist I failed and I’m killing myself  I’m happy to die
1033,"I'm such a disappointment to my family, I might as well disappear.","My parents love me and I love them, but I've only ever caused them problems. I'm their eldest child, and I'm the worst kid out of the entire family. I'm so fucked up, in every way possible.

I've been bullied when I was in elementary school, and it kept going in middle school. I hate myself because of that, I guess ; I can't get over it even if it was years ago. I can't forget the shame, the humiliation, the beatings, the insults, I can't forgive the teachers and the other kids for not saying anything and for never helping me.

I've been raped by my cousin when I was 13. At that time I was already being bullied, so it was just too much. I started to cut myself, and my parents noticed after a few months. But they thought I only did it to be like every other rebellious, moody kids, so they just asked me to stop and didn't do anything else than that. I almost killed myself by throwing myself out of the Window of our apartment, more than once, but I never could do it, because I didn't want my little brothers to find or see my dead body.

In high school, that's when I realized how depressed I am. My dad wanted me to be good at maths, which I wasn't, so he was very harsh with me, and because of that my parents kept arguing. My mom even said that if they ever break up it would be my fault. I was so scared, it fucked me up even more. 

I became addicted to cigarettes, then weed, in high school. I tried various things from then on. Alcohol, weed, cocaine, speed, ecstasy. I know, it's dumb. But if someone gave you happiness in a pill or in a cigarette, wouldn't you take it too?

I can never do anything right. Now at least my parents know I'm depressed, I see a psychiatrist and a therapist, but it doesn't change anything. I'm still a piece of shit, I'm still useless, I'm still a mess. I'm so fucked up and I'm only 19, goddammit. Is this what life is going to be forever for me? It's been 8 years already, and nothing changed. When will it end? I want to die so badly. There's nothing left for me on this earth. I don't believe in anything anymore. I just want to rest, please."
1034,Christmas is triggering????,"I’m actually really dreading Christmas, like I want to end it so bad but I know I can’t do it before x-mas because that would make it even worse for my family and I don’t want that for them but with everyone over it’s going to be a huge sensory overload and I’m really not looking forward to it plus everyone expects you to be happy and celebrating but I’m not and pretending Is exhausting especially around all of my extended fam"
1035,Give me a reason,"On the verge again 
Just give me a reason, just one, I don’t want hotline numbers, no textbook comments and shit like that 
Just give me a reason not to end it all
I’m fat
Stupid
Too anxious all the time
Social outcast 
Loser
“Edgy kid” 
Slow at learning (not disabled just need more time) 
And most of all I just fucking suck 
Riddled with acne, anxiety, cutting scars, tear stains, and emotional wounds as deep as bone
Give me a reason 
Just one"
1036,Today is my birthday,And I am afraid that I'll try to kill myself. I've tried a couple of times but I never succeeded. My whole life is breaking apart. I was crying so much that I can't cry anymore. I don't know what to do
1037,Don’t read this if you’re easily triggered. But I need to be heard today.,"My Dad raped me when I was 8 and he never stopped. Things escalated later and I was in a child ring for him and his friends from 13. Nobody helped me, my Mother remarried and signed over parental rights to him even though she knew he was sick sexually and on meth. Why?? His Mother- she knew, she knew and she was too scared of him. Of how that would look to the people she knew. His brothers, my cousins, their wives- they ignored it. So he did everything he could to me until I was 16 and I found a way to get out.

I’m 24 now, and my PTSD and schizophrenia are a constant reminder of everything that happened. I can’t connect with anyone or anything. I keep trying to kill myself. I kept wishing I ran away better years ago and it may have been different, but when I tried he would find me and the repercussions were horrible. I still have scars between my legs.

I want to stop the memories- but I can’t. I’m so sad."
1038,I want to kill myself but don’t know which ways are most effective,I don’t want anybody telling me not to do it or feeling bad for me in anyway I just want tips or anything that can help. I’ve done research but idk which way to try bc most of the research is confusing. I am 19 years old. Please and thank you
1039,Wrote my notes,"To whoever finds my body, to my family, and to the last girl I crushed on.  All the notes are positive and trying to absolve as much guilt as possible. I made sure to write the notes when I was in a good mood, I don’t want my suicide to be any sort of impulsive decision. Current plan; buy a gun and make it through the holidays. Still have quite a bit of cleaning to do before I go out also."
1040,People are crazy,Feeling like everyone is against me and it's making me angry
1041,I just want to see my friend again.,"It was at the beginning of this year. We were at a bar drinking and a drunk dude starting cursing at us; pissed off we both. We started a fight and beat the fuck up of him, but as they everytime walk with friends he called them, and that turned into a fuckin' mosh.
The barman called the police and just some time after I heard the shot.
We pissed off some idiots and one of them held a gun. He shot him in the head and ran away before the cops came, letting only the two of us on the street. Or one in real, just me now.
The skin of his face was burned and curled up around the bullet; the skull had a hole and the liquified brain was running out of it, mixed with liters and liters of blood. I was crying, heart-broken and eyes frozen. I just knelt beside him and wait for the Black Maria to come.

I'm not suicidal; not anymore. I want to be against violence but this is a battle I already lost. I'll never stop this, and seeing it with my eyes makes me not be able to ignore it. I don't want to ignore it.
I always was here just to create problems and more problems, I always was violent and I hurt a lot of people; but I don't really cared about it. They were weaklings.
And now, I caused it. My ""brother"" died.
We smoke weed together, we got to hoop together, we were created in the same hood since I was like, 9 years old. And now, more than 10 years later, the person I though I would never lost was died beside my knees.
I want to stop that from happening again. But for it, I need to stop people like me. I need to kill myself."
1042,Well definitely thinking about peace again today.,"So, I've had it rough guys. Pretty much screwed my whole life up these last couple of years. I've lost everything just about. Life has become dull and just utterly painful. 

I don't want to die but im deffinately tired of this shit. I've lost my creative spark, what little confidence I had in myself, I lost my family 'even though that wasn't all my fault', I've been torn in half by a covert narcissist ; I got played like a fiddle and destroyed my self. My friends are all busy with life no help there. My father passed away and every family member I have lives 1000s of miles away. 

I'm on 10 years probation and 5 years in and I currently had a mental crisis that lead to a DUI and drug possession. Of course at the time if hadn't been smoking weed and drinking I would have killed myself. I'm trying desperately not to start drinking again right now. 

I know my story is not that bad but the last 20 years of my life have taken a toll. It's been one very dark and terrible ride. Sometimes I don't even know how I'm still standing. I feel like an empty shell of a person lately. Shit I just don't know what to do anymore."
1045,Suicidal crisis over... time to plan,"I went through a few days of major distress and now that it has gone down a bit, partly because of time passing, me sleeping, and decision to acquire my means sooner than planned... I am calmly dealing with the details of whatever aftermath I am able to control. Doing this is calming because I know its 1) keeping me alive and 2) getting me closer. I feel a sense of control now. However, I am now trying to lose more weight in order for this to work better. Thats hard. I’m already underweight and malnourished. How much farther am I (personally) able to go? 

In any case, I thank everybody here and I mean EVERYBODY who replied or communicated with me while I was completely irrationally out of my mind in the last few days. I cannot thank you all enough. I have now got some vegetable broth which I will sip on bedside because warm drinks calm me down. It’s better on my stomach than coffee or tea (suspected ulcer). 

Try it out, doesn’t have to be vegetable, could be beef or chicken, but I’m vegan. The savoury aspect is kinda like popcorn at the movies."
1046,"Tired of wasting breath, tired of nothing left.","I feel like I bother people with how I feel. Losing trust because they don't know wether I'll be alive the next day or not. Or even them thinking it's just attention seeking or they call the cops. I don't talk to anyone anymore about my thoughts because I feel like I annoy them, but the thoughts persist. And I only have me now. I've gotten to the point where when I finally get the courage to do it, I won't tell anyone beforehand. I've said my goodbyes multiple times anyway."
1047,"People say that life is short, but it’s exhaustingly long for me. I still have an average of fifty years to go if I don’t try to interfere with it and I stay healthy, physically. How can I keep doing this? Everyday is so different inside of my head, but nothing changes out there.",
1048,I didn’t ask to be born I am suffering to much,Ive been depressed my whole life and it has been nothing but suffering and I didn’t ask to be born and now I’m forced to go to school and get a career and survive when I didn’t ask to be born
1049,I made a plan,"Last night I did some self-harm. I had been able to resist that urge for the past 6 years. Today I still feel the urge. I was drinking my morning coffee and I had a daydream of killing myself. It was gruesome.

I’m in therapy, it doesn’t really help, even though I’m being honest with her. 

I’m doing fine in university, it’s just taking longer than expected.

I go to the gym, I don’t use drugs, I have friends.

In spite of this, I feel hopeless.

Climate change is going to destroy the planet. Humans aren’t working to end it in any meaningful way. I’m not sure I want to be around to see everything fall apart.

My family isn’t supportive. They don’t respect my pronouns, they don’t acknowledge how autism affects me, they regularly put me down. It’s all around unhealthy but I can’t afford to move out. If I could I would.

I haven’t written a note, I haven’t set a date, I’m not giving away possessions. But I’m closer than I’ve ever been to attempting suicide.

I’m still debating, but the plan is coming to fruition.

Please. Help."
1050,My life depended on a single test.,"3/30.
I failed, miserably. The other test, I came in first place. They didn't give me a chance.

I want to die, more than anything in the world. I'm a failure. I have nowhere to go, nowhere to study. My life ended today."
1051,After committing suicide.,"If you believe in an afterlife, what do you think happens next? Will we be punished? I have read many NDEs and I am really curious. I wish I could assure myself that it will be ok. I know my family will be okay without me. Just need to know that after will be ok, and that the 9mm to the grapefruit wont hurt.."
1052,"What’s more fucked up to do to my son and his mom (my gf), kill myself in a way they could find me or in a way that they would never find out and always wonder if I just ran out on them?",
1053,5 more days...I got this :),
1054,hopefully tonight is the night,"i can’t stop crying all the time, it’s constant pain. i hate to say it but i almost feel like it’s selfish of my family and friends to want me to stay alive for their happiness, when i’m suffering like this. i’m barely able to take care of myself and i’ve already fucked my life up beyond repair. my plan is to take a whole bottle of benadryl then slit my wrists just for good measure and drift off to sleep."
1055,I’m 15 and my life is already over,"My anxiety is out of control, has lead me to feel violent, suicidal and depressed. I’m often terrified of being alone at night out of fear of being attacked. I often feel useless and have phases of starving myself because looking in the mirror makes me feel, fat, disgusting and anxious. I never take myself seriously and end up dancing around my room while self harming and preparing to end my life. I try to distract myself but it never works. I REALLY WANT TO DIE. There’s no point being alive. PEOPLE DONT SEE HOW IM FEELING. i used a facade but nobody knows how i really feel which frustrates me further. I don’t think i can take it anymore."
1056,I can’t do it anymore,"My wife said she’s gonna leave me, I work at a job that pays well enough (so I can’t just quit and still pay the bills) but stresses me out and makes my life hell, I have no real friends where I live at now. I can’t keep forcing myself to try and find some sort of bullshit purpose. Ever since I was a kid I was bullied and made to feel bad about myself, so I’ve struggled with not wanting to be who I am for most of my life. I’m tired of fighting, I just want to drive into a tree and be done with my bullshit once and for all. I think I’m actually going to do it this time."
1057,A Friend called me out,"Friday night, while I was out having some beers, a Friend called me out On ny depression, and said how it has effected him and other of My Friends, that I am not get ting better, but seeming like more of an asshole.. I have felt Up until now, that I have grotten better, I have even started writing My master thesis again.. But this have made me hit rock bottom again - I am not angry at him, I can't be better before I know what I do wrong.. But I am at a point again, where I am thinking about suicide, since I bother my friends.. This is the first time in more than half a year I have thought about suicide.."
1058,When I think of all the times....,"...I planned to kill myself and didn't...all the additional painful experiences and disappointment I could have spared myself....🤦🤦
At least it's not too late."
1059,I hope i'll do it tomorrow,"I don't wanna run away anymore, and say that i'll do it another day. It's been too long. I've been training too much. Told too much that i'll do it but never did. I hope i'll do it tomorrow. And that i won't fail."
1060,Thinking about killing myself,"I sometimes get this thing in my head where, just for a fraction of a second, I can see a world where I am happy and comfortable and enjoying myself. So many times I’ve tried to find a way to get to that place or stay in that mindset, stay in the calmness I feel when I see that happy place. It can’t be done though, that place doesn’t exist in the real world, or maybe it does but I can’t see it because I’m trapped in my mind, blinded by depression. I’ve given up trying to find the happiness.

I was making porridge the other day and my mother was talking to me, I can’t remember what she was saying. But then she said something about how phones are the reason millennials are all depressed and if they just went outside and got some fresh air and ran around they would be fine. I told her that I could run around outside for hours everyday and it wouldn’t make a dent in my depression. Now she knows I have depression, I’ve actually been diagnosed and I’m on medication, and she knows I’m suicidal because she found my suicide note one day when she was snooping through my bag, but she still said to me “are you seriously still claiming to be depressed?”. She’s a bitch.

I’m an artist, making art has always been the thing I was best at, people always knew me as the artist since I was a little kid. I do want to make art, I’d like to become a successful artist and do it as a career. Well.. I mean I don’t actually WANT to do it, it would just be a lot better for me than any other kind of job. But I can’t make art anymore, I quit for a long long time but started doing it again a little while after going on meds. I just can’t draw anymore, I don’t like looking at my art, I don’t like looking at other people’s art, I don’t like making art.

I sometimes just stop in the middle of doing something and stay completely still, I completely space out and forget where I am. I usually sing the same verse of a song over and over in my head. I get stuck there. It’s hard to move. I think to myself “why am I just standing here like a statue?” But I can’t move, I think about moving and then I think about how there is no point in moving because I will feel the same wether I move or not, so I may as well stay here. And I do stay there.

I bang my head in the wall, I put my eyeball as close to a bright lamp-bulb as a can to blind myself temporarily, I pull my hair, I slap myself. I feel empty no matter what I do. I think I’m just trying to do every single thing I can possibly think of (including this) to try and fix myself or something, I’m not actually sure what I’m trying to achieve. 

I hate my mother. I want her to be happy and I wish she had a perfect life and had everything she ever wanted. But she isn’t happy, I think she’s pretty miserable, and she has a LOT of anger. That anger gets taken out on anyone who goes near her, but mostly me and my dad. I feel so sorry for my dad, he’s married to an insanely toxic person and he’s so nice. He doesn’t do anything wrong but my mother is constantly arguing with him and giving out to him about the stupidest things. She such a crazy bitch. My dad is the only thing keeping me alive, I know he cares about me and I know I can talk to him about anything, literally anything without any judgement. I love him a lot and I don’t want to make him sad by killing his daughter but he already seems to be sad so it’s not like I’ll be ruining a perfect life. 

Committing suicide is a really really really hard thing to do. No matter how much you want to die and no matter how much you hate your life it’s still so difficult to end it. It’s really terrifying, there’s no way to do it without being terrified, you just have to push through the fear. Hopefully when I turn eighteen and am able to buy liquor it will be easier, although I have tried to kill myself while drunk before and as you can see, I pussied out. When I’m eighteen though, I’ll be able to get as drunk as I want so hopefully being more drunk will make it easier. 
Or maybe I’ll find the balls to rip that bandaid off tonight."
1062,Nothing’s even wrong,"But if I had a gun it would be long over. I honestly feel fine and there’s nothing that’s actually going on, but I just wanna leave it off here ya’know? I live with my parents and I’ve been told my father keeps a gun somewhere for like defense and normal stuff but I’ve been looking for it and I can’t find it. I’ve tried convincing myself that I do want to live but i just really really don’t. I don’t think i want to be helped."
1063,i don’t want to die,"but nothing feels real

my vision feels like it’s fuzzy around th e edges

i want to throw up it’s like i’m living a constant nightmare in a horror film 

i don’t have much choice"
1064,If I can't get a job by the time I turn 21 I'm going to kill myself,"Since my previous post, I've concluded in that short time that my life is in fact a dead end. I've decided that this is the best option, rather than being stuck in a dead end job search for the rest of my life with no friends or any emotional fulfillment, it'd be better if I killed myself. I don't think it's possible for me to be happy in a world like this anyway, but at least with a job I'd have money and something to do. I'm so worthless not even fast food positions want to hire me, instead those positions are all filled with high schoolers and college students who have somehow managed to break the ""no experience but need experience to be hired"" paradox and get hired somehow.

If I turn 21 without ever having had a single job I will kill myself, that's truly the mark of a failure and I can't take feeling worthless any longer."
1065,Help,I have attempted to kill myself twice both of which have failed
1066,useless,"nobody would care if i died, would they? i don't blame them. i was never an important enough part of their lives. they ignore me until they want something from me, they pretend to care when they would rather have me gone. it's so shitty to care so much about everyone around you and not receive anything in return. death sounds like a better option than living so alone right now."
1067,i deserve nothing in life,"13/M 
im selfish, annoying, stupid, ugly, worthless, useless, unloved, cutting makes me feel something but otherwise i dont feel fucking anything, i constantly think about killing myself and even tried hanging myself a few times, made a noose 4 days ago and my little sister almost walked in on me and i threw it under my bed, no one knows im gay and judging by how much people around me think homosexuality is disgusting im not gonna come out any time soon, everyone around me hates me, i just wanna cry my heart out in someones arms, i just wanna be comforted and told its gonna be fine ;("
1068,Im a 13 yr old male and i chose my expiration date,"Im a really stupid person and i did some unspeakable thing in only thirteen years i feel so hopeless and depressed. I have only about three friends and i dont think they are even my real friends but i'd rather not talk about that i got a couple of things i want to get off my chest i really hope this doesn't go viral. when i was 7 i raped my 6 year old sister i know she knows but we act like it never happened i think she just want to have a regular life but i feel like things be way better if would've never been born .when i was 9 i nearly killed myself but my mom called an ambulance and saved me i stabbed my self in the stomach and passed out my sister found me and screamed thats when my mom came in and call an ambulance. at the age of 11 i hit someone with a text book and got sent to an alternative school(we dont stay the night there) i took a knife to school one of my ""friends""at the time told on me and i got in trouble .at 12 i started to get these hallucinations i thought i had gotten a girl pregnant in my head she had an abortion and that still has me depressed i know its fake but why does it feel so real. when i first turned 13 had a sleepover at my house and one of my friends wanted to touch my sister in the rapey way so i went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife i nearly stabbed him but my mom grabbed me and slapped me. after that  i lost control i wanyed to die so badly. i made up my mind im killing my self on cristmas eve i got it planned out because i know that nobody will be awake during that night so i will slit my wrist i cut myself before so im guessing it wont hurt im just sorry to my mom and sister"
1069,Last wishes before I die,"Bio:
20 y/o just starting Bachelors of Cybersecurity.
Terrible at maths and coding. I mean a pure 0.
On a scholarship, living on a very lucky undeserved stipend.
No gf, not even any friends, people talk with me just out of pity.
Going to die boring, alone, useless, and absolutely unliked by even my parents.
Not much I can really do about it. I have tried, yet just ended up confused trying to improve myself. Could be considered a typical incel, however I have nobody to blame, and deserve to die. So before I die, I am going to make as much donations and good deeds. So please, kind community of reddit, please send me some nice nudes before I commit suicide, because I am that much of a fucking retard :)"
1070,I don't know if this is even valid.,"I've attempted suicide yesterday, at least I tried to kill myself despite knowing that my fatigue won't let me. And now I'm thinking about it and feeling pretty bad. I don't understand why do I need help, I don't understand how could I get it, I don't understand how can someone actually help and not just pressure me and get me in trouble for seeking for help.

I wish to talk to anyone, I just wish someone to explain why am I even valid, I genuinely can't understand. And since I had only one legit attempt, I'm feeling like I don't deserve help, but I'm a faker if I'm asking for help. I don't have friends to talk to and I'd rather die than talk to my parents about my troubles, so here I am, desperately asking for a talk, not even knowing if I may ask for it here.

I'm sorry for posting this. I wouldn't be surprised if this post would get taken down or if I'd get completely banned from this subreddit. But I don't care. I don't care about a lot anymore. Again, I'm sorry. Have a nice day."
1071,1 month,"i can't take it anymore. everything hurts, i just want it to stop. i see no other way.
it's all because i'm so pathetic. i'm just weird and worthless, i don't even deserve to be alive.
in one month i will hang myself. the only reason i'm not doing it right now is because i don't know how to and also because i'm a fucking coward. i want it to work so fucking bad, but i'm scared i'll screw it up. i don't know what will happen if i don't succeed. 
i'm not even scared of death. i've never been a spiritual person and i'm pretty much certain death is just death, nothing unknown, just your body shutting off and your mind finally ceasing to exist. 
let's just hope i die quick and it doesn't hurt too much."
1072,there's nothing here for me,"i'm a mess, i'm a fucking wreck, only things keeping me around were bands and my best friend.  i constantly have depressive episodes and my manic ones don't last long enough to keep me sustained.

i ignore my friends a shit load, because people drain the everloving fuck out of me. that's what i've been doing the past week, now that he and i are '''talking''' it seems awkward and weird. i hate this, i hate this. i won't respond to my other friend either because i constantly feel like i'm bringing him down.

i'm a ghastly human being, no wonder my ''''best friend'''' moved on and found someone better, someone who got him and someone who understands him, I harbor no ill will in him for that.

i'm unmotivated, i'm failing all my course work, the only one i'm doing decent at is history, mostly because i either write the essays whilst manic or i plagarize the whole thing, i feel guilt when my teacher praises me for them because i did not write them.

i give up on everything, on the fanfics i write, on the languages i am trying to learn, on bass on fucking everything.

i'm alone in this world, i don't need anyone but misery needs company. i'm pathetic, i find no comfort in anything, not even fucking green day who were like a comfort blanket to me.

all i do is piss off and anger my parent, i piss off and anger my friends, i piss off and anger my teachers, i piss off and anger everyone because i'm a gnarly person. i'm a gnarly fucking dude who doesn't even get a thrill from slitting his skin open anymore, i'm void of all emotions, i'm just a pathetic numb void and i deserve death, i crave death, i vibe at cemeteries and look for graves that have 'Mark' carved into them because i'm imagining what my grave will be like.

i don't wanna be here, i don't wanna be there, i don't wanna be anywhere, i just wanna get get out get out get out get out get out get out get out of here. i wanna be gone, i hate this, i fucking hate this, everyone says i'm too young to die, i dont care, there is no future for me. ive got no future, my only future interests are decomposing in the ground, rotting away, mouldering away, unconcious of this godawful existence, of this godawful universe. fuck this fuck this fuck this fuck this shit"
1073,i’m tired,"i’m so tired of living, of breathing, of the constant pain and mood switches. i’m so close to giving up, it’s a month today since the last time i was going to do it. every time i go to do it, i freeze, i can’t make myself do it. i don’t think i want to die, i just can’t bear to live like this for much longer"
1074,Existence is suffering,"I say that a lot. Existence is suffering.

To suffer there needs to be someone who can suffer. As long as I exist I am at constant risk of future suffering. People alwayd insist that it will inevitably get better, but my behaviour is never going to allow that to happen, it's all downhil just as it's been for the last five years.

As long as I exist I will continue to suffer. If I don't exist I can't suffer. Dying will fix literally all of my problems. There isn't a single thing that dying wouldn't resolve. I don't care about how my parents will feel. I don't care about the potential that I'd just waste anyway. I don't care about all the stuff I'd miss out on cause none of it would be enjoyable to make me glad I didn't kill myself.

As long as I live I suffer. The dead do not suffer. I'm better off dead than alive."
1075,Tried to commit suicide at eleven years old thinking about doin it still,So when I was eleven years old my parents went through a divorce and I didn’t take it very well. I’ve always known that my parents didn’t make a lot of money and usually after two weeks into every month we would almost be out of money. I was livin with my grandparents most of the time and visited my mom now and then. My dad was always really strict and mad at me or my brother and when mom left him he became really depressed. When I saw everyone who was close to me didn’t feel well I developed depression and then I felt like I just couldn’t take  it anymore. I attached a rope to the ceiling and tried to hang myself but a part of ceiling fell off and instead of ending it with a knife I just fell asleep. Since then I’ve been thinking about it almost everyday for two years. I just don’t know what to do.
1076,I am barely even living,What difference does it make if I die.
1077,Mania Brings Back Old Feelings,"in general i’ve been feeling a lot better and been happier consistently in the past few years. however my anxiety was so bad i had awful paranoia and temporary acute psychosis. i’ve been feelings fine recently, starting to really feel happy for the first time in my life. but i had a manic happy episode for a few days and then crashed and now i’ve been at a bit of a low and yesterday i really considered getting addicted to adderall again. i would buy it until i couldn’t afford it and then kill myself. i wouldn’t even consider myself suicidal or at risk of suicide or self harm at all right now. just crazy what mania does to my brain and thought process. it just seemed so rational to be an addict. sometimes it still feels easier to be and addict rather than a recovered/recovering addict. but i want to stay clean. feels better being clean. feels so much better being clean."
1078,Just existing,"It's weird, I do things I enjoy, like read, play video games, sew and sometimes even exercise. I'll have somewhat of a nice time doing these things. However, I still feel miserable to a great extent, no matter what. I guess I am just so unsatisfied with life.

No strong friendships. A bitter hatred for myself. Exhausted in every way constantly. Feeling like I'm just wasting my therapist's time. A longing to self harm always, and relapsing every now and then.

Why? Why do I have to live this way? An entire group of people have stopped talking to me, I ruined all my closest friendships, I'm constantly feeling miserable. I see new friendships forming, but I feel as if I'm not strong enough to pursue them to a point where I'm actually close with anyone.

And that's what I want so bad. To have a best friend, a close friend. To have my close friends back. I'd kill to have these people back in my life (not really lol). But it's too late. I'm a horrible person."
1079,I'm Worthless,"I'm 14M, my dad is a pussy, my mom is abusive and screams at me for ""taking his [my dad's]side"" whenever I try to stop her. At school I barely have friends and those that I do don't really like me they're just trying to be nice.

I am so hopelessly ugly that it's 100% guaranteed I will never have a girlfriend. This Is not a body image issue, it's just a issue of my bad face. And I'm a guy. I'm 5'8"" and not growing anymore too, just to make things worse.

I've never done anything at all with my life, just simpering to my abusive mom who will just take my phone for ever disagreeing with her. I am never happy anymore at all. Just more misery every day.

I also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome which means extreme cramping every single day of my life and complete dependence on having a toilet nearby.

My parents forced me into isolation by homeschooling me until this year (9th grade). Which means I have zero social skills. I don't even have the building blocks for social skills. I've never been to a party or even gone to anyone else's house, until this year at 14 I had never even talked to another person under 18. 

I wasn't even allowed to play games as a kid, I was forced to do extreme academic work and do nothing but school and sleep. My parents were both extreme nerds with 130 IQs, neither of who wanted me, my mom just had me to spare her 9 months of endometriosis pain (she admits this is why she had me). 

I just don't care any more, my 15th birthday is Friday which means I can spend it alone in my room like any other day, after a miserable day of final exams on my birthday. Final exams that will result in punishment if I don't get A+, in my family I'm told I'm an idiot who needs tutoring if I get an A not an A+. B's are grounds for punishment. No, I'm not Asian.

I just wish I had someone to be with or something to do, all I do is make people uncomfortable. Some people are nice to me but only out of obligation and kindness, not because they actually like me.

Nothing will change when I get older. I'll still be disgusting and will die a virgin, if I get to be 18 I'll just be an i*cel. 

And even if I get a good job or have any academic success, it's all pointless, nobody likes me and I enjoy absolutely nothing. 

I want to die, a lot. But I'm also afraid that there's no afterlife and it's going to be a black void. That's as much a possibility as heaven or hell. I really don't want to be lonely for all eternity."
1080,Help,The hours tick by so slowly. I feel so empty. I want to sleep but my mind races with 1000 different thoughts at once. I cant turn it off. I just want to leave this earth. I want to die.
1081,I want to stop,"I keep saying that but i never seem to fo anything. I dont understand why. Maybe im too used to pain. Maybe im too used to numbness.

I want to die so much. I want to escape. But at the same time so much inside me ks screaming to hold on.

I know its frustrating for my partner. But i dont know what to do anymore. I want to stop being depressed but its all i know how to do.

Sometimes i wonder if im better off dead so i dont have to deal with this. No one has to deal with me.

I want to stop.

I want to stop hurting."
1082,I’m so tired,I just don’t want to suffer anymore. I can’t take the rollercoaster. I feel like everyone hates me. I hate myself too. My boyfriend won’t speak to me and we live in the same house. My parents are about to move away with their new baby. I have no availability for therapy with my work hours. I feel so alone and hopeless all the time. I feel like i’m screaming behind a glass box and no one will fucking listen. Everything just hurts. Every day for years and i’m just so incredibly exhausted. I don’t believe it will get better and I just want to feel at peace.
1083,im scared,i feel like i made the biggest mistake in my life and i cant change it. i feel stuck in one place. im alone again after i tried so hard but even though im so tired of it i need to try again so i wont be a burden for others. i just make myself and others sad and i want that to stop but it never seems to. i want time to stop and never start again.

1085,Anyone fancy killing themselves with me?,I really dont want to go alone
1086,Help,"I feel completely alone. Im 19 and a female. I've a history of attempted suicide. Im in college. My parents don't have the energy to help me anymore. Not only can I no longer go to them for help, I've to put on my best smile for them to stop things from getting wore. Things are extremely stressful at home and I'm absorbing it all. My sisters away having her own crisis so I cant go to her. I'm not exaggerating when I say I don't have any friends.

I'd like to commit myself to a hospital but my parents would never allow it.

please help"
1087,I hate society,"F(17) my girlfriend almost broke up with me because she was scared that somebody would hire a hit man to kill us when we were older, and she said that she wanted to be straight, despite her openly saying she\`s never felt attraction guys. i managed to calm her down and she said she felt safer, but that\`s only one of my issues. my parents overreact at everything i do (specifically my mother) for example if i dropped my food they\`d scream my name as if i killed somebody in front of them and my dad wastes my family\`s money on beer and gets drunk, he\`s also mentally abusive. i have no clue on what i should do, i\`m planning on killing myself though."

I do want someone to talk to but don’t know where else to turn

1090,I want to give up,"I'm a burden to literally everyone in my life. Everyone would be better off without me. 

My mental health is fucked. It always has been. It's so fucking tiring struggling through every single day and making progress little by little just to fucking break down again. 

I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm ashamed. I hate myself. I wish I wasn't here to witness how much of a fuck up I am and see everyone around me either trying to help me at their detriment or hating me. 

Last time I almost killed myself was 6 years ago, and I didn't because I lived alone and my cat needed me. 

Tonight I know my cat lives with me and my boyfriend, and both of them probably prefer each others company to mine. 

No one needs me. No one's life is improved by me being in it. 

After 6 years I have self harmed tonight. I want to end it. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm such a shitty person I'm not worth it."
1091,"Scorned by psychiatry: I know meds have helped some of you, but they’re the bane of my existence the last couple years.","This is more of a venting to people who will listen...I'll probably delete the post but just had to share my hurt.

TL:DR Currently, and have been going through neurochemical hell caused by psych meds. Feels never ending. I saw the light at the end of the tunnel many times this year (in a good way) but there's a cave in and the light disappears once in a while and I can't take it anymore. But I continue to drudge on and fight the good fight, I just seriously don't know how much longer I can keep it up. When it gets like this I seem to be able to take it a day at a time, but I feel nearer to the edge once again. 

I typed the following this morning but since then pretty sure I sprained my pinky punching the wall out of self hate/pity/loathing. 

\----------------------

I went to get help, I thought I was doing what was right. 4 years later it’s the biggest regret of my life.

Went to a psychiatrist for all of an hour, he threw me on Zoloft and Klonopin...yes they ‘worked’ but I didn’t know to what detriment. Turns out there’s no such thing as a free lunch in psychiatry. A year down the line I start having cognitive issues...same psych: ‘I can’t believe I didn’t notice it before, you’ve got adhd’. Yet another pharmaceutical double edged sword. Yeah it helped me feel more social, under the illusion I was breaking down barriers, but it was all amphetamine produced. Soon enough I was just another amphetamine addicted grad student, *convinced* this was the key to my success, and as long as I could keep that stimulation going all was right with the world.

My small business venture after college, now two years in, was about to see some real success, if I was able to keep my shit together. But that’s the thing, I began to struggle more and more. My memory had become immensely fogged. Suicidal ideation became the norm. Continuing relying on the little pink pills to get my ideas going, and execution flowing, things began to get more confusing. My execution plateaued and I began to struggle putting thoughts together.

I went to see another psychiatrist as my original one was leaving the state (ironic that I was about to have a mental breakdown at his hands). This one saw I was on Klonopin and claimed I should take more. I laughed in her face as I was finally beginning to understand the over reliance docs have with medication. I continued on to a local university hospital’s inpatient program where I was at the hand of a newbie resident psychiatrist. This is where the real fun began.

After a couple meetings with this new psych, she decided in her infinite wisdom that I should jump off the Dexedrine and the Klonopin at the same time. She gave me no heads up for the insanity that would follow, nor any guidelines on how I should taper. This wound up being my ultimate downfall as I basically went through a rapid taper off both Klonopin and Dexedrine. This was September 2018.

I then went through about 6 months of absolutely blasted short term and long term memory, intense ptsd, the lowest depressive periods of my life (thusfar), akathesia, inability to think. The works. All while the psychiatrist had the gall to skeptically doubt my suffering as she believed I shouldn’t have more than a couple weeks of withdrawal. So she threw me on the highest dose of Zoloft at 200mg. More numbing- which also backfired as I couldn’t process my emotion, ending up in even greater suicidal ideation.

Through it all I never actually made any ‘attempts’, only the idea and urge would rear its ugly head on a daily basis for months, and now years.

After the hell that was acute withdrawal and subsequent post acute withdrawal syndrome, at about the 7 month mark I began to see progress as I was working out way more and learning mindfulness/meditation. My business still was at a hard stop but I began to think around the hell that I had experienced.

Through it all I wasn’t entirely convinced of Dexedrine’s evil side as I perceived it to have more pros than cons. I tried it a couple times in withdrawal (hindsight this was a big mistake) and found all of a sudden all my issues were resolved. ‘Hmm maybe I do have adhd’ my still amphetamine dependent mind would say. Around summer 2019 I decided to say goodbye to the newbie psych who put me through hell and just have my GP prescribe Zoloft and Dexedrine.

I was once more on my high horse, riding the ego boosting properties of amphetamine and thought maybe I’ll be alright. I was still working my way off Zoloft in the meantime (this time extremely slow taper) and figured 5mg of Dexedrine XR wouldn’t hurt. I got a job at the same time while keeping my business on the side, keeping busy helped even more reacclimating myself back into society after 6 months of isolation in withdrawal.

Now 6 months later, I began to see the harm Dexedrine was wreaking this whole time, and it’s not unlike Klonopin how the cons are illusive. I’ve decided to cold turkey the Dexedrine once more and this time permanently. I’ve realized I’ve been lying to myself about this drug...just like the others.

Now I’m around the corner from 26, about to leave my only job since college (a shitty local IT position), a failed business, soon to be no health insurance, basically 100k in debt with two degrees that don’t seem to yield very much, years of social trauma (pre psychiatry) and psychological trauma (post psychiatry). I feel as though I’ve spent the last year and a half in various withdrawal states, each with their own levels of extreme cognitive dysfunction.

If I wasn’t already mentally ill, psychiatry sure made it the case that I would be after these meds. I *really* wish that first psychiatrist just told me to meditate and exercise before throwing me on these pills that would do nothing more than negatively alter the trajectory of my post-college life, leaving me more in depression, despair and disconnection than I ever was in the first place.

This venting session is a culmination of my feelings mostly prompted by my withdrawal induced hate for the state of psychopharmacology. I always find myself in an even better headspace when I’m removed from adjusting the dosages of meds, but the longer this goes on, the more I realize how toxic these meds can be for some."
1092,I don't know how much fight I have left in me,"I lost my best friend and love of my life, I'm in debt, I feel like a failure all the time. And I had to put my dog down last night suddenly."
1093,I want it all to finally end,"Today I woke up wondering how many pills it would take or if a razor would really hurt that bad. Recently I confided in my only friend and she made me realize my family’s treatment and my outlook towards me is not normal. 

My birthday just passed and everyone except her forgot it even though I’ve been talking about it for weeks. My other “friends” didn’t even make an effort to even TRY and come see me or go out to eat. I had to remind my family. 

My mom constantly complains about having to support me financially in any way and does not support me emotionally at all. Every time I’ve been vulnerable around her she tells me to get over. I woke up at 6, went to school, finished at 4, went to work at 5,  got off at 11, and finished my hw around 1. Yet she still made me clean the bathroom and kitchen while my brother played video games and my older sister napped. 

My older sister hates doing anything for me at all. She’s not even willing to spare $2 on me when she works full time. She was mad when she had to pick me up from school once even though she wasn’t doing anything else. Literally anything that has to do with me inconveniences her. She is the most selfish person I’ve ever met. 

My cousin and aunt constantly use and manipulate me. I made an entire post of it if anyone is interested. 

I can’t get out of this situation because I have no money. I cant get a job because I have no way of getting there. I have no one to take me, no car, and Uber would take my entire check. I can’t work online either. All I need is enough for a car, but no way of getting it. I’m only 17, so if I did get a job I’d  have to work minimum wage. Therefore it’d take me weeks to get enough.

I was talking to my friend about how I have no desire to see my life past 30. I can’t even imagine it. Now I have no desire to live past 20. Sometimes I find myself wishing for a terminal disease. I just want it all to end even if I have to end it myself."
1094,I don't want to be here,"I'm a burden to literally everyone in my life. Everyone would be better off without me. 

My mental health is fucked. It always has been. It's so fucking tiring struggling through every single day and making progress little by little just to fucking break down again. 

I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm ashamed. I hate myself. I wish I wasn't here to witness how much of a fuck up I am and see everyone around me either trying to help me at their detriment or hating me. 

Last time I almost killed myself was 6 years ago, and I didn't because I lived alone and my cat needed me. 

Tonight I know my cat lives with me and my boyfriend, and both of them probably prefer each others company to mine. 

No one needs me. No one's life is improved by me being in it. 

After 6 years I have self harmed tonight. I want to end it. I don't want to do this anymore"
1095,Goodbye,"I’m officially at a place where I can let go. I don’t know if it will kill me, but I can’t live with myself if I don’t try. Sometime between now and tonight I will drown myself in pills. I don’t want to die, but I can’t stop the pain. 

I should be strong. I should keep moving. But for once I can’t. I feel stuck and alone. Nothing is going right for me. And life isn’t going to get any better. I’m sorry. 

If the pills don’t work I’ll know it was a sign to stay here. Maybe this earth has something for me. But if I die then I know I made the right choice. No more pain. 

I’m 21, living alone and finally am going to feel the peace I’ve been dreaming of. 

I’m sitting here with the pills in my hand. I don’t want to. I have to."
1096,I fucked up,I relapsed recently and started using again. I can't bear the guilt that I feel. I also just found out that I missed my rent and they are evicting me. I tried talking to them. I have the money but they won't take it now. I am such a fuck up. Too bad that they will have to evict my corpse as well. Not gonna be my problem for too much longer.
1097,I dream about what it would be like if I suicide,"I’ve been thinking about it lately. I wonder what my family would say, what my friends and everyone around me would say. Most of them think I’m happy and all the positive stuff so I bet it would be good things but I’m actually just filed with negative emotions and thoughts"
1098,I'm so tired,"I live a really fortunate and lovely life but somehow I can't shake this voice in my head that's just constantly telling me to end it all. I won't do it, not right now, because all I can think about is how it would affect some of the people in my life really badly. I don't want anyone to hurt because of me. But because of that I feel like I'm just living for their sake and I'm honestly just really tired."
1099,Suicide mission,"I think I will quit everything here and fly straight to Asia, find a girl, impregnate her, and then kill myself. kind of like a suicide mission. I dont see the point in living anywhere by myself with no perspective. I dont see the point in life anymore. I guess I have to continue writing suicide letters. I feel like I'm blowing up my life, but I'm not actually, cos I don't have a life worth living for. And I am scared of traveling far away and cutting all ties, but at the same time, I dont see any other way. I always knew that eventually my life would be ruined, I would end up in a deadend and suicide would be inevitable. I am so incredibly lonely and disconnected from the world. I have absolutely no one left to talk to. I am 30 now. Nobody cares anymore. I know it's the right thing to do, in my case. everybody dies. My time is imminent. It's all coming to a close. I can't take it anymore and there is no hope for improvement. I will always be depressed. I will never be able to keep a job. I don't want to live in shame and be on the dole. But more than anything, I don't want to be lonely and miserable anymore. I mean, what's wrong with one last try right? I have a bit of money to burn before I go down.

I dont know how I can kill myself. I am so scared of it. I don't wanna die a slow death of homelessness, malnutrition and drug abuse. I want it clean."
1100,Self worth,"Over a rough past year I have now realized everything is about assigned worth. Is this worth that. Is working worth the pay? Is cooking worth the food? And it's made me think is life worth the pain and trials? I haven't found any reason in the past year. It has been incredibly emotionally taxing and it has me at my lowest I've ever been. Through a break up, a loss of family, and a failure to find the love of God I feel that there isn't worth anymore. The pain is no longer worth the living."
1101,Give me a reason not to kill myself,"I am 39, I have no job, no money, at the end of the month no place to live, no family to take me in, no car, no friends, and no hope for anything to get better. My life is just fucked."
1102,The good thing about living alone,"I can actually end my life without anyone noticing. Is not like they will notice anyway. I had a crisis today, neither my sister nor my mother paid me attention, I just need reassurance, they wouldn't even give me that. I think I'm a burden and I'll wait to get my new apartment and I will end it all."
1103,Planning on killing myself,"I wrote a cringey suicide note, I'm gonna shoot myself in a shooting range, my life sucks on all ways, and I'm failing at everything, I don't think it's gonna matter that much, I think I have the balls to do it this time."
1104,Life is shit and I don't have people to talk to.,"I lost a lot of friends this year. I only have spoken to a few this week, felt like an eternity. Like going to r slash Needafriend was nice and all for someone to talk to for a couple hours, and then they all leave. I don't have much of a family to talk to, to them my mental health is the last thing. All they care about is my grades like I'm some sort of immortal being. I really want to just be gone, but then when I tell someone I want to leave they all go “don't do this people care about you, your family cares”.. no one cares, no one wants me and no one needs me. I'm useless. No one would notice I would be gone. Probably could go for months without people noticing. Please help, I really need to talk to someone before fuck everything up with another suicide attempt"
1105,Sex/porn addiction,"I'm 23 years old and restarting my whole life and finally going back to college. Used to be addicted to Adderall and alcohol but I'm clean now, I smoke the occasional joint though. 

I've came to realize how much I need sex. I've been single for 8months and all I've been doing is masturbating 3-4 times a day and paying for escorts whenever I can. I've put myself into 6k of credit card debt, i live at home and have to hide my debt and addiction from my family.

 When my hypomania episodes kick in (I'm bipolar type 2), I go into overdrive. I make about 1000 a month and put $300 towards my credit card and bills, $200 for therapy and then the rest for escorts (also get more money from credit card cash advances and/or selling stuff I own). Sometimes I'll skip therapy just to have more money for escorts. I hate myself, I always tell myself this is it, I'm not paying for sex anymore. 

When I abstain from escorts I basically hide in my room and masturbate all day. I don't have any friends because I neglected them, I just want to have sex. I haven't had sex with someone who wasn't a sex worker since I was in my last relationship. 

If I go a week or so without sex I lose it. I can't do anything, everything puts me into a fit of rage. I need sex, I need it often and it's always on my mind. I look at porn almost all day, in public, on the bus, doesn't matter.

 I hate myself and I can't live like this anymore. I have so much shame but I just can't fucking stop. What's wrong with me? When I'm on my way to see an escort I just feel AWFUL, but I know I'll feel worse if I don't.  This has taken over my life. It is who I am now and I can't live like this anymore. I don't want to keep going through this.

I don't know what to do, the only solution I see is death."
1106,Scared of suicide,"Is anyone here scared? I have motivation to keep living but feeling undeserving of live and happiness?

My girlfriend has turned my life upside down for the better. She's so perfect and kind and sweet and makes me feel appreciated and loved but I don't deserve her. I'm trash!"
1107,"I'm feeling a bizarre peace. Hard to explain, but I could quietly kill myself now.","Just die, die in peace, without remorse, without despair. It's as if I've accepted that things have no way for me. As hard as I try, they will never be the way I want. So ... I was able to accept, and I'm very happy, for the first time in all these years I was able to accept that there is no way and I need to die. I'm feeling fulfilled and at peace, I just need to kill myself finally, finally be free. I have sought this freedom for many years, all my life. I'll finally be free, I'm feeling so alive now"
1108,hospitalization,hey does anyone know what conditions you have to have to be hospitalized by will in a psychatric wing? I’m sort of getting lots of suicidal thoughts but I always seem like I’m overreacting. I’m 16 and living in Québec if that helps anything.
1109,I need help now just someone to talk to,211 is bullshit scripted garbage
1110,How much bleach does it take?,"There’s no place for a worthless rodent like me. I’m not asking for help staying alive, I’m looking for help dying. I want to make sure I can’t be revived &amp; have 0 chance of survival. My plan is to shoot up as much heroin as my last $30 can buy, chase it with bleach, then jump off the local 165’ bridge. Should that be enough? I know the fatal fall height is closer to 200 feet but I don’t have any taller bridges around me. I’d love to pay for help making this happen, but again I’m a worthless rodent &amp; you’re better off taping a banana to a wall if you want money, it’ll be worth a lot more than I am."
1111,Suffering in silence,I cannot talk to mum about any of my emotional stuff and its killing me. She knows I have anxiety but not depression or suicidal thoughts. I've hidden this from her my whole life but honestly I dont really know why. It's gotten so bad I cant even tell her I have a girlfriend. No matter how hard I try I just choke whenever I try and talk to her. I hate myself for it. I'm seriously so tired of having to lie to her. Any advice people? Thanks
1112,PLEASE HELP ME,Why won’t anyone help me???? I can’t stop crying
1113,I tried to give him his Christmas gifts because I know he is leaving me.,"I tried to give my boyfriend/fiance his Christmas gifts, because after my outbursts the other night, he has not wanted to speak to me. I asked him if he wanted a hug, he said no. He said I am the last person he wants to speak with at this point.

I said ""I need to know what is going on, are you leaving me?"" He told me to sit with the discomfort of uncertainty and to deal with it. He isn't telling me if he is leaving or not, but I know he is. 

I tried to give him the gifts I bought him for Christmas and he didn't want them. 

I am so fucked in the head. Nothing I do makes me change. Weeks of bliss go by and then I fuck up again and again. 

I'm tired of being alive. I have been happy lately, but I can't take the joy being crushed and taken away from me every time bad things inevitably happen again.

I really don't know why I'm even posting this. Life isn't worth living without him. We are long time soul mates. We are each other's best friend. Anyone who says I'll move on is full of shit."
1114,I’ve been told that the bullying I get for being a furry is a dumb reason to be suicidal. Is it?,"One of the main causes of my depression and light, but present suicidal thoughts is because I’ve frequently been getting bullied for being a furry. It’s online for the most part now, but it used to pop up in real life back when I was in school. Whenever I try to vent to someone, I’m usually told that’s a ridiculous reason to feel so depressed, and then I just feel like I’m being over dramatic. Is that the case?"
1115,Help,I have this online friend who is messaging me about how they want to kill them selves and how he self harms. I need help as I’ve never dealt with a situation like this so I’m unsure on how to talk to him. He refuses to call a hotline or talk to a therapist as he says there useless and haven’t helped in the past. Pls help
1116,Tired of the pointless bullshit,"I wish I didn’t have to deal with so many stupid things that make me want to die. What if I don’t want to work but I also don’t want to be homeless? There’s just nowhere to go in this life and it feels like fucking slavery. Do this or else you’ll suffer sounds like fucking slavery and yet this is what life is. Fucking life is so cruel and sadistic, I don’t know how people are okay with the way things are. Realizing I’m a fucking slave hasn’t really done much to improve my situation, only until I break the chains. 

I spend all day doing nothing but looking into the ceiling and playing video games but there’s nothing I want to do in this shit world so I’m stuck like this. Life is too much fucking bullshit and I want out of it because what’s the point of living if you don’t like it?"
1117,My cats are honestly the only thing keeping me alive,"I would have killed myself by now. But my cats are afraid of everything but me. I don't know what will happen to them if I'm not around.. so I guess here we are. 

Though they don't really care if I cut myself. So at least I still have that."
1118,"Trying to find a light in complete darkness. Dramatic, I know.","I recently got laid off from a job I enjoyed very much. It was my “dream job” to have at my ripe age of 20. I left my boyfriend of roughly a year after this happened. I have a problem of lashing out at people and I knew I had something bottling up inside of me, if I didn’t end our relationship I know I would’ve lashed out to him. I know, I need to control myself better. I’m trying. He was my best and only friend I had. I wanted us to remain friends but now it seems like he’s much happier having nothing to do with me. I found out someone who I thought was my friend (also my roommate) has been perverted towards me and lies to me constantly. I have nowhere else to live but with that scumbag until I can get my job back. I’m traveling on the east coast to clear my mind from this but all I can think about is ending my life. I miss my pets (6 Guinea pigs, 1 cat, and 1 horse) back at home so much. I truly believe they’re the only things keeping me going. But even then the thought of wanting to hurt myself and end my life always takes over. Whenever I’m alone all I can think about is hurting myself as badly as possible or just ending it all. I feel as if my life’s been extremely unfair to me the last few years. A boyfriend I dated for roughly 1 1/2 years committed suicide. I lost all of my friends. My family disowns me and never talks to me. Every good thing I get in life gets ripped away from me in the worst ways. I feel so alone in the world. I just want to be free. I really feel like this time I won’t back down. But the fact that I’m reaching out says something i guess. If you made it this far through my bratty ranting, thank you."
1119,There's no way out,I feel trapped in life. I'm in a loveless marriage. My dad abused me when I was a child. My mom is a covert narcissist. My sister is too caught up in her own problems. As are my friends. I have no job and due to illness will likely never work again. I'm in my 30s and have nothing at all to show for it. I previously had therapy. Nothing helps. Nothing changes. I'd love to end it all but I'm too much of a coward. I thought putting it in words would help me but I feel numb.
1120,Everything is in order.,"I have letters to the five people who would feel like they could’ve done more. My social media is erased. I know somebody will check in on me and I’ve left enough food for my dying dog for a few days. 

I’m going to do it in the bath. The light is so near."
1121,"Some people believe that sleeping for long periods of time is how depression shows itself- I wish it was. I can’t sleep. Not for years. I’m depressed. I’m out of my mind.. When I sleep I dream and when I dream, I remember. But when I’m awake I can’t stop thinking. Fifty more years of this? Shit.",
1122,Can’t feel,I don’t really feel anything lately. I want so badly to cry &amp; to feel but I can’t. I only get angry or happy. I’m not depressed nor suicidal although I’ve been before. I’m so anxious &amp; I keep drinking. I need peace... I need a break
1123,I Hate my life,"Im so ugly, I have one friend, I always cry when I see big groups of people having fun. You all say you cant kill yourself because you love your parents and siblings? You are fucking lucky. I HATE my family and the only way I would ever be happy is if I moved out. But, I still have years before then. One of my friends started ignoring me. For no reason. I am not excited for anything not even holidays and I want to sit there and do nothing on my birthday. Sometimes I want to grab a gun or knife and rip and tear and shred my family to bits and splatter their guts all over the walls. You can call me crazy but that is for the the fucking mental abuse they put me through. When I can move away you don't understand how HAPPY I will be. I lie to myself to cope. I tell myself Im faking it and i'm happy or its not really harming yourself if you dig at your flesh with your nails or cut yourself with a shaver. But whenever I think of killing myself, I think of how happy i'll be when I move out and it stops me. Im so ugly why cant I be pretty like every other girl I see. No one pays attention to me no boys or girls think i'm cute they whisper about me and call me ugly a try hard or weird. I want someone to murder me or shot me. Sometimes I dream of a school shooting so that I can die. Im going to kill myself soon if things don't get better. Im not joking."
1124,Almost there,I’m getting closer to it... I’m not afraid
1125,I need to OD on something and get taken to the hospital to be brought back,"Maybe this is selfish I don't know how to explain why I want to do this. I want to OD on something and get to the hospital and get ""cured"". I can't explain the wave of emotions compelling me to do this with only words in the English language. I need to feel like people understand that this isn't some phase. I need more help than I get. Maybe this is me being an attention-whore. I want attention to get help. I don't know what to do.

P.S. What can I do that's serious enough to get taken to the hospital and have whatever I did reversed."
1126,I know how I will do it's just figuring out when,"I really dont know what to put here.  I guess this is where I put my reason for giving up.  Its nothing special. The world hasn't collapsed on me or anything that drastic, its just been chipping away at me.  First it wasnt too bad.  I could take it in stride, shrug off whatever was bothering me and try to enjoy what little comforts and fun there was to be had.  I don't even know when it got to the point that I wasn't so much as shrugging it off but just putting a mask on it and pretending it was all ok.  It's been a rough year.  I ended a 10 year relationship because my partner had cheated on me and even though I tried to work through that I just couldn't do it.  I was also falling for a friend I had met online and they where expressing the same feelings.  


The break up wasnt too bad all in all. I lost some stuff I liked but kept the house and my cat. The hardest part was the financial shift.  I was already the one paying for all the bills but I had to buy my own car now and money became super tight.  Right now I have $6 in my account and by the time I get paid on Friday, I'll owe the bank around $300 in overdraft fees and inscifficant funds charges.  My friend who I had feelings for ended up not really caring too much and kept putting roadblocks up between us so I stopped pursuing that.  I want to say that the loneliness is what really started to push me harder.  Coming home everyday to an empty house.  No one to really talk to.  I tried socializing more with my friends online but it became clear I was just a 5th wheel.  My friend I was attracted too, ""Abby"" I will call her, was the only person I truly talked to.  She was a good friend and even helped me out when I needed it a few times even with what little she had. Its why I liked her.  We would have our fights every now and than and stop talking for a bit but we always come around.  I have a feeling though she is tired of me and how I am always depressed.  I talked to her about how I'm feeling and her response was ""sucks to suck"".  I stopped talking about it to her and just put on a happy face and helpped her with whatever her crisis of the day was.  Recently I was playing some games with them and got in a bad way and not wanting to spoil the fun I muted my Mic so I could try to cry it out.  They ridiculed me rentleessly for muting my Mic and tried to tell them I was on a pbone call and I would join them in a minute but they kept on.  I left the voice chat and simce she was streaming I heard her and another friend laughing at me and calling me this and that.  I assume ive become somewhat of a joke to them and feel I'm being laughed at and talked about behind my back.  


I'm tired.  I tried the hotlines but they didnt help.  The lady I ended up talking to was really sweet and it wasn't as scrpited as I thought it would be.  But somewhere in the middle of the call I realised I didn't want help.  I ended up pitting on a happy face again and telling her I would trysome of the things she suggested.  I was pretty much trying to make sure they woukdnt call the cops or anything but I doubt I was considered that much of a risk at the time I called.  They did call back the next day and surprisingly it was the same woman, I guess it was just to make sure I didn't off myself or something.  Is it sad that the only one I feel guilty about leaving behind is my cat.  She is always there for, always jumps on my lap and is just the sweetest little kitty I've had.  All of this is affecting my job too.  I am constantly late and I'm probably on the verge of getting fired.  I bought 2 alarm clocks, super loud ones at that and I sleep through them.  I guess that will be the day I do it. Or at least the day I start getting everything ready.


Sorry this is long winded I tried to condense it but kind of gave up. I guess this was just for me to feel like I was telling someone a piece of my story or something.  Theres more to this story but its already a wall of text and I'm tired of typing in my phone."
1127,"I don't have the energy to type out what I'm feeling, kill myself and haven't left the couch for days.",Please talk to me.
1128,Today is a rough one...,"Maybe it's lack of sleep after a 12 hour graveyard shift. Maybe it's hormones. Maybe it's... I dunno. Something else. But I'm having a really rough time right now, and it's mostly loneliness.

I was just texting this guy. Bit of harmless flirting, I don't know him super well but we kinda hit it off when playing xbox. We got to talking about why I haven't been on a date in over a year because I guess he thought I was attractive or something, so I told him it's because I'm trans and people just aren't into that. He assured me he wasn't either, and that was the end of that conversation.

At the same moment, in my Slack group, a friend shared a photo of a board game he got. I was like ""oh that's way cool, you'll have to tell me how it is!"" and then realized it doesn't matter because him and his wife are the only people in my life who would want to hang out and play a board game anyway, so buying it myself would be pointless.

I guess what it boils down to is just weariness. The fact that I'm not even surprised the guy stopped talking to me because that's just what happens when I tell people I'm trans, it's the expected outcome now, and that fact is emotionally exhausting. I'm tired of sitting alone in my room playing xbox and wishing I had actual friends who would call me up and say 'hey, let's go do something' or 'why don't we hang out' or just anything to make me feel like anyone actually wants to be around me. I feel alone, ostracized, and completely unwanted, and I'm just tired of having to pretend like I'm okay with it..."
1129,We are supporting each other. But deep inside we want it to end.,"It's funny. How can we give hope and courage. Good thoughts and big dreams for a person in need. But can NEVER apply one single advice to ourselves.

I know I'm not alone in this. I know there people like me. Who are suffering from the unspeakable. But yet find a way to help and prevent someone from losing hope or suicide.

I'm sick of it. I can help everyone. I don't care what are you doing through but ANYONE and EVERYONE I've ever talked to felt good about his life and got hope and smiled no mattered what is going on with him.

But me?. Huh. Let's say I got to the point where I wear my ""happy face"" mask from waking up till being on my own after 2 am. 

Nobody can see through my well painted. Well defined mask. 
The mask I carved through years of sadness and untreated mental illness. 

Nobody even believe me when I say I'm sad because I'm just wearing a mask melted in my face. And sometimes I can't take it off. 


Somtimes I think I'm with 2 personalities. My mask is getting stronger and I stopped giving any emotions but within this mask. 

Then people say ""I wish I can be as happy as you. I wish my life can be as successful as you are.""

But deep inside me all I wish for is peace of mind. And a quite place to be in. Alone. I don't even want to see anyone. 

I got to the point that nothing can change me. I used to play video games for hours. Now I can't do it for half an hour before getting bored. 

People here fcked me up. I'm from Egypt. And I learned everything from movies and TV. Never really had a family or friends. 

Everyone toke advantage of my kind heart and my good soul. 
Untill my soul is no longer there. 

I don't know what am I doing or why I'm alive. But even though I want it to end. I can't do it myself. I tried 3 times. But too wise to vomit or break free before dying. 

And if you are still reading trust me you can still find hope and you can live a good life. Eventually. 

Here I'm doing it again. Giving advice I can't take. 

What am I doing here. What is the purpose of this never ending pain. 

Back pain. Herniated discs. Numbness in hand and legs. Stomach ache for more than a year. And can't sleep. 

I would like to sleep abs never wake up. This is my ultimate dream. 

But it seems like it's not my time yet. Guess I'll keep helping people around me. Maybe one day it end. 


I'm the person who is too stupid to find a away to live and too smart to actually do the job and die.

Like stuck in a meaningless life. Can't find happiness nor can't end it."

I know im not perfect but god dammit id never hurt you like this. Id never kook at anyone else. I thought i was enough for you. You were my best friend. I just wanted you tocbe happy. You to be able to live a healthy life. I love you more than anything. Maybe things ended ages ago but I was too naieve to see it but god dammit your solution was hurt me like that. Please don't even act like you gave a fuck about me when im gone. 

Im sorry about the rant just. Going through a lot didnt kniw where to post this I guess. Xoxo"
1135,Why shouldn’t I kill myself,"Life is easy I have a girlfriend who loves me very much and family that lets me stay with them 
Im still always furious I’m VERY uncomfortable in my own skin my very being disgusts me and all I want to do is hurt someone else or DIE even when I’m “happy” I look at myself in the mirror and feel humiliation every day I wake up fucked up because I wish I didn’t wake up or had an extremely lucid dream where I’m attacked or humiliated the love for my woman keeps me strong enough to continue but I don’t see the point in living past 30 with a single reason to live
Convince me I shouldn’t go MIA"
1136,"Its real ""wanna kms"" hours up in here",Useless post for useless me ✊😎🔫
1137,I am human trash. The worst of the worst.,"Over the past 7 years I have decayed into a mound of filth. I am no longer strong, vibrant, creative, empathetic, and intellectually formidable.

  I failed high school. When I clawed my way to college I failed that too. I have no job and no friends. My family looks down upon at me like the leper that I am. When I do find a job it will lead to nowhere. My ambitions and hopes for a career lie shattered under six feet of futility. Thus my future is bleak.

  I failed myself. I was weak. I am my own betrayer.

  I wish there was an easy way of deleting myself off this planet. But I am chained and bound by the obligation to not upset other by my death. And so I fester in chronic misery. 

  My face is ugly as sin. I lack the conventional success to give me comfort, shielding me where the stinging social isolation would have otherwise stripped the skin off of my bones. No. Now I am a pathetic failure AND social outcast. People assume I have nothing to give them- perhaps they are right. I have nothing to stoke their egos and self-assurance. 

  ""You have value!"", they cry. Oh yeah? Where were all of you when you saw me trudging my way through life? Nobody responded to my requests for help either. Fuck all of you who saw and ignored it anyways.

  If life has value then there's more dignity in death than continuing a disgraced existence.

  The real me died a long time ago. I am an imposter squatting in a hollow body. I pretend to be someone I am not. I repress my real beliefs and orientation so not to be unjustly oppressed by the very people I was supposedly able to trust. I guess that makes you all no-count rat bastards. I spit on you. 

  Maybe I can die in my sleep tonight."
1138,I'm pathetic.,"I had a post that I fucking lost by accidentally refreshing and I can't be fucked to retype it.

Bottom line, I feel like a fucking idiot for living this long, for posting here, for having this account. I have some cables in the wardrobe that I've previously used as nooses when experimenting, and eventually managed to nearly succeed with once before getting freaked out and scrambling to get the fucking thing off. I think I'm ready to try again.

I'm pissed off at myself for all the times I've felt like this and was either too tired and unmotivated to try again, or decided not to as if some reason to live would happily come along in the fucking morning. I'm a fucking idiot."
1139,I won’t be alive for the new year,"And that’s ok.

I feel like a massive weight has being lifted since i decided to go, it’s hard to explain but it kind of feels like everything will now be ok and i don’t have to worry anymore.
Only thing left to decide is the method but i have that down to two choices that i think can’t fail because i have to make sure I get this right this time and can’t afford to mess this up.
Be good to each other. 
Goodbye"
1140,just found out that my “friends” have been making fun of me behind my back for 2+ years.,"This may sound like shit since im only thirteen but i dont want to live anymore. I have known for the majority of my life that i am horrendously ugly. I have a bowl cut, no muscle, very unathletic and a horrible since of fasion. Last year i decided to home-school in hopes that i would get better grades because i passed like 2 classes in 6th grade. I have horrible ADD and that made homeschooling a nightmare. I decided to go back to school (a small school with like 200 ppl in it) and they just aren’t the people i used to know. They poked fun at me and when i tried to defend myself they told the teacher and i contue to get detention when they ‘tattle tale’ on me. I have tried to tell the teachers but, they always tell me to just tell me to get over it. Their most recent thing was calling me the kazoo kid from that shitty vine. Some if the other things is calling me the know it all from polar express, the ‘saint’ when i tried to tell a teacher and they invited me to a party where we watched home alone. They kept comparing me to that kid in it and it was just so bad. When i told them to quit calling me kazoo kid they told me that they were ‘laughing with me’ and that ‘i should be glad to be called kazoo kid’. I cant fucking stand my life. Im going to kill myself. I have some rope and a forest behind my house. If any of my classmates are reading this, this is your fucking fault and you should go to hell. Goodbye."
1141,I’m ready,"I just grabbed all the pills I could find and locked myself in my bathroom. Everyone is still asleep. I am scared that I will fail and scared i will succeed at the same time. I don’t really have a more reliable method at the moment, but I don’t think what I have is enough. Last time I almost attempted, it caused a lot of damage to the people I love. What is it going to be like when I actually attempt? What if I actually succeed? It is going to wreck them.... I just want out without hurting anyone."
1142,Pleas Help Me,"Hello. How are you? I hope you’re doing well because I’m not. I lost someone who meant very much to me the other night and it was from my own doing. My own mistake. And I can’t get over it. I love her so much and she was the best friend I could’ve ever asked for. She would take care of me and make me laugh and smile and could calm me down when I was upset. She would sing to me when times are tough. She thought her singing was bad but it was so beautiful to me. I love her so much and I was so blessed to have her as a friend. Well I made a big mistake last night and I unintentionally hurt her and she was upset and I made some more incredibly large and stupid mistakes that led her to being more upset and she won’t talk to me now at all. I feel terrible. All I can think about is her and I’ve been sobbing all day and earlier I was puking. I’ve also developed even more suicidal thoughts from my already existing ones from my current depression and sadness that isn’t related to her. I just hope she’s doing ok. I love her so much. 

This isn’t the first time this has happened so coming from somebody who hasn’t had any real true friends in real life, I’m starting to believe I’m incapable of having them. I believe that perhaps I’m just a bad person and bad to the core and there’s nothing I can change about it. I just wish I wasn’t always the bad guy. I just wish I could be a good person. I believe I deserve to die."
1143,Seeing my therapist,"Im currently abroad for an internship and i go back home in less than a month and i really dont want to go back to seeing my therapist.  She's vv nice, its nothing about her.  I just dont want to go to therapy.  I feel like its a waste of time and isnt helping. Im hella suicidal and i should go back but i cant be bothered to update her with how the last two months have been and how many times ive nearly killed myself or relapsed."
1144,I'm sorry,Im so sorry for being a bad person... I need to leave now. I no longer deserve to be here
1145,Long Term Inpatient or Suicide,"Does anyone know of low-cost long term inpatient psychiatric facilities in the U.S.? If not, then it’s over for me. I’m at my wit’s end. There’s absolutely no point in continuing to live if it just means I’ll suffer. My parents cannot and will not pay $10k+ a month just for mental health after paying out of pocket for the 2 times I’ve been hospitalized in short term care. They still hold it over my head."
1146,I messed up this decade,"I applied for a 5 year higher education course in 2011
While the course itself is pretty difficult to crack because of its competitive exam, I expected to clear all the exams in maximum 2-3 attempts

2019 is almost over and I have still not cleared my Finals

I am 26 years old and still trying to finish my education. All my friends are getting hitched and having good paying jobs

I failed myself, my parents, my friends and all those people who believed in me
I am a bloody loser who has not yet finished his studies, is jobless at 26, single and not in best shape of my health.

Now I have subsided into depression.
The walls are closing in on me and I dont have much time left

Thanks for listening. Happy holidays.

May the next decade be good for everybody out there."
1147,I wish I had one friend,"I have no one. I could die and no one would even notice, until the neighbors notice the smell and bills don't get paid. No one gives a shit. I have a few ""friends"" who can't be bothered to talk to me unless they want something, or want to use me as someone to vent to about their problems. I have no one to talk to. Those same friends won't listen to me for a moment. Not even chit chat. Really. I might as well not be here. No one wants me and I can't stand myself and I can't stand being alone like this. I have nowhere to go for christmas this year. I'm going to be alone. 

The fuck I'll give anything away ever again. My generosity and all the work I've put into gifts and friends in the last several years has gotten me nothing, nowhere, no friends that care. I can't believe how shitty these people are. I won't ever donate my time, my money, my effort or anything ever again because it has done nothing for me. I have no one. I have tried to be a generous, kind person. I have tried to listen to my friends and be good to them. 

They aren't even here for me. I suffered alone after major surgery in August. No one to help me at all when I got home. Just dumped off and fend for myself and not a single person could be bothered to help me. No one called to check on me. 

I hope they're all happy, I hope they took enough of me. 

I just wanted one person to care about me. And no one does, no one will. No one ever will. I can't stand being alive anymore. 

One friend would have been enough. One person to talk to who actually listens instead of waiting for their turn to talk, one person who cares enough about me to ask how i feel, how my day was, what im doing for the holidays. But the two people I thought I had as friends, just dump on me, vent their problems then \*click\*

They are far too busy to listen to me talk about anything ,even if I'm not wallowing in self-pity.

Ive tried to be more self-aware and not 'dump' on people. Now they just do it to me, then go on their merry way and don't care that they've not even asked me how i am. I barely exist as it is.

I have nothing left to give. Nothing left to take. I just want to stop breathing. I don't want to wake up."
1148,Second week in a row breaking down at church,There's a reason I don't get out of my house much. This always happens. I can't focus on anything. I keep constantly flashing back to my past and I miss my lost friends so much 😞 I need help.. please I just need a friend right now..
1149,Morose Sunday,"The only light I've seen today is the light of an energy lamp.

The house of my parents where this 30-year old forlorn life sudders on. My brother takes a nap in this same building and I wonder if he's feeling bad. And if I would abandon him if I left this house earlier than him.

The hair on my head is so easily pulled out. Trying to match my ground down soul, signalling my fraudulent self to others.

Music, books, these things we attribute great redeeming value to. But it doesn't do anything. 

I'm going for a walk, but it's to keep moving, just to be part of a city and maybe feel not alone.

Yet, for every lonesome face I'll see, it's better off without me. If only I could stop caring, accept my guilt, my shame, my chains.
How do others just live, chase the best, get most out of it all and know no echo of their past?"
1150,i’m stuck please help me.,i’m in a situation where i feel trapped. my legal guardian is my aunt but when i was younger her son used to molest and make me do things i don’t have any other family and i’m scared if i tell her she won’t believe me or just not care. but i cant keep pretending everything’s okay. i’m only a kid what did i even do to deserve this. i just want to stop feeling scared and wanting to die all the time. i just want to be happy. i cant face that side of my family at christmas. i’m stuck.
1151,I want to die and end this suffering.,Once I'm gone I would no longer feel pain.
1152,I wrote my suicide note. Now I'm trying to decide between pills (possible failure) and train (unlikely failure).,"I'm still afraid, though. I have about 4500mg of Sertraline (Zoloft) which I will take with alcohol, but might not be enough. Might also combine the two methods. The thing most holding me back at the moment is thinking about who will find me. I hate that I have to burden someone with that responsibility."
1153,I dont understand,"Its weird.... I mean after my suicide attempt, first one in about.... 3 years.... I really started noticing things I havent noticed before. Like I either ""FP"" (favorite person) people or I push people away. There is no in between.... like I am noticing that I have a lot of pain and am pushing people away in fear of feeling what I've been feeling a majority of my life. I dont want to make this post all about me, I dont want to brag or make anyone feel invalidated. I want someone to read this ans understand the walls that people build to protect f themselves from feeling such pain. Sometimes I make the wall collapse on its self and it harms me more. I also questioned if what is said to me is true or just complete lies."
1154,I'm just useless,"It just happened like that when I was 16. All the sudden I was being what people called ""emotional"". The first moment I was laughing at a joke and the next second I was crying for no reasons. I started crying for no reasons, like during a small conversation or a phone call. To avoid disturbing people, I managed to hold my tears till bedtime then I cried myself to sleep. Well, apparently no one actually cares about me crying for no reasons. It's the sudden attitude change that scares them, sudden death threat or being very aggressive. I don't know why am I being like this. I didn't want to. I just wanted to be like a normal girl. I am pretty much average already, grades, looks and know I just need to have a normal personality. Things just went downhill for me. I thought I'm just stress about school and exams, when it's over then I'm okay again. Well then in the end it's not because of school and exams, I'm just problematic. Poor grades, failed to accomplish simple tasks. Even things I used to loved now become stressful for me. I once loved a band so much but I couldn't afford to go to their concerts or buy their albums. I felt like a fake fan. I am not even worthy to be their fan. I just failed in everything including loving something. I felt like I just can't feel happy or feel love. Maybe I'm just not worth it. The world doesn't need a person like me. I'm just a waste of oxygen and space."
1155,Is it necessary to address your family members and the friends you once had in the letter ?,"I have kind of written about my pain and motivations, briefly."
1156,I might buy rope again,I bought before and I think I'm gonna buy rope again. They didn't help me at all in the 72hr hold. I was just trapped like how I feel now only trapped even more. The breeders have trapped me here. They're a bunch of fucking animals. I didn't consent to being born.
1157,I dont know what im doing and want to stop,I'm 25 and working a dead end job I accepted out of college. I'm realizing I'll hit a paywall and will never be able to break free or save up. I'll be miserable and living paycheck to paycheck forever. Other people my age have a career or are in grad school to get better careers and I'm still useless and clueless. I'm fucking done and want to stop fucking up like I always do. I'm so fucking tired. I want a redo on life. I'll be 26 next year and doing the exact same shit. I need to end it. It's my only way out
1158,Want to die but don’t want to kill my self,Basically the title I really want to die but I cannot come to terms with killing myself j feel guilty for even having thoughts like that as if it’s my fault. Anyone else going through something similar? (Sorry for typos I’m on my phone)
1159,I think one of my friend overdosed 120 panadol tablets,I ain't sure what to do. Does he need to force himself to vomit? He doesn't want anyone to know.....
1160,im tired,"does everyone feel this day-to-day struggle? hurting each time you breathe, like it's poison. your heart aching at each heartbeat, your blood slowly running through your veins and your body so heavy at each step. feeling on the edge of a ravine, standing on a foot, the other suspended in the air, trying to keep your balance and hoping not to fall. but, maybe, for a tiny moment, you hope to fall. it would be a relief. maybe falling it's better. maybe letting go it's better. can i fall?"
1161,I want to say sorry,"Sorry for my depression 

Sorry that I am suicidal 

Sorry that I am not listening your type of Music 

Sorry that I am 24/7 sad

Sorry that I have only 10 friends

Sorry that I exist"
1162,I am alone,"I was raped 2 years ago. It was my fault, I put myself into hat situation, I hid it from my boyfriend and once I finally told him he left me. I cant do this alone, I cant go through the legal process of getting justice from the man who raped me, or go through with reliving that incident to counsellors. I cant do it alone. I miss my boyfriend. I miss his support I miss having his shoulder to cry on and when i wake up in the middle of the night from the nightmares I miss having him hold me and reassure me it was all just a dream. I cant do this alone. I'm so alone. I dont want to do this any more I want to just die."
1163,Tried it all nothing helped,"At first it was just normal everything seemed better school, new girlfriend, immigration Court going well. Now I'm here alone, about to be deported and with no some to even talk to about anything.
I thought about all my options but I have none, smoking weed, drinking, working out, sleeping more, nothing helps... 
I've been told things get better but honestly everything just looks like it's going to go down hill. 
I think after Christmas it's going to be over for me. 

Also this post said ""think about all the wonderful things you would of missed out of if you killed yourself last year"" that's the last nail in the coffin lol"
1164,Humanity is inherently evil,"I don’t even mean like a Christian definition because I think salvation is the evil person’s way of pretending they have control over it.

Everything on this planet is cruelty. Turn on any news channel, cruelty. All the people in my life, cruelty. I’m just as cruel and evil as all the rest. Everyone seems evil. Humanity’s default state seems to be cruelty. I don’t see a single living human being capable of any kind of compassion or empathy that isn’t motivated by selfishness. That includes me.

Hell, Jesus was a selfish prick too for doing all those nice things just to get people to worship him as a god. Truly nice person wouldn’t be calling himself god. Doesn’t matter. Mother Teresa let people starve and stole charity money, Gandhi was a pedophile, George Washington owned slaves."
1165,A love letter to you,"To the beautiful you,

You are beautiful from the inside out.
You are an amazing person and you have greatness within you. You have a special uniqueness inside of you that no one else has. You were put on this earth for a reason and your times not up yet. 

I know this world we live in is strange and I know it’s hard to find the light among the darkness. But you are the light and you are all the light you need. There is a reason why you can see the darkness that others cannot. This is a gift and you are evolving. Don’t give up when you have come so far! Do not compare yourself to others we all have different paths to walk.

I reach out to you my friend and ask you to help change what is wrong in this world, through love. A simple act of kindness can warm another’s heart to duplicate another act of kindness. By sharing that beautiful light within you, we can light this world together.

Give everything you have, give your smile to a stranger, wave at the driver who stopped for you, give words of kindness, make someone laugh, we all have an excess of something that we can share. As we do this the light inside will grow brighter and we will ignite the light in others and through this we will help others overcome the darkness. 

You may think you have nothing, that your worthless and all the negative things you have come to believe and continue to tell yourself. But it’s simply not true, I don’t know you, but I know that you are special.

A few days ago I spent much of my time crying, this has been my worse year, and I just felt...empty. I have been fighting depression and anxiety for... my entire life. What I realised today is that I am free. A freedom from these invisible chains that have made me believe I was stuck beneath this glass ceiling. The chains that others told me I had and the chains I continued to tell myself I had. But today I cut the chains within my psyche, I will free myself and I will not allow the darkness that plagues another’s heart to effect the light within me.

I ask you to do the same.

YOU ARE FREE

If you are willing to clock out now then why not reach for your dreams? If you have nothing, then you have nothing holding you back. I hope you comprehend this as deeply as I do and I really hope that when you decide to end your life, rather than stoping the clock you choose to reset the clock and live the life you want to live. Recreate yourself, forgive yourself, move away if you need to, release the FEAR. You have one life and you can live it however YOU want. Don’t you worry about anyone else who try’s to hold you back or mould you into who they think you should be.

Because sometimes it’s not you, it’s just that you have been surrounded by assholes. Perhaps you were the asshole and you regret it and that’s why you have travelled this dark road. I get it, I honestly do. Press the reset button and live your life with the treasure of learnt lessons. It’s a big old world out there, if you have outgrown your childhood town then leave! You only have to go back if you want to. You are your own person. We all have options, search for your options and utilise opportunities as they arise.

Spread your wings and fly away to wherever you want to go. Because your still here, your not done yet, this is not your time. Help to recreate the world and save people from this ever expanding darkness that plagues the hearts and minds of innocent people.

Know that I mean this from the deepest part of my heart, and whoever you are and wherever you are. YOU are important and this world needs you, I need you and others needs you. I may not know who your true identity is but I hope that if one day I smile at a stranger that it might just be you smiling back at me. A you that is beyond happy, your light is shining bright and these dark days that you are currently experiencing was just all part of the journey of creating the true you, breaking free from the chains of who you thought you should be. Like a Phoenix rising from the ashes.

As I write this I answered my own question.

It’s not too late.

My heart is happy and it hasn’t been happy in a very long time, I deeply wish this for you.


I’m new to reddit but tomorrow I will delete this account when I wake up as I start a new day and cut the chains of negativity. I’m not sure if this will all delete with it so I’ll give it some time for  you to see it.

Good night and thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope it has at least a little bit of meaning. I know I’m a dreamer, but you know what, I really love that about myself."
1166,Goodbye &amp; Goodriddance,I don't think there's no use of me in this world so I'm going to kill myself on the same day I was born
1167,Im suicidal and toxic as fuck too( also im to stupid to understand the guidelines help),"Personally I have made a couple of aggressive post already and I apologize for that. Im used to saying shit that I know im probably not supposed to say. There is no way of coming around this because in my power I know there is nothing i can do. Personally i tend to feel bad because others feel bad. People might say thats bullshit but when I went to the mental hospital about 2 months ago I couldn’t stop crying, not for myself but from the things i hear happen to others. I see that there are guidelines and rules but pretty much what i see is this is a place for people to tell other people that they are going to kill them selves. This is also not a place to ask for help either(which is what i have noticed). This is not a place where you can help people. This is also not a place where you can get help. Because im still going through my depression and suicidal throughs I thought I could help people by telling them what I told myself. I understand that what I say won’t be accepted by others giving me another reason to shit on myself. I have friends myself who are suicidal and if they killed them selves I would most likely do the same. What im saying is since i care about everyone like a friend this Reddit has done nothing but trigger me in a depressed way. I don’t even really understand the guidelines but this Reddit is a place to put your Suicide note which is toxic. I will no longer be in this sub Reddit to watch people kill them selves. Nothing i see is supportive in any way. We are not allowed to help each other and even if we are its the bare minimum. Some of these you could be reading could be from people who are already dead. People shouldn’t be spending there time posting there Suicidal thoughts so that other suicidal people could get triggered from it(which is what happened to me). And you can say that you don’t give a shit about what i think or how I feel but that’s messed up. What ever you say in support will also trigger others. Seeing all this hopelessness just fills me with hopelessness. I learned that I want to surround myself with things that I want, things that make me happy, not things that make me sad. People talk to me like Im not depressed or suicidal myself in this Reddit. I learned that the best thing for me to do is do nothing at all. Some people might come on here saying “they don’t give a shit” or “fine just leave” however something else I’ve learned from being in a mental hospital twice is that those kids are not only mean to themselves but can be really cruel to others as well. They make me feel like I haven’t been through enough to be suicidal and hate my life. However they don’t know my life at all. They are one of the most toxic environments ive ever been in. When I say “step one is to calm down” they take it as calming down will make them happy. Thats not what i said and my words where twisted. That shows who is really here for help and who isn’t. I went to a hospital where someone slit there neck in the hospital. That’s nothing but sad to see. However, i have ran into the street and have been hit by a car so don’t act like im not as important as you and I have no reason to. IM DEPRESSED TOO, and when people attack me im only gonna get trigger. That has shown me that even those who have problems can still cause problems, not excluding myself. Stop being so mean to each other and try to have an understanding because not everyone is an asshole. Repeat: NOT EVERYONE IS AN ASS HOLE that is something I learned but that doesn’t mean there are alot of ass holes."
1168,I need advice/help,"I feel like giving up entirely. My girlfriend, who I love so much, lived hours away from me so I barely ever see her. She is constantly sent death threats, dick pics, rape threats. She been knocked out and almost raped by her ex best friend whilst he was on coke. He was texting me the entire time. She’s been stabbed, beaten, had her stuff stolen. Her dad abuses her daily. She hurts herself and has attempted suicide many times. Idk what to do. I try but I always feel helpless to support her. I have no friends I can really talk to and harm myself regularly. I just need advice on what to do before one or both of us commits"
1169,Taking 24 gummies of zzzquil,I will be taking 24 gummies of zzzquil combined with 30 2mg of xanax. Farewell.
1170,I will never get better,"I will perpetually lie. I will be perpetually sick. I'll chase bad choices. I'll spend too much, drink too much, smoke too much. I'll try anything once - maybe twice, maybe ten times when I like it. I'll always fall back down into the abyss. I'll always get high on my own choices and my own mania. I'm trying so hard to end it. I might do it tomorrow - but I'm scared. I'm scared I'll survive. I'm scared I'll survive and nothing will EVER be the same. They'll know my secrets hidden in suicide notes, they'll watch me the rest of my life, they'll never let me be alone. And then... I'm scared it will work. But I know part of my mind has already accepted it. I didn't study for my finals, because it doesn't matter. I have nothing planned for a Christmas party, because hopefully I'll be gone by then. My sister asked if I wanted my present now or on christmas, and it doesn't matter, because I don't plan on being there. I don't want to ruin their lives. But I can't do this anymore. I don't want to go to work or school. I don't want to see my friends. I don't want to be around my family. I don't want to think. I just want to die."
1171,My mother cries because of me,"I can't get a job and my mother cries. She is sad because everyone else is better than me.

What's the point of living if your own mother will suffer for you? What's the point of being alive or borne in the first place?

I won't commit suicide today, but it's just a matter of time."
1172,I’m going nowhere in life,"I don’t know if I’m just overwhelmed but I feel like my life is just going to crash and burn and thinking about it is killing me. I’ve never seriously considered suicide before so it’s really scaring me.

For the past two weeks I’ve been unable to eat, sleep or maintain focus or motivation on anything in life. I could barely study for my finals because things have been eating away at me. I’m constantly thinking of everything wrong with me and I just don’t know how to live with myself anymore. I’ve dealt with depression in the past in the past but it’s never been this bad. I never went to counseling until recently but at the moment I feel like I am beyond help. 

I’m a sophomore in college and I still don’t drive. I’ve never had a real job. I don’t know exactly where i’m going in life. It’s not like my grades are bad , but with no direction it feels meaningless. Looking back at my life it feels like a waste. I spent 18 years of my life I’ll never get back in a town I hate, and I don’t even like the few friends I have there anymore. I feel like i’m wasting everyone’s time. I was caught with weed at college and my parents will be more disappointed in me than ever when they find out. I don’t know who I am. I can’t even imagine my future because I don’t know if i’m going to make it that far. I feel like a complete failure. 

The only thing i’m holding onto is my friends in college. Meeting them has been one of the best things to ever happen to me. They’re like family to me and I love them. I’ve told them about my mental health getting worse recently, something I would never feel comfortable talking about with my friends back home. Sometimes I think if I stayed there I would have tried to end my life by now."
1173,Why is it so hard to get help?,"I reached out to every single therapist, psycolologist and psychiatrist in my town and surrounding areas and none will take new patients, my insurance, or just never responded.

I called the suicide helpline and they got me a number for financial help after being in domestic violence situation with my parents. They never called back... 

I called suicide hotline again and they got me a number for therapy help... First two appointments were all background questions... She didn't have anything to say about my tormenting nightmares, suicidal thoughts, and crippling anxiety... I set up my appointment for the 18th...

I get a call that she left the office and I need to reschedule with someone else... Next month!

I cant do this anymore. I'm begging for help but no one is out there. I feel so undeserving of any sort of help. I feel like I should just die in a ditch somewhere."
1174,Tried overdosing on sleeping pills,"I have been asleep for 20 hours. I cut my wrist and posted a goodbye note on the social media
Now for some reason I am awake and everything seems blurry and I want to vomit but I haven't eaten in more than 32 hours. I am almost hysterical then depressed. Out of the 100 people that saw that post called me to curse me and tell me to man up and the basic shit and shit I feel like nothing makes sense not only in my mind but in the material world as well 
I am sorry if it's all gibberish but I have also almost lost my vision and can't really see what I am typing."
1175,Slowly losing my mind over freaking studying,"Final deadline is on Thursday, I've already spent most of my free time on studying, and that's still not enough. 

I'm completely stuck. Everything around me looks just like a big amorphous blob of colors. I understand nothing and can think of nothing. Hearing sounds makes me feel pain. Talking makes me feel pain. 

And univercity's like: choose your graduate thesis theme till Monday. HOW THE HECK should I choose it if I completely hate everything about it? Although they will surely give us another week to choose it, I'm just so down that I cannot do this anymore.

Just kill me. Just fuckin' kill me until I blew everything."
1176,School keeps ruining my life at maximum efficiency,
1177,Suicide advice,"I understand that this sub has a policy of no encouragement, but is straight forward practical advice permitted?"
1178,Do I even have a right to commit suicide ?,"I wrote that title because I feel like I'm doing great for now. For example I have more than 10 friends that I can talk, I get into best state university of my profession and I'm doing fine, I'm currently learning new language. 

I mean I'm being productive if I want to. But last 1 or 2 month beside being productive I'm just daydreaming about myself or any of my family member dying for like a solid 4 5 hours before bed or during the day. 

And among my friend groups I get into a dozens of persona because that's what I'm used to it. When I'm not hanging out with anyone I want to ghost them and chill at home myself because sudden urge to fucking hate everyone is filling my head and I just don't want to talk to anyone. 

Sometimes this urge comes to me about killing myself too. Like 5 month before I was just laughing at suicide memes that I find found but now I'm really thinking to commit it because why should I bother if I can't be happy for a second with the demons in my head. So I don't know what the fuck is my problem. And I'm not like in need of motivation or mindfulness because they just seem so fkn dumb to me. 

So yeah that's about it ty for hearing me out. Sorry if it seems like a rant but I'm getting into suicidal phase slowly and I'm just being happy just to think about when I will die. I wish I just diagnosed by something so I can take some pills to shut the instrusive thoughts in my wicked brain."
1179,I want to die but my mom loves me too much,"I really want to die . I have been thinking about this for years, but my mom loves me tooo much.i know if I do something to myself my mom will hurt herself,since my dad is dead too.I don't think my sister will care.i started saying I want to die for months to my family but they think it's a joke.i have no choice but to live through the same shit show and cycle I go through everyday to make my mom happy. I'm scared of feeling like this forever."
1180,Did you think it you'd live to be this old?,"As a little kid, I'd never really believed I'd live past my preteen years. I'm 25 now &amp; it's awful, I cant even imagine what living into my thirties would be like.

How old did you think you'd live to be?"
1181,"Awareness post, please read..","So, about two months ago my best friend I’ve had my whole life died.. It’s had so many effects on me, my family, his family, and many others.. I still think about him everyday and how I just want to be with him, I’m crying even writing this. So please, if your going to commit suicide, please let this sink into your mind.."
1182,I’m thinking to jump in front of moving train I don’t care what it’d do to others,"I came from a broken home, my dad would take me to witness him beating my mom since i was a child. I was his favorite so he’d take me more often than others. I had to cover my mom with my small hands trying to reach all of her body to stop him because I know he wouldn’t do it to me, while my siblings would choose to hide away and I don’t blame them, that’s what i’d like to do too. Everytime they went out just two of them together, i’d be paranoid that dad would kill her. Fast forward growing up, mom found out he’s cheating and went crazy, she wanted a fair share of the wealth, dad got her to handle one of the business basically to shut her up while he’s in another town to handle and build a new life with his new fam. Mom got in touch with my uncle that’s crazily strict and wants to take over the business. He’d be in the office while his family would be at my house to make sure we weren’t going anywhere. Oldest sis ran away, tried to talked her out of it but found by him first, and got beaten up by him &amp; friends, thought telling my mom would be a solution but she said sis deserved. She was rebellious and always ended up with douchebag and I kept looking after bcs I know my parents don’t care about her till I lost my own teenage hood and had enough of trying to help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. Fast forward my brother ran away bcs my father basically always shout him bad things and didn’t value him as his son, supported him, months went by got a call from his friend he tried to commit suicide, fled right away to the other side myself, was disappointed how he would just leave me alone to fight everything, but it wasn’t his fault. I was suicidal as well at the time but I didn’t have the time to even address that issue. Told mom, didn’t believe and got mad at me, called dad to tell the situation and how he had to change, he went mad. Weeks go by with me looking after and panicking when he tried to commit again and trying to reconcile dad and him as everyone expected me to be the one since I’m the closest to both and I do care a lot to them all. I’m the 3rd of 4 of us, moved overseas to study and been away for 2 years, I’m 21 now. I decided to go to therapy and fix the damage thats been done. Despite the relapses I felt positive. My little sister came, panicked about if I ever have to take care of everything again. I loved her and didn’t want her to go through what I did or my brother did. We protected her too much she became sheltered. At home she’d be given things even when she say no so she never had to beg. I helped her move and everything but I want her to choose all the decision herself so I didn’t want to get in her way as we’re in different part of town anyway. When I helped I felt like I was invisible to her it hurt me so bad. She live in the house for short term and we didn’t talk because of previous argument. I keep blaming and questioning myself but at the same time hating and hurting.. I was also humiliated by the person I thought was my second family when I got back to my hometown and that also erased the hope. I don’t know how to process this and I don’t want to face this anymore. Whatever damage I’m trying to patch on myself, people just keep opening it again. I feel like I’m bound to this. I don’t what I keep doing wrong and I wish I knew. I don’t care anymore.. i just feel like i want to do something very selfish for myself right now"
1183,Killing myself soon,"Don't try to talk to me, I'm just making this post since I have nowhere else. I've had enough of this fucking bullshit so I'm just gonna end it before it gets even worse."
1184,cant forgive myself for hurting the love of my life.,"ive been with my girlfriend for almost a year she has given me everything i need and so much more. in the start of our relationship i did some fucked up shit like judging her life decicions and stuff which really hurt her. the worst thing that i did was sexting other people in the start of our relationship. i came clean about it a week ago and we both agreed that it wasnt cheating but really wrong and she forgave me. Now everytime we cry because we love each ither so much and when were together im so happy. but whenever im not with her the guilt kills me from inside making me wanna commit suicide i cant live 
with myself."
1185,"Low IQ, severe anxiety disorder, held back 2 years in high school and 1 in college; I want out ... 3rd suicide attenpt","I'm the bastard child of a mentally ill alcoholic; I've been held back by sh*tty genes and upbringing ... I just want out! There is nothing here; I cannot achieve my goals; I can't even bear the burden for a fraction of the time. Let me leave and please no afterlife of any kind; just an endless, dreamless sleep ..."
1186,I wanna die,"I'm so shitty, I feel shitty all the time, I constantly make other people feel shitty because they somehow can't fix my fucked up mentality. All I do is take and take and take and never give back, I'm impossible and yet people still have to put up with me all the fucking time. The one unselfish thing I can do is make sure they never have to deal with my stupid ugly horrid toxic ass ever again but even now at my worst point I can't bring myself to go through the process of ending it all. I'm a bitch to pain, I wish there was just a button I could push that would make me go poof and I didn't have to be here anymore in this shitty fucking world that only seems to hurt. AAAAAAAAaaaaaa, God I don't wanna feel like this but I know the only true way out is to stop breathing. Medication, time, therapy, they all only work for so long until I'm back to this horrid mindset where my brain craves seratonin so bad because it cannot fucking function on it's own. I'm a broken fucked up mess that no one deserves to put up with, and I've resorted to yelling at the internet in hopes of what?? Who knows. Fuck. I hate this. I hate myself."
1187,Looking forward to 2020 and not being here!,End this fucking lonely misery already. That is the only thing that makes me happy. No one is going to care anyway.
1188,"I'm a hated burden on everyone important in my pointless life, and I would be better off dead.","I'm 20M.

My parents and 7 year old sister all died young. I was physically and emotionally abused by my mother growing up and turned out as a sad excuse for a man who is overly sensitive and can't talk to anyone. 

I live with my older brother, his partner, and my 4 year old half brother. I work full time, go to college full time for something I have zero interest in (nursing), and then babysit this handful child for every other moment I'm home. We have another brother who is 15 and goes in and out of juvie and insane asylums. He is a narcissist, a violent sociopath, a thief, and a pedophile. He touched our sister before she died when he was old enough to know better, but he acts like he didn't see anything wrong with it. He stole from our dad when he was dying of cancer and set the shed in his backyard on fire for fun.

My life is so screwed up and the sad reality is that nobody cares one bit about me. I think about ending it daily. It would be a relief for my older brother to not have to worry about me any longer, and my younger one would grow up without me as a bad role model to make him like the narcissist turned out."
1189,I am too broken to be fixed :(,I remembered being punched by my dad when I was 5 . I didn’t want to have ponytails since it made my head hurt he told me he would do them and if I didn’t like them he would take them off and I didn’t like them and he got mad and gave me bloody nose. He didn’t take me to school and asked someone to watch me. He gave me two more bloody noses one in middle school and in High school. They would always humiliate me about my weight I tried not eat a lot but as soon as a ate as a normal person my weight will go up. Turns out I have chronic illness dealing with my digestive system I am always in pain and nauseous. No one in my family takes my illness seriously they make fun of my I can’t complain about my illness. When I was young my dad cheated on my mom and he took out his anger on me and my other sister I have 3 siblings. My sister and I have a bad attitude but I don’t blame her they ruined our childhood.  My parents don’t owe up to their mistakes they put us in the middle of it when dad cheated on my mom. We had to leave the country for a few months when it happened it was affecting us at school. The lady my dad cheated on my mom had everyone of their child bully’s us at school and bothers us back home. I am always sad they always comment on my weight when I can’t even control it. I always have to be on medicine. I just want to give up on life already. The only thing that keeps me alive is my bf but sometime I wish he would find someone else so I can just end everything without guilt. I don’t feel bad leaving my family behind. My dad told me he prefers me alive so he doesn’t have to pay for the funereal.
1190,What stops you from going through with it when you’re on the edge?,
1191,Anybody else get hate messages from a username necessary evil?,
1192,Please help me,Please help me I can’t stop crying WHY WONT ANYONE HELP ME???
1193,Testing the waters/New friendships,"For the past few weeks I have been putting myself in a set up that would theoretically allow me to exit instantly. By this I mean, I have found a place in my house I can hang myself from, I have a very strong rope and a stool that keeps me from falling and dying.

I stand on this stool, with the rope tightly around my neck, secured to a strong place, maybe once every week day. When I am up there I wobble around the stool with my feet. Sometimes I jump on it, hoping it will break. It should be noted that the stool is an old plastic one from ikea, it is meant for children so it's not unlikely that it would break under my weight. One time, while I was moving my feet around on the stool, my foot slipped off and for a second I was actually hanging, I managed to get my feet back on the stool though. 

I have been much happier lately, generally speaking. I have made good friends that make me so happy. I am myself around these friends and I feel safe being myself when I am around them. It feels so good to be myself, almost too good. The thing is though, I cannot be myself with out them. Maybe this is because I am surrounded by people who make me feel uncomfortable or unsafe all of the time.

I feel like I am almost addicted to being with these friends now. I know that sounds weird to say but what I basically mean is, I feel really happy with them, and incredibly low when I am without them. It has gotten to the point where there is no in between anymore.

I fear that I might lose these friends, I feel like I should exit before I lose them. Again, I know that sounds weird to say, but I have never really had friends like this; friends that I can be myself around. I lack a lot of the social skills that most people have and I say/do a lot of dumb things. I really don't want to upset or offend these friends and I have so much trouble understanding how they feel, it frustrates me. My friends seem to have a good time when they are with me, why else would they hangout with me. I just really dont understand if they are having a good time or if I am upsetting them. I fear everytime I see them or talk to them that it is the last time we will ever be friends. I know my thought process isn't very realistic and it is extremely paranoid, but that is how I feel. It makes me so anxious just thinking about all this.

I dont know if this is the best place to post about this, but I don't really know any other place. I want to live and be happy with these friends, and I know that is actually a possibility now (which is just crazy to even think about) but my fear of losing them almost out weighs my desire to spend time with them, this makes me want to exit. I don't really know what else to say. I know this sounds silly, I cant explain all of these feelings because friendships like this are so new to me. Right now I do not know how to be myself by myself, I can only be myself with them. If I lose my friends I will lose myself in the process.

I really need some advice or any kind of insight really. I'm embarrassed to make this post because I feel like this should not be an issue, but this issue is causing me an extreme amount of pain and anxiety. I'm sorry for making this post, I really don't want to upset anyone."
1194,"I’m turning 19 in a few days, and I’ll be lucky if I make it.","Hey y’all. If anyone even cares to read this whole block of bullshit that I’m going to spill, just know that I appreciate you taking the time. 

So like many of you here, a life time of suffering has gotten me to this point; Whether it’s the abuse and neglect I’ve received as a child, whether it’s me growing up completely isolated and away from my family, whether it’s me failing at school and my passion (I’m a singer and musician), or the completely filthy and run down apartment I’m currently living in; All of it plus more has gotten me here. 

It’s a bit surreal knowing I’m going to spend my birthday alone, considering that’s what I do every single day. I’ve tried for so long to believe that *I’m not here and this isn’t really happening*, but the truth of the matter is that nobody cares about my existence and I’m merely just a nuisance. From putting my all into people without return, from my father leaving me by myself all the time for more than ten years, or from people who’d rather like your stupid pictures  on Instagram than have an actual conversation with you, even when you’re asking them about their *own* lives; It’s really clicked into my brain that I mean nothing to anyone other than myself. 

But I’m not any sunshine either. For the amount of awful things I’ve been through in my lifetime, I’ve done my own fair share of making others suffer. And that’s the hardest part, knowing that I’ve made someone feel the way that I so terribly feel every single day with my depression and OCD. Even if I was super young and stupid, or maybe not even aware of what I was doing, I still feel it. 

Sometimes I can’t believe I’m only going to be 19. Mentally and physically, I feel at least 30 years old. Because I’m just so fucking tired. 

I don’t even feel bad for myself anymore, but for humanity. Looking at the shit that people do to each other, or have to endure through their life time makes me utterly disgusted, angry, and helpless. The worst part is that nobody lifts their hands and nobody lifts their eyes, because we’re all so worried about our own damn misery and predicaments. 

It’s all bullshit, and I’ve had enough of it. I’ve thought about running away, but I literally have no one along with no money. I wanted to join the military but I didn’t graduate because my mental health absolutely tanked. I love being a singer and making music, but no one gives a flying fuck since there’s a million other joes doing the same thing. 

I don’t have any other options. And I’m sick of all this suffering. I just don’t want any of it anymore. If you got this far, thank you a ton. Bless you, and I hope your own situation gets better if it needs to."
1195,When is suicide/self harm a legitimate solution?,"G'day

Just come into some problems in my life and I just want to know if my suicidal feelings are legitimate or am I just an insensitive prick deep down?"
1196,I think it’s time.,So I recently got out of jail for violating my probation. I was in there for 2 months. A week after I’m released I become ill. I come to find out I’m diabetic and didn’t know it. So I spent about 2 and a half months out of work. In that time my co workers have grown to dislike me. And they admit it to my face. So I turn back to my getaway. I did some drugs. I did them on Thursday night. And I forgot I’m supposed to go into my probation officer to visit with my drug abuse counselor. Now I’m not for sure but I’m worried they might drug test me. I don’t know if I’ll pass. I’m very scared to go back to jail and I believe I’d rather be dead. I’m angry all the time I have no freedom and have become a very disliked person by my peers. I don’t see any light anymore. I can’t talk to anyone because there’s no one to talk to. I’m sad. I started cutting again last night to stop thinking of the pain of returning to jail or back to work where I’m unanimously hated. I’m so scared.
1197,"I treated my ex-boyfriend terribly, I manipulated and cheated. I don’t know how to go on with my life.","I was an awful boyfriend, I was inappropriate and manipulative. i cheated. The guilt of it all is overwhelming. I started cutting the day I was discovered, and I continued doing so for about two months. I stopped about a month ago, which I’m proud of, but I still get the urges every other day or so. 

My ex is now dating my old best friend and won’t acknowledge that I exist. I am still very deeply in love with him and every night my mental state seems to be getting worse. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to hurt my family by taking my own life but I want nothing more than to be rid of this pain. Therapy isn’t helping, antidepressants aren’t helping. 

I’m sorry Otter, I’m glad you’re with someone who treats you right and makes you happy but I miss you more than you could ever know."
1198,Update,Well from. My last post I took a break from my phone and everything and was able to stop myself from killing myself. But another horrible thing happened in my life. I have a 58 in a class 2 points from passing and my parents already said that I get kicked out of the house if I fail. I’m scared that this will be the time I finally end it. I have been miserable all day and at this point I haven’t felt any happiness in weeks. My teacher refuses to help me. I feel like I’m in a endless hell of my parents emotionally abusing me and that makes me worse at school. Causing for the cycle to repeat making me just want to end this shit life I have. I’m at the point to where I have access  to a fire arm incase I need to just leave this earth and be peaceful hopefully gone from this hell I call I life.i have no future. I give up I can’t do this anymore
1199,I remembered why I can’t kill myself,"Mostly cuz of my Mom. I probably can’t do that to her. And that makes me hopeless. I just want to die to escape from all of this.

I want to remember myself before, when I actually went a long period without thinking about killing myself, even though I was depressed to all hell as well. Oh maybe not, cuz that sucks, just like it sucks now, I probably never found a reason to live then, I just, knew that suicide wasn’t an option.

I did find a reason to live later though. But I’ve lost it. It’s destroyed for me, I don’t know if I could ever have it back.

Everything is dark and scary. Perhaps myself included. I want to die so bad. Please, take me away, I can’t bear this life any longer."
1200,Some content may be emotionally triggering,"I have a severe mental illness. Well I think I do. I don't know.

When I was younger than 12 I was neglected. Severely. I wasn't abused, if spanking counts. Lots and lots of spanking. But we (my brother and I) only got spanked for getting in trouble. Like the time I was 6 and he was 8 and we took my grandfathers loaded 9mm and 12 gauge and they had to call the police to find us after dark. We lived in the deep country of Kansas. Oh, not as important as the neglect part, but I also had a drunk, verbally abusive step dad that tore down the christmas tree and held a knife to my mothers throat swearing to kill her, then my older brother, me, and my younger brother (9,7,2.)

When I was finally put into state custody for refusing to go to school, never once did anyone sincerely care for me. I was fed, housed, made to do work on the farm (which I am ok with.) But I never had anyone sincerely care for me. That was why I attempted suicide first.

Then I met her. At this point, I was already super depressed and getting mixed into the wrong crowd. But for that christian girl with the pretty smile, I'd disown my friends and every bad thing about them. I wanted to be cared for. I wanted to be loved. I wanted to be wanted.

Well her family took me in. Super weird relationship, honestly. I was her boyfriend but her mom knew my story and took care of me. Loved me like a mother. I was part of a family. Her sisters felt like my sisters. 

I only attempted suicide (seriously) less than 1 time during the time we dated. It was when her little sister got a boyfriend. He started coming over and being as nice as me, except he came from a nice family. Unlike me. Obviously I have every right to believe he is my replacement and everyone I love is leaving me for someone better than me.

After 2 years of feeling like life was ok, that unstable relationship of that 18 year old fell apart, along with his world. Nothing is right. Since then I've attempted suicide, recorded, I think 3 times. Unrecorded, there was most definitely a major unrecorded suicide attempt. A minor one before a major one. A seperate minor one. 

And don't even get me started on how reckless my driving used to be lol. It's all good now though. I wear seatbelts, follow traffic laws, and make sure I'm as safe as possible. 

Why? Because I'm waiting to die. I have accepted death, fully. I'm terrified, but completely willing to die at any point. I carry around a faux DNR in my coat pocket in case I'm found unconscious and dying.

 I think I broke my hand a few weeks ago from where I punched a wall (I'm not a wall puncher, I was angry and it's one of those ""discuss with a psychiatrist"" things, ya know?) It swelled up, hurt, my entire arm hurt for a bit, but it just stopped a few days ago. I got gonorrhea in college, mainly because I slept with anyone willing. I probably have an STD still. I have bladder pain, constantly, and a pain in my right flank when I urinate. I told the doctor but he didn't care. I've been to the ER multiple times for cannabis related panic attacks. But I never see a regular doctor.

I can hardly take care of myself. I have a difficult time finding energy to shower. I had a miniature schnauzer, from the time it was a puppy to 1 year old. I neglected that dog so badly. Not on purpose. I love animals. I worked at petsmart. When I was with my ex i trained our dog (he was a mini schnauzer chihuahua mix) to play dead after being shot with a finger gun. He would say ""roo roo roooo"" whenever I told him I loved him. I love animals. I love animals so much but I just can't do anything.

I beg to god to kill me and I tell him ""If you love me, and know me, why won't you let me die?"" I am openly agnostic, and I don't know why I beg to the God of Christianity.

I don't know a lot of things. For example, I don't know if I have Borderline Personality Disorder. The screener said I might, but I was also told to go to outpatient therapy at my last suicide attempt visit. That was like September last year. I haven't seen a medical doctor for a check up in over 8 year"
1201,In a bad spot here,"As long as there is smokes and alcohol, I am okay I think. I am looking for a job to be a dishwasher or at CVS/Walgreens cashier, it's been four days since I've applied. Unemployment is literally killing me. I dont have purpose to continue, I am very paranoid, anxious and depressed. I am very scared of the psych ward and hospitals, I cannot see myself taking pills to ease my suffering. My siblings are on medication/therapy and I refuse to be like them...

I smashed my hard drives for my computer because I was going to kill myself but I never had the means and clearly not the will. So I have no computer, just this phone here. I can only use it when it's charged, and cant use it when it's charging. I am 20k in debt, everything little thing takes work, I have very noticeable eye shadows. My father gives my sister money to food shop but they never buy for me. My sister, brother and mother are very crazy and I think they are out to get me. My father obviously regrets having children, and he is upset with me of course.

I am scared and sad everyday. I am trying to get away but I must live here since I have no where else to go until I fix my debt/life but even then I don't ever see myself being happy. 

I wanted to move out West, hike, take care of my health, have an apartment, play games, love the West but here I am wanting to cease to exist. 

I had sex with escorts and I have never felt so dirty in my life. Every little thing is a God damn challenge."
1202,Crying in the backseat of my parents' car,I'm sitting here. Everything inside is hurting. I'm thinking about what to write on my suicide note.
1203,Can't get away from my toxic parents,"When I was 12 days old, my biological father left my mother in lots of debts caused by him. My aunt told me that mom actually thought of aborting me but she told her to keep me. When she gave birth to me, my grandpa was going to make my father have my custody instead of my mother, but again, thanks to my aunt, he felt that he shouldn't. Since he didn't pay any child support, mom worked lots of hours to take care of me. When I was 3, she married my stepdad. My stepdad was not like a stepdad, he tried his best to raise me. 

Even though I had a family, I stayed with my aunt for the most of the time. She still has her restaurant to this day. I remember when she bought me a samsung desktop between 2004-2005. I learned how to read and write when I was 3,5 so I had an MSN where I texted my mom when she was at work. Since I was introduced to internet way earlier than my peers, I learned English faster and started roaming around reddit and other sites. I had a nice life before my sister was born in 2009. Everything messed up right after that, since I had a little sister who got what she wanted. My parents thought that I was ""just being jealous"" but in fact, I was just angry because I had to beg my parents and they never got me anything I wanted. I clearly remember wanting a small mp3 player and they never got me one. Then my sister's babysitter, who was aware of the situation got me one for my birthday. Then guess what? It was demolished by my sister after my parents forced me to share it with her. My parents mostly sided with my sister when she was the wrong one, my aunt and her daughters thought that they were being mean to me. I never got along with my sister. 

Anyways, in the years between 2015-2018, my stepdad kinda gone wrong on everything. He smoked marijuana, cheated on my mother with two women, lied about going to his male friend's house but it appeared that he went to stay over to his ""girlfriend"", quit his job and made my mom work while he stayed home. Those were the yucky times. I was planning on going to an art college and my parents didn't have money to send me to an art class. In Turkey, you can get scholarships to art colleges with your talent. My mother never approved and would mock me for wanting to study Cartoon&amp;Animation and say that if I win full scholarship I could go study there but they wouldn't pay a single penny to the school but they would pay if I got into an Engineering or Health related school. Guess who won full scholarship without the help of their parents? Me. My aunt always wanted me to study art because she saw my arts being nice and I could do it. After winning the scholarship, my mom made Instagram and Facebook posts saying ""My beautiful daughter won full scholarship, I always believed in her"" . My aunt and her daughters were    s h o c k e d.   


Remember the time when I said I was roaming on the internet? That changed me a lot. Now I have the views of typical Europeans and Americans about life, which is totally different than people in Turkey. I mean, since people in Turkey are Muslims, they are against drinking, eating pork, celebrating new year, wearing like a goth, couples hugging/kissing/having sex etc. I have a different mindset from my parents. If they knew what I did to this day, they'd disown me. Now they kinda force me to act like a muslim. We have fights over my clothing, my makeup (I am a goth but not a heavy goth) my boyfriend and more. We recently had a fight with my stepdad about new year stuff and he banned any ornaments, drinks or fun on that night. What a muslim, right? I told him that I don't believe what they believe and they yelled at me with my mom for hours. I went to a psychiatrist a while ago about my parents and life. I was struggling a lot back then. I got diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety Disorders, he gave me some medicine and called my parents in but they didn't come. After that they insulted me saying I could have lied to him. When I told them that I can't talk to them because they never listened to me and always judge me for everything, they said that I was the problem here since I didn't know how to communicate. They didn't even think what they did to me to be more introverted towards them.   


To this day, whenever I go shopping with my aunt and her daughters, they know what I want. I am used to not being vocal about my requests towards my family so they spent time to learn my body language and likes to help me a bit with stuff I want. But I still have problems with my mind. Whenever I try to buy myself some clothes, I always think what my family would say about them. Or would they let me wear them in public.   


I really want to move out but I don't have that eligibility since I can't find any jobs. That's how Turkey is. You can't find a part time job, you can't find a full time job. I also need a new computer since my parents can't get me one and we will be making computer based animations next year. I am really having hard time living a life like this, I have breakdowns very often."
1204,Ruined a lovely family day,"Was supposed to go to watch Christmas carols today with my parents, grandmother, aunt, and boyfriend, but completely lost my shit, the trigger being not knowing what shoes to wear. My emotions get more and more out of control the older I get and I’m having tantrums like a two-year-old now that I’m nearly a legal adult. Crying, screaming, freezing up and not being able to move. My loved ones just want to help, but I snap and yell at their every move. I see a psychologist but can’t get in until January. We ended up not being able to go to the carols because I was so hysterical and nothing calmed me down - not of the tactics I’ve learned at various psychologists, nothing. I always do this. I always ruin family events and other people’s days because I get overwhelmed and lose it. I’m toxic to everyone around me and even after years of therapy, I’m getting worse, not better. I don’t bring joy or happiness to anyone in my life, which is why everyone, if they have the opportunity, leaves me. My family have to stay because I’m incapable of taking care of myself, and my boyfriend only stays because he feels bad for me. Every time I think I’m getting better, one little thing sets me off, and then I’m worse than before. I can’t keep living like this. I’m a human leech on everyone I encounter. I contribute nothing to the world. All I do is take, take, take. Everyone would be better off without me, if I only had the fucking guts to do it."
1205,Nothing interests me,"I don’t have anything like interests or things in my spare time I don’t have a personality I change it so whoever I’m talking to likes me more and idk who I am anymore

I always thought that everyone had a reason to keep going something they’d put above anything else and it doesn’t have to be specific maybe you really like having personal connection with people or whatever I guess you could say it’s your own personal meaning of life 

My reason was having that one person that I can live with everything I have someone I don’t have to change who I am I’ve had that twice in my life and those times were so short I’d give everything I have what little that is to go back I remember that day that one stupid day where it all started I was hanging with some “friends” smoking trying to forget about everything and idk why but I asked one of my friends to add like ten random people and he just fucking had to add him why him but moving on we start talking and things progress and next thing you now he said he had a crush on me no one before him ever told me how they felt first and everything just stopped nothing mattered I didn’t care about school work I didn’t care about family nothing I was soo happy and we dated we went on dates late at night at this local park and we just sat there and talked and I didn’t have a care in the world he even kissed me he kissed me a stupid fucking bitch like me and he chose me why why would he put me through all that just to break it off but apparently he still has feelings for me but he’s dating someone else so idk what to do I just blocked him than unblocked him than blocked him again and I really want to unblock him I really want what we had back but I know it won’t happen I’ll just disappoint myself again like always but whys he the only one I can think of why she the only person I want to text

I just can’t feel anything other than sadness lately I’m either sad or too numb to feel anything anymore I tried therapy for like one session but I couldn’t bring myself to go back I just idk sometimes it just feels like it would be easier to just stay sad idk anymore I go back to school soon and I’m hoping that might help cause staying home all day doing nothing is driving me crazy but I was still looking at a date for when I should do it I can’t do it until like February cause I go back to school end of January but I can’t kill myself that close too my sisters birthday cause I don’t want my death to get in the way idk so I’m think maybe sometime in March but idk anymore 

I’m sorry I can’t keep a coherent train of thought and I probably won’t respond but I needed to share this somewhere"
1206,does anyone feel like they don’t have a good expression of death,i think i want to kill myself because i have like mild depression and i don’t have a sense of death. to be clear i’ve been diognosed with severe depression but i am certain that it’s mild. yeah idk where i’m going with this
1207,Has anyone else felt suicidal /had PTSD as a result of a bad surgery outcome?,"I had a traumatic orthopedic surgery, leaving me with pretty severe ptsd and development of suicidal thoughts, anger, regret, mental breakdowns, etc. The surgery happened when I was 16 and I recently developed PTSD from something that triggered it. I'm worse off now after the surgery, and now I am feeling suicidal and angry that it happened. just curious if anyone can relate.

BTW - I am in counselling...I am not actively suicidal. I have suicidal thoughts everyday from this. I am wondering if anyone can relate. I feel alone. I've never talked to anyone who's developed ptsd/suicidal thoughts from a surgery. I don't know if it's common or not."
1208,Can anyone recommend literature in methods,"that are the cleanest methodologies to end one's life?

I am fresh off mental breakdown, but the process of that breakdown has cost me a lot. I have 6 kids and stay at home wife, if a certain trigger happens ), my need to die will be a race against the clock before my actions would I cause non physical harm to family. my suicide would too, but much less than the other action.

I hope it never comes but if it does, I'd like to be prepared.

I'd like something portable, and not messy/violent. 
 
I cant get into the whys but it would be in their best interest if that certain event happened.

I am not upset or sad so I am not asking for that kind of advice, just the cleanest, hopefully least painful way to end it in. a hurry.  

PS
A failure to plan, is a plan for failure."
1209,Mentally exhausted,"I don’t know what to say except I’m extremely tired. I’ve lived with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I tried and tried to get help when I was in my early teens but my parents mocked me. I was told to read the Bible.. My mental health was just thought to be bad spirits. I just accepted that I had these issues and believed the narrative that it was the world working against me. I just became a shell of a human. I just focused on building a career by going to college and majoring in a shit degree that got me nowhere. I ended up in dead end jobs that were toxic and ruined me even further.

I kick myself everyday for not taking care of my problems sooner.

Now, I find myself without insurance and struggling to live a healthy, productive life. I’m behind my peers socially and just seemingly inadequate.

I can’t find a way out or help. I’m just suffering alone.  I’m 27 and have been dealing with this since I was 11. The years of rumination, anxiety, depression, overthinking and over analyzing has finally caught up with me.. I’M TIRED. My mind is in pain. I don’t care anymore. I have experienced so much trauma.

I always try to find ways to not do anything stupid but this time.. It’s hard."
1211,A Poem About You Know What,"The intellectual fornicating inside my mind

The demons pumping through my chest

They all shine a beaming light to anyone who might be interested

Lost at sea and looking for refuge

Inside a safe and quarantined space

To wreak havoc and produce spawn

It’s a centrifuge of ugliness

That keeps the world upside down

Eating away at its axis

My words are teeming with rust as they lay to waste inside my throat

Like an ancient shipwreck

Come, come together

Beautiful children of the night

I’ll tuck you in

And wish you to sleep oh so very tight 

Don’t you let my hopes and dreams bite

Come, beautiful children of the night,

I’ll be your mother 

For all the years you had swum across the ocean aimlessly

Looking for a tit to suck on 

It’s a place where you can overgrow

Like the ugly malevolence that you are

A place nothing ever changes

A fatality of the mind that will quench your thirst

A numbness inside that will make you wet 

I reiterate - this is not a curse

Come, beautiful children,

I will be your mother

And I will let you kill me

I will teach you what is love

Before anyone else can free me

I am your host of lies and I am your lover

Isn’t that what it means to take care of one another

I’ll let you eat away at the remnants of the little girl trapped inside

Right from my rib cage like a bowl of Haggen Daz

Fatherless and helpless

I have seen you grow with time 

You have swarmed inside my body

And you have taken what is mine

You ate away at my soul

And now there’s nothing more to give

Forget. Let go. Forgive

Concepts I have forgotten 

Concepts I had myself conceived 

Silly little notions and token of the meaning of humanity

I feel so light and weightless

With my fingers pointing downwards so effortlessly

As my body sinks into the depths of the ocean 

Children I had love

Tyrants I had seasoned

Treat me like a mausoleum now 

A cautionary tale

For all those who dare

Their own humanity to fail

Adorn me with your toxic waste

Live inside my bones

Use my hair to build intricate bridges of lies

Make me beautiful like I had never been

Show the world through your masterpiece

All the travesties I had seen

Tear off my limbs and make a fort

To ward off all the empty promises that may drift your way

From the earthly demons, I had to consort

Only in death

Will I exist

Righteous and firm

No green meadows of the mind

Nothingness oh so sweet."

1214,I won't see the new decade. I just want someone to know my story.,"An befitting end to a 10 year old saga of failure, pain and disappointment. For 10 years i kept chasing her, for 10 years i was hoping that she would see me in a way i want her to see me.

After 10 years she is moving away and i could barely come to terms with that but then she gave me something which broke the last strength i had. She returned my shirt which she wore when she visited me one day ! It was a clean fresh piece of clothing..

On her last day she gives it back to me with cum stains on it..Talk about a going away present !

As i said earlier, that cum stained shirt is the best way to represent myself in her life..i wipe away the tears and the jizz of other men.

I am lost, broken and hurting so much that I had to say this to someone before i sleep for the final time. I can't bear my friends and family to see me like this. My family loves me a lot but i can't live like this. I don't want them to know how i am right now. I want to them to remember me as a cheerful person i once was.

I constantly felt like there is a dagger in my heart but today it is like someone plunged it further and twisted it. The pain is unbearable.

i want someone to know about me ! I would take solace in the fact that you have read it.. Someone out there knows who i was, how i felt and why i chose to do it.

Thank You."

1216,Ever get to the point where suicide even seems like it doesn’t matter?,I feel like I don’t matter to anyone in my life. All friends coworkers love interests family all seem like they interact with me out of necessity or because they have to or are just trying to be nice and humor me. I’m so alone so often and feel like every time I reach out to anyone to feel some kind of human connection I’m being a burden or being annoying. I thought about just ending it and killing myself but even then I realize that no one would care and life would go on. I’d just be cheating myself.
1217,Why,"Is it so hard to end all this suffering. I tried but I’m afraid somehow. I tried but decided to get rid of the rope and I HATE myself for it. The only thing I want is cry in a corner, close my eyes and never see light again!!! Our bodies are alarming that it’s not okay and natural and I know but I just want to die ohmygod. I am so tired, am no good. The first thing I think about when I wake up is death, this has been going on for weeks. And no; it doesn’t get better, there are things that can’t be fixed .. it’s too late. The world doesn’t need me and I hate that I can’t end it myself."
1218,My children would miss me if I was gone,"They would grow up and miss their mother every day. They're why I have to keep trying. I can't go yet, even if I'm so damn tired."
1219,im so weird ive had enough of myself,"I have no personality, I can’t articulate myself. So pathetic"
1220,Im planning my suicide.,"Im already having weird feelings about writing this. But i have realized that im finally ready to do this.

From outside im a normal guy, 25, single, active, smiling a lot, making jokes around friends, living in a one bedroom apartment and has decent income. 

But i feel like im tired of self motivating about different things in life.. i think i have never truly feeled loved as well. I have always valued people, and have been let down and now im just used to this and its really hard(maybe even impossible) to have feelings again.

I feel like i was searching for a reason, or just something to keep me going for the last couple of years. Because deep inside i knew i would end up at this point. I tried hoing into nature, making music, being involved in sports , chnaging jobs, learning new things etc. But at the end i somehow end at in my car outside of my place feeling nothing at all and just thinking. I have this strange idea of just restarting everything. Almost like im done with this and i need to get out.

Im planning to donate part of my savings and leave the rest to my family. I will also write a letter explaning it to them. Also I will probably do it in an instant way. 

I didmt wrote this to seek attention or anything in that sense. But just to share how I feel."
1221,It's hopeless,I will try it today. Fuck it. I'm done. I don't want to be alive anymore. I will gain enough courage to try it. I will practice until I find the right way.
1222,My life is a dead end and I just want out before it gets worse. I'm tired of being worthless,"I'm young and supposed to be figuring everything out, but I don't know where to start. I can't get a basic entry level retail job no matter how hard I try. I've never had a job before, though it isn't for lack of trying. I have no idea where I want my career to go, I'm constantly exhausted, I'm wasting space like a loser having my parents pay for college but I have no idea what I want to major in or what I want to do with my life. People say that I'm lucky to have survived my ""traumatic years"", and I am lucky - but what do I do now? I didn't plan any of this. This is honestly almost worse, because at least back then I had a goal: stay alive. Now I wish I had died. It seems like everyone else my age has at least an idea of what they want to do. They had time in high school to figure out what they're passionate about. They had time for part time jobs and volunteer activities. Must be nice. The only thing I actually care about is writing, but I haven't been able to write anything substantial in years. Everything I make just sucks. 

What the fuck happened to me? I used to be so happy and full of life when I was a kid. I used to write stories all the time. Now I'm lucky if I finish a basic concept outline. Seriously, what happened to me? I used to be a straight A student who had tons of friends, and now I'm an ugly, jobless, friendless loser who sucks at everything. I still get straight A's, but who gives a shit when I can't apply them to anything? I'm good at academics because I don't need to think or feel to write a research paper, I just do what I'm told. It's automatic. I can't remember the last time I felt excited or that I had a purpose. 

No career field appeals to me, everything is just boring. I'm far from lazy - in fact, I actually enjoy doing work because it's a distraction - it's just that I can't seem to shake the overwhelming pointlessness of everything. I don't understand why I still feel this way. I thought I was supposed to be happy now? I'm definitely not happy. Everything seems like it should be fine on the outside, so why do I still feel so terrible and worthless? I've never told anyone how bad it gets before, but I truly believe I would be better off dead. One less parasite taking up space. I have absolutely nothing positive to contribute to this world and I'm so tired of being stagnant while everyone else is growing up. I can't, for the life of me, imagine a future for myself. Even if I were to hypothetically fantasize about ""my dream life"", nothing comes up. I can't think of anything I actually want that would be emotionally fulfilling. Everything seems so fake. The only thing that might help is a job, which I've been applying for often, but still... no one wants to hire a loser with no work experience regardless of how professionally I present myself. This is embarrassingly pathetic and I'm tired of feeling this way. And as I understand it, it only gets worse with age. I might as well just check out now and save myself the emotional turmoil of fully comprehending how useless I really am."
1223,I want to commit suicide on Xmas Eve just like my sibling,"My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. 

Thanks, Reddit."
1224,I've chosen a day,"I'm going to die on 31st July 2020. Thata enough time to get my credit cards paid off so my parents don't get left with my debts, and to try and make things right with people I've done wrong.

1228,A daily occurrence Getting worse?,"Here I am again, another failed attempt.

I'm starting to become numb to it all.  My illnesses have increased 20 fold.  I'm so scared of dentists I ran from one.  Not just got up and quickly walked to the door.  Bolted, out the door some things still attached.

My OCD has me gagging at the single thought that if you have a cat, I'll feel much more comfortable with shoes on, knowing they step in their own feces and urine covered rocks that can't be sanitary to your carpets.  Just an example I still love em.

My anxiety has me afraid to answer the door even food I was expecting, afraid of doctor's, nurses, especially police.  I'm afraid to eat or drink at times and it's growing worse by the day. 

I even found myself talking to someone who wasn't there and immediately reminded me of the schizophrenia simulation.  I'm afraid that's what it's turning into and I'm truly scared and don't know where to turn.  

Mostly I just want to feel safe so I can start my upcoming job but in another post I described how my friend I paid rent to has also done a 180 on me, and made me even more scared.  I'm still shaking 2 days later.  I just want a safe place to be.

I don't know where to turn or run to anymore.  Any advice?"
1229,"I want to die, but not really","I don't have a compelling reason. I just get tired of feeling this. I know my family and few friends love me, and imagining what they would be through when I'm gone makes me sad. I don't deserve their love, but maybe I want to give them what they deserve. 

Maybe, after 2 years I would stop wanting to die. Maybe 2 years of enduring my suicidal thoughts is worth it, compared to the lifetime of pain my loved ones would have if I disappear."

I’m extremely involved in my school, MC’d for prom, and am often involved in choir competitions and other school curriculums. 

I’m active in my community, and have a pretty good rep around my peers. 

Which makes it all the more difficult to express any thoughts regarding the act of ending my life with any close family members and friends in fear of worrying them. I tend to keep my thoughts to myself, and it is only when I get into another explosive row with my dad that I start crumbling and expressing my thoughts to my friends via messages. 

Last Friday, I got into another particularly explosive and heated argument with my father in public. I would not like to divulge further, but he essentially told me to shut up because I looked like an idiot and threatened to leave me there in the bookstore by myself and taking my brother with him. 

I had to walk around for a bit, and a security guard had to ask me if I was alright because I was crying so, so harshly. 

And I just felt so... pathetic and humiliated. 

And it was the first time, in such a long long time, that I thought how freeing it would mean for me to just end it all. To just escape the endless arguments and fits that my dad loves to throw, and be in a place of eternal peace. 

‘But I find myself so, so unwilling.’

‘I don’t want to leave anyone grieving’

‘I don’t want to risk financial instability for my family with my death’

‘I don’t want to burden my mother, who’s working hard for me and my family in another country’

This also wouldn’t be the first time I got into an argument with my father that ended in me a sobbing, heaving mess. 

And every time, it would always me MY fault—because I’m the immature one, I’m the one who’s not LISTENING. 

He’s the right one of course—because he’s my father, and he’s only disciplining me, and shaping me into a better person. It’s normal. It’s FINE. 

Tell me, is it normal to be told to rot in hell because your attitude is not what your father thought it would be?  Is it normal for your dad to tell you, to your face, that he only wanted to BREAK you because your attitude was getting too much? 

These are only a few examples of his harsh words to me, but the most vivid one, by far, was when he told me a demon was possessing my body because what else would explain my horrible attitude? What else could explain why I was such a horrible, horrible child. 

I was ten. TEN. 

And he told me he couldn’t go to jail for it because why would he? He never harmed me physically, never hurt me in ways that could break the law. 


And I’m just so, so tired. 


I want to rest. I want to sleep. 

I never have time for myself, and when I do, there’s this overwhelming feeling of guilt. 

I just want to close my eyes, and never wake up again. 

I planned to commit suicide at my late 20’s (at an age where no one would care much about me, where I would be free to make my own decisions) in a secluded area, where no one would find me, where I wouldn’t have to cause much grief. 

I would give my loved ones letters, and tell them how happy I am right now. How free I feel. 

It’s a selfish thought, I know. A fantasy, really. 

But one could dream right? 

I just want to rest."
1233,This sucks,"It’s Winter break, all of my friends have left, and now I’m here alone in a town with nothing to do and no way to go anywhere. My friends asked me what I was going to do over break and the three things I could come up with were see the new star wars, get a tattoo, and kill myself."
1235,Can’t do anything right,"Recently my mother had medical emergency that makes her pretty much disabled.Im basically her full time care taker I cook for her, empty her potty, wipe her poop, and do her laundry.Recently she’s been making statements that basically makes it seem like I want her to die or that I don’t care about her.Which is far from the truth because  I love my mom.Her words are vulgar and they hurt me really bad to the point where I cry. I have thought about suicide multiple times.Im beyond depressed because it’s my freshman year of college and I have no friends and I’m not doing so well academically on top of that Im flat broke. I understand that my mom is going through a lot I just wished she would see my of things and understand that I have a lot of stress too.Thanks for listening."
1236,i can’t handle living anymore,"i can’t take it. i really fucking can’t take it. im sick of going through the same cycle of pain and sadness. i can’t get any sleep. i don’t eat. i don’t do basic hygiene. friday, i’ll leave this world. i should’ve done it a lot sooner. so, these are my last few days. it feels kind of weird, knowing that i have a set death date. it’s going to be my last time seeing a lot of the things i would always see, yknow? i really don’t want to die. i want to be happy. but i just can’t keep living. i can’t be happy. it’s impossible. so, goodbye."
1237,Please murder me no one would give a fuck kill me right now since y’all fucking stupid lame ass troll ass worthless ass fuck boys wanna 🧢itlizlize off of someone’s exrutiating pain and it’s,"
Hilarious fuck you kill you self and kill me fuck you"
1238,Can I have someone to talk to? I’m getting closer to my demise. I think I’m settling with the ultimate choice.,"We can both share what’s going on. I’ll give you my Snapchat or maybe my number. I think ...I’m ... You see I shouldn’t have problems. I’m an attractive 19 yr old girl (I hear it from friends, family, strangers) I’m not super popular but I’m right up there. I’m in college. I have a money source. Id say I’m intelligent but I want to stay humble. A decent future..well I don’t want that future. I could be talking to someone I know about this... I’ve done some research..Wrist slitting is too slow and painful. What if I buy a gun? I think that’s what I’m leaning towards. Probably aiming at the heart since the brains are messy....God, I’m not suffering from trauma like other people so it’s kind of like a joke; my inner pain. My self hatred. I don’t have outer problems it’s all in my mind. I’ve tried reaching to my parents. I got on lexapro a month ago. It’s helped a bit. Now I bathe properly, and get up to go to work. I don’t cry when I wake up infact I don’t think I’ve cried other than thanksgiving when my mother said she’s done giving me advice. 

A little bit about me: I wish my mom was a mom and not a wallet....not someone who manipulated me all my life. I’ve finally woken up from my fantasy of being a kid (I’ve been depressed since middle school)...I’m finally not putting up with her lies. I’m no longer a pon. I’m the queen of my own chessboard now. Except this queen is eager to sacrifice herself. Eager to be put into checkmate. I’m thinking of transferring to uni in Chicago.. but if I do I’ll have to take out loans. I can’t tell if this is my mom trying to keep me here in state...I’ve considered becoming a stripper to pay the bills once it’s time. I’m working two high paying jobs this summer to have something when I go. If I go. I kind of just want to die. I’ve given into the social norms. I’ve quit my childish aspirations to produce music, (I’ve made many songs and oh I wish I was under different circumstances to upload them for people) and sing to people to make them happy because it’s not real. I’ll work for a corporate for 10 years, miserable. I was a bio major but it’s not what I want. So I’ve switched to marketing business as a sophomore currently so I can work in an office after I graduate. My greatest fear; the office jobs....

My future that I see...Work like a slave and eventually take the money I’ve put off on the side while living in a shitty apartment being cheap and saving up, to create an entertainment company like they do in South Korea except not treat the idols like slaves....the only thing I care about is music. I was controlled by the ones in charge thinking it was real to make it in the music industry. (The ones who target you making you think a certain way while listening to the artist’s music so you come running back giving them the money they’ve been seeking) I’ve finally been tamed. I’ve let go of my childhood. I’ll succumb to becoming an adult to pay my taxes and live quietly with a husband enjoying my earned vacations not worrying about being poor. I’ll get to retire early and travel.

F!#k that!!! I’d rather die than conform. I’m still here because I want to see if I can still have my one desire. If I can’t get it then I don’t want anything else. I’ve settled for mediocre because little did I know everything around me has been telling me to do that. It keeps my parents quiet and farther from disowning me. This place is all about money and power and if you don’t have atleast a mild form of that (any lifestyle where you aren’t living paycheck to paycheck; doesn’t matter) then your life is going to be hell or never as good as it could be. I feel like a conspiracy theorist at this point but I see it as I’ve woken up from being a kid and ngl I hate it and idk why everyone is ok with just existing and living mediocre lives like sheep.

Please someone write to me. Please talk with me. Any age idgaf. I’m alone in my head and I’m scaring myself. This is so desperate but I think I’m only going to see early 2020. I mean I’ve got to save up and work extra long so I can pay for the gun. They’re expensive."
1239,I'm a horrible person who has watched horrible pornography. I can't live with the guilt and shame anymore.,"Just to be clear, yes. That kind. 

I used to be so afraid growing up that I was an evil person who would someday commit evil deeds. I was raised in a very conservative church that preached constantly about hell, and I was terrified of it. I was terrified of losing the favor of God, my family and friends, of society on the whole. I was terrified of going to hell, and I hated God because I thought he was going to send people that I loved there. 

I'm not going to make any excuses. People have gone through what I've gone through in life, and they haven't become terrible people as a result. I just want to be normal. All I've ever wanted is to be normal. To not have such darkness in my head. But instead I allowed my feelings of evilness and of being unforgivable actually *make* me evil and unforgivable. 

I'm so, so sorry."
1240,im so tired of being gay. i didnt start feeling like this until 22. i want to be straight again.,
1241,There is no hope people,Let me go I dont wanna suffer anyone .. why everyone is so uptight about this things ??? Nothing can save me now no one care .. its either pity or feel bad for me .. I got no one to listen me ..
1242,Welp,"I could kill myself tonight (or atleast try to). Nothing is stopping me right now. It’s so tempting, but I doubt I will. Already have a date set so might as well keep going until then ig"
1243,Im too numb,"Im at a strange place in life at 18, where everything just feels pointless. We're all going to die anyways, right? So therefore we should live it up to the best... is what i was told. The thing is now that given my current situation, living it to the best requires an extreme amount of work and effort, one which probably exceeds my lifetime. The joy from living to my fullest potential doesnt outway the amount of pain and effort to reach it. After realizing this, my world just went colorless. Everything black and white. So now im at a crossroad where i can either go through hell and back for a little taste of heaven? Fuck no, not worth it at all. The other option is to rest peacefully, forever, without effort or pain. It just feels logical that i should just rest."
1244,what’s the likelihood i’ll die if i take all the pills i have?,would rather OD on some pain killers and be high before i die lol.. but don’t have any of those. have some prescription meds and a bunch of other pills and i imagine if i take at least 50 i should die right lol.. i’ll swallow all these bottles honestly even if i seize and have foaming at the mouth at least i’ll know it’ll end for good after
1245,Pills...,"If someone were to overdose, what would the best medication be to either put them in a coma or die. Would any over the counter medication work?"
1246,Help,Is there any drug or something I could take that would make me not be  afraid to kill myself ? I want to die but just cant do it for some reason and I really dont want to be alive anymore
1247,If I don't get a different job soon I will probably end it all by the years' end.,"The cost of living here is steadily increasing but my salary has been the same for the last 5 years. I recently had to move into a smaller apartment because I could no longer afford my rent, but it wasn't enough. The bills just keep piling up and it is mainly because I just can't find something better. I am working a dead-end job that I absolutely despise. To top it all of my hours have been cut almost in half since the seasons changed. I literally have my default tabs set to different job boards and spend most of my time applying to jobs that I am qualified for when I am not working. I am a constant burden on my friends and family and I hate myself for it. My family is full of narcissists and I know that if I ask for help they will hold it over my head for the rest of my life so I dread going to them. I hate myself even more for having to constantly inconvenience my friends when they have their own lives to worry about. It seems like everyone is more successful than me and they haven't even tried. I went to a good school, got a high GPA, and when I am at work I work like a maniac, but I just can't get ahead. I often get ""advice"" from people saying ""why don't you just take an unpaid internship to get more experience"" or ""why don't you hang out a shingle and go into business yourself"" If I had the funds to start my own business, I would have done it years ago, and an unpaid position can't pay for groceries and might actually cut into what few hours I have left at work. Something's gotta give, either I get a job, or I just end it all and be done with it. I'm tired of feeling like I am constantly drowning."
1248,A safe place,"This seems like the only safe place to post this. I've blessed in where way imaginable, I have food, heat, a bed, and people I associate with. But I feel like I'm burden. Suicide is constantly on my mind, I've fantasized about it for many years. Tonight, the cross is to heavy to carry and I've just to scared to pull the trigger. My gun is only a few feet away, but I could never do it. There is something wrong with my head, two types of medication didn't work. I want to be a lone. I hurt other people. I feel like my life is a curse. I want to join the military to serve others, yet know of I reach out for help, I'll be rejected. Eventually one day, it will happen. Maybe not tonight. But one day. No matter how good life gets, my heart gets to heavy to cope and i. Just. Can't. I want to die. As I post this I'm on drugs and alcohol. I drink to excess and take narcotics, yet always wake up. Just pray for me. Pray for me to be in heaven, soon. I don't want my life anymore"
1249,So tired,"Do you think there's a point of no return? Like, at some point, you can't come back from the depression, you're too far gone. I feel like that's happened to me. I've been sad for so fucking long, but lately I'm more numb than usual, more determined, if that makes sense. I can't stop thinking about killing myself, I think about it every day. In September I overdosed. I walked around on the streets downtown all night, hallucinating, seeing and hearing my mom and stepdad everywhere, until the people I was seeing came closer and I realized they were strangers. I haven't talked to mom about it since it happened. It was a horrifying night. I was twitching and shaking and couldn't breathe properly. I'm sorry, I just need to talk about it, I know it's unnecessary but I do. I know I should talk to mom about it. But the thought makes me feel sick, it feels wrong and she'd be sad. Or maybe she would be annoyed. My best friend randomly stopped calling a while ago. We usually hang out a lot, so I don't understand why he's suddenly not calling to come hang out anymore. I know somewhere in my mind there's probably a good reason, he's busy or tired or hanging out with other friends, he can't spend all his time on me. But a part of me is scared. What if I've upset him? What if he finally figured out that I'm a shitty friend and this is his way of letting me down gently? I'm sorry, this dumb rant is all over the place, I'm really sorry for not making sense. I'm not sure what I thought posting here would accomplish. I don't know."
1250,I hate people,Literally cannot make the fact that I’m suicidal any more obvious to my parents. Either they are incredibly oblivious or just don’t care. Probably both
1251,It’s so calming to have a date set,"I don’t know why but it’s refreshing to think that I might be dead soon. 
I probably won’t even do it. Il get scared. But it’s still nice to think about."
1252,What if..,What if I just drive to the beach and let the waves take me... what if I drive to the mountains and fall off a height... what if I die tonight...
1253,How would I go about telling my fiancees that I want to commit WWII Japanese fighter pilot but without the plane or any other victims?,"I know I used a comical euphemism, but I'm being serious.

***I am not at risk right now, but the thoughts are becoming increasingly frequent.***

2 years ago today (December 14th), I lost my closest friend. We attempted suicide together, and had gone into comatose. When I had woken up, I had found that he did not make it. That just as I woke up, he flatlined ( r/nevertellmetheodds ).

I'm now engaged to two people (the Netherlands permits polygamy from migrants if the marriage was done in a country where polygamy is legal, which is where we are moving after we get married probably somewhere in Africa but thats not the point), and they both know about my friend and today and the 16th (when I woke up and he passed). How do I tell my partners that I want to commit Hiroshima Victim on myself and what can I ask them to do to keep me motivated?"
1254,Evil spirits tonight?,"Everyone seems so much worse tonight than usual.  I’m starting to believe in evil spirits or something.  Ideas as to why?  I know finals, darkness of winter, but wow....so many sad and empty souls."
1255,Waiting until my cat dies,"She's only 4 years old and healthy, so I have awhile. I planned to do it a few weeks ago but i remembered my cat. I can't write her a note and she wouldn't understand. Atleast now I have a lot of time to plan it. I'll make it through this hell for my little baby, atleast until she dies. When she dies I'm either going to hang myself or jump off a big building."
1256,I'm visiting my suicide site tomorrow!,"My parents have this very small extra apartment with a small bathroom that I decided will be my final location. I'm borrowing keys for it under the pretense that I'm gonna check on the bills and mail but really, I'm surveying the bathroom. On my way there, I'm gonna buy duct tape, plastic wrapping, rubber, etc to plan out how to make it airtight for my charcoal suicide. I am excited and nervous as fuck, I don't know if I'm gonna chicken out again but at least this is a first step to what I want. I really hope a few weeks (or couple of months, depending on how long I'll chicken out), I'll be successful.


I'm fairly sure about the process but if you have extra tips on how to make it more foolproof, hit me up!"
1257,Well later guys much move to all as I know a lot of you are people trying to help others,I've given up I'll see you all on the other side if there is one. Hopefully if everything goes to plan this time tomorrow I'll be dead from co2 poisoning I appreciate all the sympathy I got from you all means a lot  but nothing will change this and  world and how i see it so i love you all take care and goodnight.✌
1258,I hate myself,"I hate everything about me. I’m so fucked mentally. I’m just a fat, ugly, stupid loser with a drug problem. I’ve felt this way since I was 14, just over 3 years ago. I recently lost 50 pounds and quit heroin and the girls have been telling me I’m beutiful and the guys have been telling me that I’m fun to be around, but its so hard for me to believe them. No matter what people say to me, at the end of the day I’m still not happy with myself, which sucks because I figured that when I surround myself with people that love me I’d be more happy but that was fucking false. Every single thing that was said to me years ago still sticks with me, and I still feel like the same person. I’ve come to realize that no matter how many people say they love me I’m still gonna feel empty, and I’m still going to veiw myself as worthless. I have no confidence in my ability to move on and make a better life for myself, I feel like I peaked a little bit ago and I’m just going downhill from there. Might as well go out while I still have something good, better than hitting rock bottom for like the third fucking time. I’m supposed to ship for boot camp in 30 days, I have a good job waiting for me, but I know when I leave my town I’m just going to go back to being lonely, so whats really the point. I’m either gonna stay in my hometown and continue with my meaningless relationships to keep me sane until everyone moves on, or I’m going to leave and be a loner for the reat of my life. I don’t know how I even have friends or a girlfriend, I’m so socially retarded, and I doubt I’m going to be this lucky in a different town. This is the best it gets, and I dont want to be around to see the life I built for myself go to shit."
1259,the cavalry's not coming and it's time for me to clock out,"every time i think about going through with it i've always had something to stop me. i was ready to kill myself at 18 and convinced myself to at least make it through college to see what the world had to offer. i'm 21 now and almost graduated and through every serious suicidal moment, something has happened or i have reached some sort of realization that gave me enough strength to go on a little longer. i've had my mind made up for weeks now and the cavalry is not coming.

i don't see any future for myself that ends well. it's not unlikely that i can find happiness eventually, but the time and pain it would take to get there is too much for me to bear.

tomorrow night i am going to see some of my friends at a group gathering. not to be dramatic, but it has been a very long time since other people have helped me feel peace. i no longer feel the warmth in my heart that i used to feel being around the people i love. i seriously doubt this will be any different. so tomorrow night i am saying my goodbyes. it will be hard but these people used to bring me so much comfort that i owe them something positive on my way out.

there is a gun store within walking distance and i live in a state with few gun laws. it will take no more than an hour to walk in, sign the forms, and walk out. there is a park nearby, where i will call 911 before doing it so that the police can find me instead of my roommate. 

i am going to leave a lot of pain behind. a lot of people are going to be hurt and my sister may never recover. i wish i knew what to say to these people. my friends may hurt for some time but after a while of my absence they will move on because life goes on. i cannot suffer for their peace anymore"
1260,The same thing,"I feel pretty alone tonight. I’m texting this in an empty parking lot in the pouring rain in my car.

I feel like no matter what I do is hurt people and maybe that I’m meant to be alone. I can’t seem to grasp simple things or am able to have an understanding of how to listen to people. I’ve tried therapy and tried to become a better listener and a better person but it seems that I always come back to this. Despite going to therapy to become a better listener, I’ve also went for depression and anxiety and it just feels like I run through the same cycle. Even now I feel like driving on black ice and maybe flipping in my car, or wishing that a few weeks back that I would’ve hit that deer head on. I just want to disappear. But even then I feel like I’m being “too dramatic”. I tried expressing my thoughts on suicide and cutting myself but it resulted in someone getting drunk about it and it makes me feel worse. I can’t tell people how they hurt me because I’m a coward. Or I feel like I make it about me when I do. I just wish I could have more courage. Be more independent, but maybe I’m just not meant to have that. Sometimes I wish I could remove myself entirely out of people’s lives and really want to. Some days I just want to fuck up everything I have just so I can suffer like I’m meant to. Some days I just want to make myself sick and starve myself and cut myself because I don’t deserve that care. Some days I wish I would’ve never responded to your message for some reason and saved you a lot of heartache and pain. I don’t know why you’ve been with me as long as you have or if you’re even okay because you won’t respond to me because you can’t believe me anymore. This is exactly, exactly why I told you that I’m annoying. Because I’m too dependent on you. You claim I’ve never cared. Why. Why couldn’t you just be patient with me like I have been with your anger. Why am I your emotional punching bag. Why do you get mad when I ask if you’re okay too often and tell me I pry into you. Why, how can I listen to you if you honestly don’t let me. I wish I could go back and given you more attention that day but I was too busy talking about some stupid shit about my hair instead of complementing how good you looked for losing weight and doing better for your health. I don’t understand where I went wrong but I truly hate myself for it. You shouldn’t be the one hating yourself because I’m the one who should be. I hope wherever you are tonight that you’re safe, and that you are just at home in bed at your apartment with your dogs. I kinda hope you just ghost me but I still have some way of knowing that things are better without me in the picture. I’m sorry. I hope someday you find love again, and most importantly that it’s in yourself"
1261,I’m supposed to get married in a month but I want to die before then.,"I had a miscarriage one month ago. We planned my wedding around me being pregnant for it. I don’t even think thats what is making me feel this way. It’s just one of the many things that makes me hate living. I’m laying next to my fiancé right now, who is perfect. But I’m just not happy. Nothing is enjoyable. I get so mad over the smallest things. I wake up alone and lay in bed every morning wondering why I should even get up. I know my fiancé resents me for not being better, why I can’t stick to a diet, why I can’t change when I say I will. I want to die so he can find someone better. Someone who he doesn’t have to lie to over stupid shit. Someone whose happy to be laying next to him. I don’t deserve to live. Why live if I can’t be happy? I see all these posts on here on how lonely and sad they are. But I’m not lonely so why am I so sad all the time?"
1262,I really fucked up,I was venting to my friend and they now know that ive had thoughts of hurting others in the past and theyre not responding I hate myself I dont know what to do jesus Christ someone calm me down I'm having an attack please fucking help me i beg of you
1263,The end,I don't know why i feel like this but cutting doesn't help any more
1264,I wish I had someone else to turn to.,"No therapist will respond to my inquiries. My fiancé’s mom is in ICU in another state, and I’m so alone. I can’t ask him for help because he has so much to deal with. He went to get drunk with family mere blocks from where his ex lives and I’m too insecure to deal with it. I don’t know that I’ll make it through the night. If anyone has any insight, I’d appreciate it. However, this is a heavy subject, and I don’t actually expect a response. I’m sorry for bothering you, but thank you for taking the time to read. I’m so alone. I love you all, and I truly hope you never have to feel this way. I’m sorry, Dillon. I love you."
1265,Everything's falling apart.,"I cant anymore. Everything I knew is crumbling into my hands, and I cant fucking deal with it anymore. This is hopefully my last post before I end it on Monday. I just hope that my family understands. Today, I realised that my friends wouldnt even care if I did it. Everything I've ever told myself turned out to be true, and I'm going to get relief."
1266,I can't sleep and I'm miserable as usual.,"ften times when I can't sleep I just wish I had somebody in bad with me. Somebody I could just watch as they look so peaceful and innocent as they sleep. To listen to their breathing, maybe even playing my ear to their chest to hear their heartbeat and whatnot just to know I'm not alone. Someone who I can lay next to and watch YouTube as my insomnia gets the best of me, holding their hand as they slept soundly beside me. Who am I kidding, I do it every time I can't sleep. I just want to have somebody beside me during the tough times. I've been so stressed out lately that my eyes and other muscles in my body have been consistently twitching. I've been working my ass off to get people Christmas gifts, people that I doubt would even appreciate them anyways, but I want to be nice and show the few people in my life that I appreciate them even if the feeling isn't reciprocated. Every paycheck I get this month is going to Christmas. I might as well just take a goddamn lighter to my paychecks. It'd warrant similar results anyways. Christmas is such a goddamn stupid time of year. But I'll make a separate post about that tomorrow. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I'm really getting sick of it. Nothing I do feels worth it anymore. I don't feel loved. I don't feel appreciated. I don't feel like I'm needed. I feel like I could vanish right now and not a single ripple would occur in the world. I just wish somebody loved me in that special way that most people get to experience. I don't know. This was just a dumb rant that probably won't get much attention anyways, so I'm gonna try and get sleep. I'm sure it'll be in vain anyways, but what else am I gonna do? Cheers."
1267,Heartbroken,"I am absolutely devastated. I work very, very hard, every day. If I’m not working overtime at my full time job, I’m being a mom, to two boys, one with special needs. I have 6 pets that I love dearly, but am more aware now I keep trying to fill the void. 
I work all the time and I have no money. I miss my kids (my mom takes them to school and picks them up). Days like today I was at work from 6am to 10pm and had an hour commute each way. 
I bought my bf lunch and dinner while I was at work, when I barely had time to eat. I asked for help feeding the animals since I wasn’t going to be home in time. I have very clear instructions (I’m always the one to feed, so I would have to spell it out for others). I got in my car to come home, and was delayed cuz my wipers broke. Someone stole my ice scraper out of my car, so I had to wait for it to defrost enough to scrape the ice with a stick. I asked my bf if he could please buy new wipers for me on his way to work tomorrow (I of course would Venmo money to him).  But it ended up being such an inconvenience that I stopped on my way home at Walmart (and accidentally bought the wrong ones anyway).
I hate my life. I hate everything about my life. I have had a lot of loved ones kill themselves, and I would never want to transfer that pain into my children. But my heart hurts so bad. I’m so hopeless. I literally have nothing to show for my life except for my two boys, who are struggling, and I can’t help them. 
If I got in an accident and died tomorrow, I wouldn’t be upset. I would be devastated for my kids, but to the rest of the adult world, I am replaceable."
1268,"Out of e everything I had to deal with growing up; my alcoholic, abusive father. My mother having no desire to raise me once I moved in at 13 to escape my father.","Everything they did to me. Out of all of it, the only thing I cannot forgive, the only thing I am still blindingly angry about is the fact that they even gave me life to begin with. 

Why did they bring me into a world that is just never ending struggle, and suffering and pain."
1269,The feelings are so strong,Drinking doesnt even help anymore just praying I get through this.
1270,I just want to end everything,"I want to die so fucking bad. If I stay alive I’ll just turn into a worthless wageslave with no one to come home to die to my ugly, subhuman appearance. I just want to hang myself so badly"
1271,Dream Suicide Vacation,"I've always been a bit honest &amp; naive &amp; dont really like to lie. But I am.
I promised myself things would be better once I saved up money, got a license, got a car, &amp; used it to move out of my abusive situation.
Things are still so awful.
I've been planning a trip to favorite place in the world. It's a beautiful beach. I'll visit with some friends, &amp; then later in the week I'll end it on the beach.
I've requested the time off work, figured out how to obtain a gun legally once I'm there. I'm about to buy the ticket &amp; I'm nervous.
I feel like once I do theres no going back. No one can stop me this time.
No one has a clue that the goal of this trip is a brief vacation which will end in my suicide. Not my friend who I'll stay with, my therapist, my psychiatrist...
I'm trying to tie up all my lose ends, I've been planning this for about 5 months but time has flown. I've only got a few weeks before it's all over.

Anyone else got something similar planned?"
1272,Goodbye.,I'm done posting on throwaway accounts. This is it. Goodbye.
1273,Final Words,"Guess this is a goodbye. Im tired of what life has become, bad treatments from my family and friends. Being left on the side, only being a side character on everyones lives around me. Never having a girlfriend, losing my only 2 friends slowly due to my depression. Not being able to do anything. Having bad grades at uni, and struggling to keep it together to continue. My abussive Nparents and Nbrother can go fuck off. I just drank multiple sleeping pills hoping to just die during my sleep.

Goodbye"
1274,I don't have a reason... I just want to do it,
1275,Why are these thoughts so much more persistent at night?,"...is it just the sense of most of the city shutting down, most people are going to sleep, and me being awake with nothing but these depressive thoughts to keep me company?

Or is there something about the darkness of night that encourages the darker part of my mind to take hold"
1276,I go to sleep every night thinking of drinking rat poison,"I've even become immune to what my family and fiance will feel. My family will slowly get over it. My sister might find it difficult to deal with it, but who will miss me past a year, tops?

Pretty sure my fiance will find someone new and move on.

People at work won't care. I'm mostly dumb and invisible anyway. In fact they might even laugh about what a waste of a life I am. It's sad because it was a job in my dream area. But I sucked at it.

I am tired of being this extremely dumb, physically defective, absolute failure with a lack of cognitive function and creative ability. I wish I could die in my sleep. The world needs smart people and I'm just a waste of space."
1277,I just wish I could go,"I fucking hate this. It makes me sick. Every waking moment I feel nauseated by this painful limbo where I can't really live and I can't really die. I've seriously considered suicide for as long as I can remember, honestly even well back into my childhood, but it's always something I kept to myself. Although I came close many times, I never went through with it, because it felt so selfish to leave behind my family. They've hurt me a lot but I still care about them, and I couldn't bring myself to abandon them: And I kept telling myself-- things will get better. They only get worse. Worse and worse, beyond anything I could have ever imagined the first time I toed the edge of a high drop off, wondering if I should just lean forward and let go of everything. The only one I ever really opened up to about it was my recently ex-boyfriend, we were together for a year and a half and we promised each other all sorts of stupid things--that we'd marry, that we'd have kids and be together forever, that if anything ever happened to the other, we'd die together. He was my first real love and I fucked it up. I wasn't strong enough to do it and now the relationship is broken forever. I was in a really rough place today, rougher than I've ever been, to the point where I was willing to leave everyone behind, as selfish as I can't help but feel that it is, and my ex, he calls me up and tells me that even though I broke every other promise we made, that he'd keep the last one. That I had better not kill myself because if I did, he'd do the same, I'd be killing him too. I can't even begin to explain to anyone else feeling angry about this, indignant that I can't kill myself. It sounds batshit insane. But don't have a right to leave? Why are we as a society so insistent on forcing people to be here that don't want to be here?? As if it's some heroic thing, as if we're saving them and their pain will magically disappear, that they'll want to be here. I feel trapped. As much as I want to die, I can't die knowing that I'll be responsible for his death too. I have all of this pain and it gets worse and worse everyday but I can't do anything with it. I can't go, but I can't really live either. I can't even remember the last time that I felt genuinely happy. I just wish I could go without hurting anyone and without having his death on my hands but I can't even fucking do that."
1278,"I’m just completely fed up with the way I’m living. There doesn’t seem to be any hope wherever I turn. People reaching out is all artificial and temporary, but ultimately, my life is complete shit. Really considering just killing myself",
1279,I'm a worthless NEET who is better off dead.,"I just turned 23 and it's making me feel like shit. I haven't had a job in nearly 3 years and I've become a pathetic NEET. It's crazy that just a few years ago I had a job and friends. Now when I look back I don't even know who that is anymore. Since then I have become depressed, filled with anxiety, and fat. I am ashamed and afraid to go outside. I'm afraid to see everyone I used to know. I can't imagine what they would think. They have gotten married and are having kids while I'm a fucking fat loser with no job. I have hit rock bottom. Being a NEET is it's like your stuck in a time capsule. Everyone is moving on while you're stuck in time. I feel like I have no memories. I know I need to fix myself but its hard. Sometimes I think its better if I just end it. I feel like I fucked up so bad."
1280,why can't i just leave,"They say that suicidal people don't want to die, they just want the pain to stop. That's a fucking lie. I want to die. The world is a cruel place and bad people win all the time. Humans are inherently greedy and selfish. Even so-called good people hurt you. I feel nothing."
1281,I know I need help but there's no way to get any. I want to give up. I want it to end.,"The title says it all, really. I've tried to kill myself twice, once a little over a month ago and then again yesterday. I need to do something about it but I don't know how or what. I've told my mom that I want to kill myself and she just said she was here for me, but super dismissively. So she knows I'm suicidal but she won't do anything about it. I've told one of my friends about everything and he said I should tell my parents, well I've tried that. I have three options: 

1. Tell my parents again. There's absolutely no way this could go well, they just refuse to believe me.

2. Tell someone at my school. I already know my school is useless. I've tried to get help from them before and they didn't do anything.

3. Just wait it out. This is a terrible idea. I know things will only get worse.

Well, there's always option four, I suppose. I could always just give up. Kill myself. I've learned from my mistakes, I know exactly what I did wrong. It would be easy to just end it.

Someone please help me, I'm not ready to die. I don't know what to do. How do I get help? I'm running out of options and I'm scared."
1282,I'm going to give myself until August 2023,Then I'm gonna blow my brains out. I've always talked (not publicly) and thought about killing myself. I guess with Christmas and 2020 well on its way I think I should get serious about this. I'm actually pretty excited.
1283,Whats wrong with me?,"So... hi. Ive made posts here in the past when ive been feeling down and suicidal. It... strangely helped me. Just to have a place to post, to vent and not be judged or anything.

Since my last post, things have been better. I got a job... that isnt the best but it lets me afford my apartment. I just... need to manage my money better going forward.

I've got friends. I have people that truly care about me but i still feel so... lonely. Im not sure why though. I keep having to remind myself that i am cared for, i am acknowledged and i should feel better and be happier but... im not. I still feel the urge to die, i still feel the pull and the thoughts still creep into my mind. I still look at passing vehicles on my walk to work and think ""I could just jump in front of it and die maybe."" And...

Why??

Maybe its something else. 
The lonliness that doesnt go away? My own self esteen and self loathing? I dont know and... i dont know who to ask or tell. I dont have anyone im THAT close enough to talk to about this stuff with anymore since my mom died and i basically separated myself from my family entirely. Hell, im not even sure if what im posting is even allowed here at all but... i dont know, maybe i just want a place to vent. Get my voice heard... see if anyone else has any ideas, suggestions. 

Its strange to say i feel better but at the same time I... feel kind of the same as i used to? If that makes sense? I dont know, i rambled. Ill end it here."
1284,Can anyone just talk with me?,"Can anyone just talk with me, I just wanna tell someone about all my shit"
1285,Dying to be me,"Since I apparently can't die, even when I'm just dreaming about it, it makes me wonder what the point is in this useless, fake life.   You're supposed to care for people because you have the same blood or are  related by marriage.   Well actually I don't!  Also don't care about what my life means to others.   It's mine isn't it?   So if I want to throw it away, I should be able to without all these ridiculous constructs that society puts in the way."
1286,I tried fucking everything,I have 0 friends 0 accomplishments in life. I'm ready to kill myself
1287,I’m such a stupid loser I can’t even kill myself right,"God i just want this to be over nobody loves me I don’t have any family money friends talent I’m worthless I wish my father would’ve used a condom or some shit I’m in so much pain and I don’t have anywhere to turn I wish I had my a way to hire a hit man like I wanted to do I need to be  killed I’m stupid ugly talentless worthless nasty hateful evil everyone hates me I tried to be mindful
And be accountable I can’t win something to save my life PLEASE I WANT TO DIE PLEAsee I’m begging please kill me please"
1288,i’m actually terrified of myself right now.,"well, I don’t really know why i’m posting this. I guess because sharing it with the internet might stop me from doing it right now at least? apologies for this mess of a post, I can’t even think straight right now. 

I’ve wished I would just die for a while now, but I was always too scared to die or too scared it would be painful, whatever. but right now I am literally seeing myself picking up a knife and stabbing myself. It just keeps replaying in my head and the more I see it the more I feel like I have to do it. that’s probably like the worst way to do it, but it feels like i’m not in control of my brain or body. I’m scared I will pick up the knife and stab myself. this feeling is really scary and I don’t know what to do. the only thing that was preventing me from doing it is my dog. she already lost one person she loved and I don’t want that to happen to her again. I cant hurt her. 

but i’ve ruined my whole future, I have literally nothing going for me now. I always hope that one day I just won’t wake up, but I didn’t think I could ever do it myself. It just feels like I have no control and any second I might grab the knife and stab myself. I don’t think I want to, and i’m actually terrified to do it and terrified because I don’t know why this is happening right now."
1289,It's worse.,"I'm hurting even more.

I don't want most of the friends I have.

They try to be nice to me. I can't blame them for what they do. Oftentimes I consider if i'm being the asshole by even just thinking they could be doing bad to me, even on accident, and that maybe i'm just delusional.

But it's hurt so much now. I have terrible impulse control. I'm shitty at holding in any of my emotions or considering what I want to say even for a while. Call it being selfish, call it being weak - willed. I'm fucking abhorrent at restraining myself in any capacity.

I oftentimes do or say things that turn them against me. Maybe they're overreacting and want to feast on me like piranhas, or maybe, and this is what I feel so often, i'm just a piece of shit person they have to put up with because i've been with them too long.

But i'm so tired. I'm tired of having everything go nice, and then I fuck up, and then I get yelled at, and then I feel as if everything's ruined. I'm so tired of fucking up all of my friend groups with my bullshit.

But I can't find another friend group. I can't. No other group will take me. I'm too impulsive, too weak - nerved, too much of an impotent piece of shit, and think too little of myself to reasonably shove myself into a new group. Plus, they'd have to deal with all of my frequent breakdowns in a way that even my current friend group struggles with.

But I can't just leave. I'm desperate for social interaction. This is the only people i've had to talk to in over four fucking years. Being alone like I am does things to you, but being alone with nobody to talk to - Even people you don't want to be around - Fucks you up.

I so often consider what I could've done in the past to avoid getting up with this group, or even to steel myself so I could survive with no social interaction. Sometimes I wish I were a sociopath or had complete antisocial personality disorder just so I wouldn't feel this irregular fucking need to talk to someone, anyone.

I hate it so much. Why do I have to suffer like this?"
1290,I wished euthanasia was legal.,I'd be first in line to apply though i've heard it isn't easy to do so. Fuck being alive.
1291,I just want to die I keep getting played I keep getting blamed Ive been trying I don’t have any purpose im a waste of life I should’ve been killed when I was born,Someone please kill me please please I’m begging please
1292,it may not kill me but i want to take everything in my medicine box. i don’t know what to do anymore.,i’m just unable to help myself fully due to be ill and all my limitations and symptoms.. i have no car or money. no friends or family. i’m very sick right now and can’t even leave the house safely alone. my only hope right now is to find a stranger to live with while i’m applying for resources. shelters aren’t much of an option since you have to leave all day and i need a lot of rest and sometimes am bed bound on bad days. i don’t see any other options then to end all this cause i can’t see anything getting better
1293,"Days away from being homeless, but too sick to be on street","I dont have any fight left in me.
I'm too sick to work. 
Social security is not enough to live off of.
I cant leave the area I live in because I need access to the health care I get here.

I dont have the money to pay my rent past this Thursday.
I'm too sick for any of the homeless shelters. I've already tried, but I will die if I have to sleep on the streets again. 

I dont know what to do...
Someone help me find just a little hope."
1294,Up and down up and down same shit,"I don’t know why I can’t remain content for more than a week? Is it society’s pressure of this idea of constant happiness? My life hasn’t been the same the last two years. I try to make changes, but I end up in the same boat I started in. I’m stuck in time while everyone else has moved forward. I don’t see a solution but the permanent one at this time. I’ve never experienced this much pain in my life. I don’t see a point to anything as we all die anyway. Why stay and fight the inevitable? Sounds ridiculous but this is how my mind thinks."
1295,throw away account don't plan on staying,"I feel so alone in a world full of people. I just feel all alone and feel like I need something more intimate than superficial ""friendships"" I have but am always alone in everyones presence. I'm so tired of just being alone and can't put up with it much longer. Don't even care how shitty my life has been, its the fact I've been alone the whole time."
1296,no motivation left,"It’s currently finals season and I’ve already completed 3 out of 4. But I don’t even know if I can pass 2 of the courses. I used to have goals, like going to dental school but now I know I will never get there because of how shitty my grades are.

I can’t afford to fail 2 courses and I panic everyday waiting for my final grade to come out. I feel so unmotivated everyday, and just tired.

I’ve had a panic attack almost every night when I try to study because I don’t know how to do it. My parents don’t believe that my mental health is deteriorating, and they don’t believe that depression is real or serious. I don’t know how to get it through to them.

I dont have the money, and frankly just scared and anxious about seeing a psychiatrist. I don’t know why but I’m afraid of being judged more.

I’ve thought about suicide so many times but instead I just self harm. I don’t know what else to do. There are days where I feel like life is completely meaningless and since I’m gonna did anyways, why not sooner..."
1297,"""Suicide is a premanent solution to a temporary problem""","Fucking bullshit. Some of us HAVE permanent problems. And yes, suicide is the solution. I want to feel nothing. I want to be dead. I don't want to breathe anymore i don't want to be here anymore. 

""You'll miss out on so much""... like what exactly? Being alone? Working forever? Struggling every single day? No, a tv show is not going to cut it. It doesn't outweigh the need to kill myself. I don't care about not watching my favorite tv show. 

""People will miss you"". Even if they did, that's not my fucking problem. I'll be dead, i don't care or would even know what happens after. I can't have people missing me if i have no one. 

Fuck off with this stupid bullshit. I don't give a fuck about any of this. I don't care that you don't think my struggle is worth killing myself over. Fuck off."
1298,Haven’t felt like this in awhile,"Having the worst panic attack 
I hate my fat flubby body
I hate my ugly face
I feel so unwanted
I feel like the only time I’ll feel peace is when I’m dead"
1299,No one cares,"I've been telling EVERYONE I trust that I'm suicidal and EVERYONE has left. My boyfriend of 6 years just left, he was the only one I had left. I'm done. I'm done trying to survive in a world I don't want to be in if no one fucking cares."
1300,Just a question,If you’re going to commit suicide and want to fo it in the least painful way...call 911 first? Just wondering. I’ve caused enough pain.
1301,Started ending it,"A few months ago, I lost everything in an electrical fire. A week after that, I learned I have metastasized stage 2 thyroid cancer. Now, I can barely function, have no way of working and depend 100% on others. My last meal was three days ago.

Tonight I'm taking all the painkillers and sleeping pills I can. I'm crying my heart out as I'm typing this and swallowing more and more. I wish I could say this world had been nice to me... alas.

Good bye, shitty world. I hope you're better to others.

I just needed to vent one last time. 

Take care of yourselves and each other. It's important."
1302,I'm fat and ugly And i hate everyone,Can't get rid of all the bad memories of abuse from my family and bullies. I gained back all the weight i lost. Drugs fried my brain. My bf doesn't understand and we're in a long distance relationship so I'm alone. I'm so Angry i want to die
1303,Update...,"Awhile back I had posted about my drunkenly suicide attempt, well I no longer have the urge to do it everyday, I still have the thoughts though. I have managed to over come this because of my favorite video game. Now I am not saying it would work for everyone nor am I trying to sell it. The Video game is part of a game series. It is Dragon Age Inquisition I have played all the others but this one stood out the best. I wrote a letter to the creators of the game (BioWare) but haven't sent it. The reason this has given me the strength to carry on is because I want to see what happens next in the next Dragon Age game. I know this post is long enough as it is, but I would like to add the letter to this post...

Dear Bioware,

    I want to say thank you, your games have helped give me something to live for. I've hit a few hard patches over the past couple of years, I was injured during a track accident while trowing discus and had three different knee surgeries, and your games, most importantly the Dragon Age series has kept me going although Mass Effect has also helped. I get to do different things and be something that I really can't be in the real world. I have always been a fan of the Dragon Age series but I never played Dragon Age Inquisition until my sister got it for me, I finished it the other day and thought it to be one of your best story lines yet. I can't wait to see what happens next in Dragon Age's future. Because of the companions I was able to create a perfect world with many friends. My Inquisitor’s romance was Cassandra and I was very happy with how that came out, had my Hart broken over the betrayal of Solace, Varric and the Iron Bull gave me laughter.

Again, Thank You for making these games that have helped me get through tough times.

1304,i kinda just want to talk to someone that understands,i’m part of the soulless popular crowd at school so all everyone cares abt is their followers and how many boys like them. no one understands so i just wanna talk to someone around my age (16) that actually gets it and won’t give me shit like “depression makes you less hot”
1305,So sick of getting crossed and shit,"1) my friends are slowly disappearing
2) my best friend took one of the girls i liked
3) my other friend took the girl that rejected me and said shes lesbian
4) i have tried to reach out to my close friends but they just conveniently disappear whenever i need help most
I think i really want to kill myself but im not sure if i will because i love my family too much although i have gotton so close to doing it many times. I have recovered from anorexia and cutting and i honestly feel like im so done with hurting."
1306,What will happen if I get involuntarily committed with my job/living arrangements? What’s the difference if I go in willingly?,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this... I work a part time job at a restaurant. I’m currently looking for full time work in an administrative position. My life is falling to pieces, and has been for years, and I’ve become suicidal again recently. 

I want to get help. But my biggest fear right now is being locked up. I need to make rent. I don’t have any savings, because I used it to move here when I was suicidal back in July and needed to get out of where I used to live. My job currently requires 3 weeks advance notice of time off. 

I know if I decided to actually kill myself I’d do it right. I failed in July, but my options were limited. Ironically, moving to my current location has infinitely improved my chances of succeeding (different method) if I were to try again. But I don’t want to die. I want to be fixed. But I can’t lose my job. I can’t go for any long period of time without pay. I also don’t want to negatively affect anything when it comes to getting a new job. But I’m so trapped right now that suicide seems to be the only real option. I had a time and a place for this upcoming week even...but I may not go through with it just yet. 

You may have seen my last post here, where I detailed all the reasons why suicide was better than speaking up. And I believe every single one of those reasons. But...if someone could just for a moment honestly give me hope that I won’t lose everything if I seek help...because I can’t afford to lose everything and live. If I’m going to destroy my life, I’d rather die on the way out."
1307,I can't take another hit,"I've been pushed away my whole life, all throughout my school life kids and staff were cruel, I missed out on every milestone a kid could have and grew up afraid- I waited an hour after school everyday for a ride because I was too scared to walk the four minute walk home thinking from the start of the day to the end that is was the day they were gonna follow through with what they said and kill me because boys don't act like that in Texas. My family pushed me away because I was shameful. 
I started transitioning when I was 18, dropped out of college to work and pay for hormones, started dating, I was going to live like I wanted to. I got my first boyfriend shortly after, I was so desperate to be wanted and not pushed away, I ignored alot of red flags and it eventually got worse, and became constant abuse. It took my nine months but I finally walked away, it would be a few more months before I felt enough self worth to stay away. I remember feeling like that same scared kid I was in Highschool. I started sleeping with my TV and hall light on (I still do) it would be years before I stopped waking up every hour to scan my room and check the locks, and another two years before I'd even think about dating again. 
At 19 my hair started falling out, chunks and chunks of hair would come out during showers. I was freaking out! I'm only nineteen and I'm chalked full of hormones, trans women start GAINING hair after starting HRT. I spent all the money I had seeing doctors, getting blood work and eventually saved up enough for a scalp biopsy (OUCH) results were inconclusive and I was getting the same answers from diffrent doctors . ""This SHOULDN'T be happening"" and ""it will eventually resolve itself as long as you continue hormones"" (it just continued to progressively get worse)
At 20 - 22 (I recently turned 22 last month) was when I realised it never ""gets better"" I found out last year I wasn't the only person my ex was abusing, he was also abusing a younger family member of his. I was 18 when my 28 year old ex pursued me, he took every opportunity to assert his dominance, age and strength over me. He made sure to constantly tell me that I would never be good enough for a life long partner. I didn't know his family beyond a few pictures, videos ane brief conversations. There was nothing I could have done to bring it to light, I had absolutely no clue but even the thought that this may have been going on while he called me his girlfriend makes my heart ache for her. I knew he was a sick individual for what he did to me, and to have done what he did to that young girl, his own family only solidifies how depraved he is and my inability to see that depravity makes me hate myself. 
Last April approximately two years after my first relationship I ventured into dating again. He was persistent, sweet and what I thought was the closest thing to a gentleman I'd ever get. He talked to me morning and night, called me during my lunch break, held my hand, opened every door for me and always walked me to my porch. I thanked him profusely for every little thing, I know to most it's just common decency but I had never been shown that kinda kindness before. It was a complete 180° the first time he got me alone.  He forced himself on me, grabbed me so hard I was bruised for days, I told him no, that I didn't want to, I wasn't ready but he refused to let up I said ok after what felt like hours, it hurt so much. I held myself after it happened and as he laid next to me, panting he said ""your first time's supposed to be special, huh"". How low he must have seen me to think him forcing himself on me made me feel special. He drove me home and I cried myself to sleep that night. I continued to see him, I felt the need to ""make the best"" out of every situation because history told me things don't get better. I asked him not to leave bruises on my breasts and waist but to him my request to respect my body was a throw away suggestion, he stopped using condoms after the first time. I spoke up once and told him to use a condom, he said no, just no, like I asked him if he wanted coffee or something and just continued. I've never told anyone that before. It made me feel disgusting, just something to use. He dumped me a few days later. Obviously it was for the best but I'd be lying if I said it didn't sting. 
I felt rotted inside, what was wrong with me that these men sought me out.
Shortly after I was outed at my faith based job, coworkers stopped talking to me, managment became unbearable, I had no choice but to leave. I was left unemployed and completely ran through my 401k and my savings, I put a great strain on what little support I had.
Then came August (my last paragraph I swear) my hair loss was at an all time high, I went from progressive thinning to losing about two solid inches off my hair line on both temples. I made an appointment with my pcp and begged for a prescription. She wrote me one and after a brief battle with my insurance I picked it up. After three weeks I began breaking out, boil like bumps under my skin, closed comedones and run of the mill pimples on my cheek and temple. I thought I could wait it out but it became so painful. I returned a month later and was given a topical cream, after three months with no progress I made another appointment with a dermatologist I was prescribed an antibiotic lotion, a chemical exfoliant and a medicated wash. After three weeks of this new combination and still no progress I emailed my dermatologist and was given a prescription for a powerful oral antibiotic for a month. It been two weeks and I'm at an all time low, my acne blankets my face and my hair loss is steadily getting worse. I feel like this is just another reason that I'm pushed away. I tried talking about it with family, how this is severely affecting my self esteem, how I feel disgusting and depressed and they tell me to get over it. That I'm being ridiculous. Even at my most vulnerable I'm being pushed away. I've felt alone my whole life but to be constantly pushed away even in adulthood hurts tremendously. My whole life people have looked at me one of two ways, like they feel sorry for me, looking away when I meet they're glance or staring back at me, wanting me to know they're disgusted with me and they'd think I'd be better off dead. I can't help but see myself that same way now. I feel disgusted with myself. I have one more doctor I can try and see, maybe two more medications I can try- both of which are not covered on my insurance but I'm terrified. What if she won't see me ? What if the medication is like all the others? 
I just can't take it anymore, after every obstacle I remind myself what I've been through and how I overcame it but I don't think I can do that anymore. I can't be pushed away again, I can't be told to get over it. I'm scared and alone like I was in school , like I've been my whole life and I just don't see how I can do that for another year."
1308,Nothing,"I recently started taking anti depressants and it’s supposed to take a while until they actually start working since I’m on such a small dosage. But there is one problem with it. Not that it’s causing any side effects, but it’s changing my relationships within my family. My mom mostly. I’m really close to her and she is my greatest confidant, and ever since I started taking this anti depressant, I feel like she can’t even look at me anymore. She’s treating me like I’m a bomb that could go off if she does something wrong. I hate that this has happened. And it’s not helping with my contemplations of suicide because this is the most that I have thought about it in my life. And honestly, it feels like my mom would only be let down because she knew that I was too broken to fix once I started taking medications. I feel like there’s nothing keeping me here anymore. I don’t know what I should do because I don’t wanna cause guilt for anyone but living and seeing the pity in my moms eyes it so much more painful."
1309,I just want to go.,"I don't know how to fix myself anymore. I always thought I'd be able to think myself out of any situation. Turns out that isn't the case. I've been fucking up for too long now. I just want to go. If I lived somewhere easy to get a gun I would've emde it a long time ago, but now I'm judt scared of surviving an attempt. If this shit life is so scary I don't even want to think about living it with a disability. I just wish I could push a button and never been born."
1310,Death is for pussies,
1311,I just don’t want to live.,"I feel so incredibly numb but not sad. I’m bipolar and prone to depression but this feels different. I’m not sad just numb and tired. Feels like I’ve been working myself to the bone for years, and I’m so exhausted. When I’m driving home sometimes I just put my foot on the gas till i hit about 100 on a and go straight at this T intersection with a tree in the middle. It makes me feel something like a release knowing I can end myself. I truly don’t have much to live for, no kids a handful of friends and family and no love life. As it is now I’m taking up space in a place I don’t want to be. Death doesn’t scare me but the way my life’s playing out does. I’m just waiting until I have the courage to fly into that tree at the end of the road, maybe then I’ll feel something worthwhile. Maybe then I’ll feel free."
1312,I think I'm just incapable of love,"I don't think I'm a complete monster. I'm capable of doing and saying kind things, and I don't actively try to hurt people or make life worse, but I just don't think I can feel any kind of love for someone. I really only want people around to alleviate my boredom.

I just see the world in terms of transactions. If I want something from someone then I have to do or give something to them. If I want someone to spend time with me I have to make them feel as if I care or provide something for them. There is no selflessness in me, it's all give and take. Even when people do talk to me without me doing anything I just feel guilty for wasting their time because I know I don't actually care about them. 

If I think about the people closest to me dying I just think that I would be annoyed about having to find new entertainment. If I were completely heartless then maybe this would be fine, but I want that feeling of mutual love. I've seen it in media and heard people describe it, but I'm beginning to think more and more that love doesn't exist, and people just delude themselves into thinking that settling for someone who fulfills some selfish desire and keeps you from being lonely is all love is. I probably shouldn't exist. I just get more annoyed and bored as life goes on, and the desire to kill myself grows stronger. I always end up pussying out, and I'm sure I'll do the same next time, so maybe I shouldn't be here.

Every time I look for love I end up being disappointed in everyone I meet, and just turn my back on those who might speak to me. I think I deserve to die at this point. Let me find the courage to save people from myself, and bring this miserable story to its end."
1313,I turn 29 in a few hours and life isn't what I thought.,"Everyday is really painful (not physically but mentally), just breathing makes me tired and getting through the day is a real battle. people I grew up with all have lives (married, they have children, nice careers). I dont have any of that. I am single, I have a basic job that doesn't pay well, etc. I used to be smart and have potential but I was always shy and never pursued anything meaningful in life. I know I'm just a random woman on the internet but I wasted my whole life and dont want to do this anymore."
1314,"Did you ever get tired of considering about death and life, so you just want to stop thinking and act on it righ away?","I do. Sometimes i was so exhausted and thought: ""Well, why thinking so much? Better just do it right now"""
1315,Living is the hardest thing you will do in your life and you just wanna quit,"Step one is calm down, and get through it 
Step two is changing lives for the better 
Be strong and don’t just quit because you feel like life ain’t worth it, others think your life is, there is a solution to everything that isn’t Suicide and if you calm down you can think of one. JUST CALM DOWN!!!"
1316,Can i just die already?,
1317,I’m ready to go.,"I lost the love of my life. My brother and I just established that we don’t need to talk anymore. My work situation is abysmal and I have no desire to go back to school. My parents are gone and when they’re around, they reek of disappointment. My dog is dying. I have two close friends and they don’t get along. I am almost 6k in debt. 

I am ready to leave the world and all the negativity I have in it behind. The worst part is that I’m sure there wouldn’t be anybody to find my body. Nobody will come looking for me. 

I am ready to go. Heck, I’m excited to go."
1318,People are fucked up,"Period. However, not you, be strong"
1319,How do you hang yourself with a belt?,I can’t figure it out. Do you make a knot? Idk.
1320,The stress of finals literally makes me want to kill myself.....,
1321,Can I talk to someone,
1322,There's no reason why,"I've always been depressed, since i realised that God doesn't exist and we are just living our miserable lives and pretending that there's a meaning for all of this. I'm not saying that being an atheist made me depressed. In fact I don't wanna commit suicide, I just don't wanna live anymore, I can't feel the need, i can't love. I literally never loved anyone, I fell like I could lose my family and keep living my life as if nothing happened. Never happened anything meaningful in my life, I can't remember my past, I  don't have memories, it's almost like if lived the same day for 20 years. There's nothing inside of me and it's unbearable to keep living like this. To HP fans, I couldn't face Dementors cause I don't have a memorie good enough to conjuring my Patronum. I don't know if this makes sense, but this is not a suicide letter. The world is dying and this makes me sick, the one thing love the most is nature, and it's the way we treat it breaks my heart. I go to college and I have a job, so I don't have much time to be out side, this also makes me feel bad cause what i cannot do what I like the most because I'm busy being the person the society wants me to be. We are all sick and I feel sorry about that, the world is dying and we are too busy on our routine to realize that and do something to change it. It's too much that I can't deal with so it feels good to talk about it. Actually this is my first text in English and it's not what I expected but the what can I say, life sucks. Sorry about any mistakes I might have committed. I'm Brazilian by the way and I hate the president what makes my life a lot worse. 
See u next year (or maybe not)"
1323,"I got to the ER last month because I had suicidal thoughts, the doctor asked me to stop the drama and leave.","I don’t even now what to do with those thoughts even if I don’t wanna kill myself because there’s no good reasons for it.

* I just graduated in engineering
* I have a job that I like
* I’m independent
* I have friends who cares

However, it’s been 4 years that I get random seizures like episodes and I’m unable to get proper healthcare for it. Two month ago I broke my nose again but this time it took longer to recover. In the ER, some nurses were suggesting that I’m faking it, it’s for attention or maybe I just banged my head on a wall for fun. 

After that, I just started getting suicidal thoughts. I tried to get help in another hospital when I wanted to give up, but it looks like they don’t put the brightest doctor on call when it’s a national holiday... So here I am still loosing consciousness and thus banging my head on the floor often, having suicidal thoughts and no more trust in the healthcare system.

What’s the point to live a life where you fall at random times and scare other people without reasons? What’s the point to live a life where you can’t even get proper healthcare because you don’t have the same communication skills as other people?"
1324,is life honestly worth living if you are as ugly and awkward as me?,"my absolute hideousness and social retardation means i'm bound to a life of permanent loneliness. whenever i ask whether or not i can still find happiness spending the rest of my life alone, i never receive an answer. only people spewing the same ""there's someone pit there for everyone!!11!!"" bullshit, which is blatantly false. fuck anyone who spreads that lie.

anyone, people's consistent refusal of an answer to this question indicates to me that no, life is not worth living if you spend all your time alone. so why exactly should i want to continue living then? i know for a fact that i'm never going to find anyone, so shouldn't i just die?"
1325,It’s not illegal to seek help,"Please if your struggling with suicidal thoughts please talk to someone, even if it’s a stranger. 
you mean something to this world so don’t take your only opportunity for life. 
 
Talk to me if you need to 


Stay fucking strong, you amazing human ❤️"
1326,Trapped in this existence,The breeders have trapped me here. I need to escape the trap the breeders have put me in here. I didn't consent to this.
1327,I can't ever seem to catch a break,"When I was a child, I was neglected and abused. 

I would see my father every few months and he would always give me the excuse of ""your mother never lets me see you!"", while my mother would say ""your father doesnt care to see you.""

As an adult, I can accurately say that both statements are true. 

My mother didn't keep me from him to protect me. She lives through fear tactics, manipulation and control. She is the textbook definition of a narcissist. When I turned 7, she kicked my brother out for mouthing off (he was 13), and then blamed it on me. She told me ""he left because you were a horrible sister.""

I believed her. As a young child she used to always tell me ""your father left because you were a horrible daughter.""

So, if that was true, me being a horrible sister wouldn't be too far fetched, right? 

After my brother left, my mother turned her extreme anger and abusive control methods onto me. At the age of 10, I was so emotionally and physically run down and depressed, that the only viable options for me were to

A) Run Away
B) Kill Myself

I opted on suicide. I had many suicide attempts in middle school and high school and countless psyche ward visits (my stay within the mental wards were a welcome release from my chaotic home life). My mother used this to her advantage, and began to drag me around to a handful of psychiatrists. She would get one to put me on a medication and continue to have them up the dosage. 
The kicker is, she wouldnt tell the other psychiatrists about the meds I was on, so they were all under the impression I was only one one medication - the medication they prescribed me. 

At the age of 12, I was on the maximum adult dosage of

1 anti anxiety medication
1 anti depressant
2 anti psychotic
And 1 sleeping pill 

No one trusted me to be in charge of my medication, so I had to take my pills when my mother handed them to me. She would give me my sleeping pill right as I would come home from school. I would eat dinner and then try my best to stay away. Normally, I would fall asleep around 5:30-6. 

I'm not sure what her end goal was. I don't think she was trying to kill me, but.. Maybe this was her way of not dealing with me. I dont know. 

When I was 13, I refused my medication. I would scream that I don't need them and I am not crazy. She would beat me. I started calling the cops, regularly, and it got to the point where she took out all the phones in the house. She convinced me that the police officers would laugh at me for calling them because she's just trying to be a good parent and get after me when I'm being bad. 

She convinced me I deserved everything bad that happened to me. I truly believed her. 

The day after she would hurt me, she would take me shopping and then ask me ""Where did you get this bruise?"" And completely deny ever hurting me. I started to believe all of her beatings were imagined and I began to question my memories and reality. 

She eventually kicked me out after I stopped taking me medication for a month and I began to realize everything she had told me was a lie. I started to stand up for myself. She didn't know what to do. 

My father came to get me. He was unemployed and lived with his parents. We shared a room for a while. He was emotionally detatched, and I could tell he wanted to help me, but he didn't know how. He would bring me to therapy every week and he helped me taper off all of the medication. My therapist diagnosed me with Complex PTSD and told my father it was going to be a tough few years... She was right. 

I suffered from horrible nightmares and flashbacks, daily. 

When I was 14, I turned to pills when I would get caught in a flashback. It dulled everything. It made me feel like a normal human. It stopped the flashbacks. 

The next few years were riddled with hospital visits from intentional, and unintentional, overdoses and many inpatient treatment facilities for my PTSD and drug addiction. 

My father didn't know what to do.

So, he gave me to the state. From there, I was moved around from shelters, group homes, and foster care. 

While I was being shipped around, I was raped a handful of times. When I lost my virginity, I was blackout drunk, and woke up with a man on top of me. The time after that? I was drugged and raped by two adult mexican males. It was highly traumatic. They took turns raping me and laughed as I cried. I tried to get away when one wanted to penetrate me anally, and they accidentally pushed me. I hit my head, hard, on a toilet (this was in a bathroom) and I remember seeing blood on the bathroom floor and the two men freaking out. One of them began to cry and say ""I didn't mean to kill her."" 

When I woke up, they were still there, and they started to rape me, again. 

As an adult, I stopped doing drugs in excess. I have tried to get my life back together, somehow. I want to became a ""sucess story"" and prove to the world (or maybe myself) that after everything that has happened, I can still FUNCTION and THRIVE just like everyone else...

But,

I'm still waiting for the day that I feel okay. I'm still waiting for the day I stop screwing up everything good that comes into my life. I'm terrified of everything. Love, a stable job, friends. I run from it all.

I feel like a failure because I can't seem to grasp what normality and stability looks like. Is this some concept that has no validity in my reality? 

...

When I was 18, I got into a physically abusive relationship with my first love. After my childhood, it makes sense why I would choose an equally toxic partner. I grew up, a little, and left him.

When I was 19, I was hanging out with a recent ex of mine, and he raped me. 

When I was 20, I got engaged to a man that was severely bipolar and not on his medication. He manipulated me as much as my mother did. I grew up a little more, and left him. 

When I was 22, I met a man and formed a surf rock band with him. I got pregnant and had an abortion. He left me 2 days later. Guess he got scared. I don't blame him. (Well, maybe a little) 

...

After my botched childhood, terrible sexual encounters, and one-sided romantic relationships,

Nothing has ever effected me as much as my abortion. 

I've always tried to live with the idea that I should NEVER make anyone feel as low as I have felt. 

But,

I killed my own unborn child. That's worse than anything anyone has done to me. I never even gave him a chance to live. 

I don't know if my inability to get over my guilt is a symptom of repressed emotions from other traumas, or if this is because I wanted to be a better mother than the one I have

I don't know anything.

But, I know that I don't want to live this life, anymore. I've never really wanted it. I kept hoping that ONE DAY things would magically get better. ONE DAY I could do great things and find happiness.

But, 

Now I have blood on my hands, and no matter how hard I scrub it, the stains remain. 

I don't know how to cope with my life. I don't want to. I don't want any of this, anymore. 

Is it so wrong to give up?"
1328,Worthless and forgotten,"I have repeated the same day for about 3 months.

Class, home, sleep - without talking to or approaching anyone

No friends, no relationship, almost 0 human contact, and literally no physical contact.

I hate everything about myself, especially my looks, but also how stupid I am.

What is the best method to die quickly and painlessly, I’ll leave nothing behind, most people forget I exist, and want NOTHING to do with me.

My mind is in turmoil and I want a fast solution.

Please provide, thanks.

~ Jest"
1329,Ever wish you could go back,"As you are now, the age you are now and all the memories of you have now. And find your younger self and kill him? Tell him it's all for the best and that you'll save alot of people pain? And if paradoxes are to be believed, you'll cease to exist as well."
1330,People can’t choose death camly,Anyone who is thinking about death right now will never live to see the end of it. That lost potential being barred in the ground. Another person lost. Choosing death is not the answer. Please...
1331,There's no other way,"I'm 22 now. I am not going to graduate this year due to financial issues, but my parents don't know this. I live with them and my younger sister. When I was 14 I posted to social media saying I was depressed and my father found out when my aunt told him. He threatened to divorce my mother and leave us and then he beat me. When all was said and done he sat me down and told me he loved me and was sorry. This was normal. 

I have been raped twice, once by one close friend and once by someone who not only knew I had been raped previously but who I thought was a friend. I have been sexually abused/assaulted every year since I was 13. I have been suicidal since then, with four failed attempts. 

I don't know what solutions there are. I have begun self harming again. I cry at work where no one can see me and at school on a daily basis. I feel so alone, even with my friend. I hate this world. I am making a plan to die next year. I'm sorry."
1332,I need someone to talk to,"Hi everybody

I'm new here and I'm scared and need someone to talk to.

If you want to see some more in depth background, you can look in my past activity in some other groups, namely the multiple sclerosis group but I'll summarize why I'm posting here.

I suffer from Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis which is a progressive disease that damages your nerves and function slowly fades unless you are properly medicated and respond to the medication, and even then there is a slow deterioration. I am a 26 year old male who used to be very athletic and used to be a marine and am a single father with custody of my child, though the mother is still in my kid's life. 

I am ashamed to admit this, but I want to die and throughout the day today, have come up with 6 different plans to do it but manage to stop myself before getting very far. My mobility is gone, I have multiple seizures daily, I have multiple m.s. hugs (for those who don't know it's tightening of the diaphragm that is excruciatingly painful and draining in my case), my seizures leave me unable to speak or use my hands very well, I don't have the energy to interact with my kid, I feel that I am failing as a boyfriend, I'm unable to deal with any stress in a healthy way.

I just spent 5 months in a mental health facility and was doing okay and then the second stress starts happening and I'm unable to resolve it due to my medical/physical/mental limitations and exhaustion, I want to quit and give up. I feel like I'm screaming inside and I can't even vocalize it because of the seizures. I feel like a fucking husk or a shell of a person and I feel like a piece of shit for considering leaving my kid, boyfriend, and family behind but I just don't want to fucking do this anymore. An existence where I have to exist in a body that is falling apart is not an existence that I want to be a part of.

I don't know what I'm hoping for by posting this here, but I figured I'd do it. I've already been on 3 suicide hotlines today. I don't want to go back to another mental hospital but I'm not above doing it. I just want to try some different things before I do so."
1333,To Anyone going through something,"Dear reader,
Look, if your reading this just know that someone loves you. I have no clue what anyone has gone through, suicide,depression,self harm ect. There is one thing I ask of you,please don’t take your own life and seek help. If your having suicidal thoughts there’s always someone you can talk to even, if it’s a stranger. I know life can be hard and painful, if you work hard enough you can get through it, and you can do it if your willing to change. I hope this changed your mind about suicide- if not then I have failed. I’m sorry 





If  anyone needs me, text me or some shit. I love you ❤️"
1334,Please Help me!,"Greetings fellow redditors, i have recently changed the city that i live in. I have 0 people that i can go out with, not even talking about relationship. Ive had a girlfriend that we were 5 years together and made the biggest mistake in my live, abandoning my previous friends i grew up for a girl. Now we are no longer to-gether and im stuck all alone. In my country stuff like tinder and etc dont work. Girls are only impressed by cars and muscules. Im an average funny person who is chasing a dream becoming a developer. My studies are entirely online and i dont get to see anybody. Please help me what to do. In this position im getting into heavy depression. Constantly want to cry, suicidal thoughts and being scared. Please give me any help you can i don't want this to end bad. Thank you for your time reading and appreciate your help!"
1335,Are there any resources for assisttane?,"I was reading through the about page looking for  anything that can help me right now but there's nothing but talk lines.

For example I need help finding a roommate that isn't a complete psychopath and will just leave me alone and pay the bills on time?

Or even better a home by myself?  But I don't know anywhere in the United States that has affordable housing, and I make more than minimum wage.

I really feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard spot and everyone wants to talk, no doing.

Are there any phone numbers or organizations I can call for doing something to get out of here before my roommate kills me, or I do."
1336,I’m thinking of just disappearing.,"I’m going to be homeschooled soon, and I know then I can finally stop talking to all my friends and they can’t do anything about it. If I stop talking to them than maybe that’ll just forget about me and I won’t feel as bad when I off myself. I already know that I’ll never get better and I’m only doing more harm to myself staying alive."
1337,an uninteresting title,"I don’t want to kill myself but I won’t stop thinking about it. I have things I live for but I know I’m on the brink of going off the edge. I still want to live for my dog,  my stuffed animals and wanting to help people in need but I’m just so tired of thrudging on. I know if I continue on in this mental state I’m going to do it. 
I don’t want my dog to wonder where I am after I do it, I don’t want my mom to be really sad, I know that will be too much for her because she has had lost a friend to suicide. 
I don’t want to do it but something inside me gave up. I know that soon enough I will give up entirely, I try so hard but it seems and feels like I’m just getting worst and worst, my therapist thinks I’m getting better a bit. Yeah the anxiety is gone but my depression or whatever it is... is worst then ever. Even my coping mechanisms don’t work, minecraft isn’t helping me escape anymore, my games don’t keep me distracted and my friends stress me out. Its been years since I’ve done something I genuinely liked, can’t even pick up a book and read one page, can’t draw, can’t even fucking laugh at jokes. I can’t fucking do it anymore. People think I’m doing so much better since I don’t have my anxiety anymore but hell I almost prefer that time, where at least I could distract myself. Have you ever felt like this. I’m sorry"
1338,I miss you so much,"When I met you here on reddit, I found you a bother. You had weird conversations, texted me at odd times, complained about my depression, and mocked my progressivism. But after a while I gained a real affection for you, with your unerring defenses that you were Canadian and not Indian, with your affectionate nicknames (""DanDan"" and ""sweetheart""), your intelligence. I realized that every time I saw your snoovatar or thought of your face, a warmth came in my heart. And then you started to draft apart; You said you loved me and I trusted it. I was very depressed, I was very unstable. And after you said I was very depressed and so you didn't want to talk to me, I said I was in love with you. Maybe it was true, maybe not. Being in one of my crises, I said I felt superior to you and thought it outrageous that you didn't love me. You broke it up, you said I never liked you, and that besides me being always emotionally distant, I had always thought you were stupid and boring. No, Molly, I never thought this. And now that I'm almost killing myself, my only wish is to say that I've always really liked you, your intelligence, your sweetness, that I dream about you almost every day, I think of hugging you, holding you in my arms and crying, and that I love you and that I adore you. Now I can only think that me dying is the only way you'll forgive me. I hurt you and I'm most sorry I did so."
1339,I have nothing to look forward to so why shouldn't i?,"I have had no excitement in my life, nothing to look forward to, no friends to miss me, half a family that hates me, the other half couldn't care less, so what's the point? I might just slit my wrists and be done with it, i dont wanna be here anymore everyday is exactly the same, the exact same stuggle to put on a mask and pretend to be happy for people around me, the same exact mundane tasks to do and the same exact people and environment around me, i feel like death is the most dynamic change and a change that needs to happen for me to finally be satisfied"
1340,Everyday is Hell but No one cares,"I want this neverending loneliness to end already. I'm tired of not having friends or a loving family. Humans arent meant to be alone their entire life why cant I just have 1 person to truly care about me? It fucking hurts so much to see others dating, having amazing lives while I pity myself 24/7 for missing out on having a normal human experience... I keep having mental breakdowns weekly and its starting to destroy me. 2020 wont be a good year.."
1341,Give me reasons,"I need some reasons to stay alive. Just a couple. Some that will make me genuinely want to stay. 

Today I realized no one cares about me. My family, my partner, my friends. Everyone showed today that they don't care about my wellbeing and happiness and future and health. No one cares. It's devastating. I'm fighting a war by myself and everyone wants to see me fail. 

Please give me reasons. I can't find any to stay."
1342,This misfit is tired of the struggle,"I’m just so tired of struggling and being unhappy. I’m lonely and alone and see no end to this....just want it to be over. I called the suicide hotline tonight and it was pretty much useless. Tomorrow is the anniversary of my dad killing himself and would be a good day for me to leave this world too. I want to die badly but worry how my son will handle it, but he can’t be having a good life knowing his mother is fucked up and miserable. I want to die. I want this misery and lonely struggle over. I’m older and know if it changes it’ll only be temporary. Life is a drag for some of us of misfits. Life is sadness to varied degrees. I’m a broken misfit. I want to die."
1343,A little pretentious thing I wrote on my phone: Schrödinger’s noose,"Horribly embarrassing but wanted to share anyways.

People have called me strong for holding out for so long, or a coward for not ending it yet. 

Well, what is it? 

Am I strong or am I a coward?

The funny thing is that killing myself won’t even solve this dilemma.

I’ll either be weak, or brave.

What am I?

I’m both.

I’ll hang myself with Schrödinger’s noose.

Whoever opens the door and finds me will determine what I truly am."
1344,I just wish I could die already.,"I'm tired of fearing people will hate me, tired of seeing other people suffer and not being able to do anything. I wish I could die already and stop suffering."
1345,Life,Yeah umm my life kinda sucks I mean it isnt as bad as most people but it is just kinda crappy you know. I mean I've tried to stop cutting for the last year but I still havent. I also have suicidal thoughts everyday and yet I still have to be strong for all my friends because they have worse lives then me and I take care of them. But some days I just want to leave the world all the stress and drama. I just dont know what to do because I've tried commiting suicide and ended up in an impatient so yeah. Idk what to do.
1346,Sick of the rollercoaster,"I am so tired of the constant up and down of emotions.  I hate being so weak and selfish,  I destroyed the man that I love, yet I cry that he doesn't want me anymore? I can be fine for hours and then a memory or a throwaway comment will make me cry and cry. And yet this is all my own fault,  I deserve every nasty text,  every nasty look or comment made whilst in public.  How can I moan that all my friends have disowned me, when I did it? And yet I do. 
I resolved after my first post that I would live for my kids, my husband said that was the only thing that I could do to show him that I am truly sorry but even that feels selfish now.  Who am I to decide that my kids need me? I am poison 
I don't want to die anymore but I feel like I need to. I  am so sick of being in a constant emotional and extreme state of flux."
1347,I want to die so that my family can replace me with someone better.,"I am disgusting. I hate myself and I know that my household is burdened by my existence. I don't want to kill myself because that would be seen as even more selfishness, but I wish I could just die in a very convenient way. I am constantly ruining everything for others that I'm supposed to care about.

About 9 months ago, I cheated on my husband. We had both been under a lot of stress due to finances. During this time, an ex from many years ago messaged me. I messaged back initially thinking he maybe intended to apologize for his past behavior. But no, he just wanted to talk to someone in a sexual way. I didn't stop the conversation. I am garbage and let him talk to me like that. It lasted a couple of days. I never sent any photos or met him, but that doesnt matter. Someone who cares about their family wouldn't have even risked any of that. They would have just ignored the initial message.  Not me. My husband found out after a few days and, reasonably, there is nothing I could ever do to explain, have him believe my remorse, or ever trust anything I say or do. There's zero evidence (how could there be any?) that I didn't send more than messages so he has to assume the worst. I destroyed him. Because of me, he will never be able to fully trust another person and will always be wondering why he couldn't be enough. 

I wish I could fix things. I do love him, but there's nothing I could do to that would make him believe me. I know I don't deserve that anyway, though. Even worse, we have two young children. I ruined the lives of AT LEAST the three of them. I don't know how to proceed. My husband has been depressed ever since and feels he can't tell anyone. On one side, I am scared of everyone knowing the truth of how I am. On the other, more importantly, I don't want him to be miserable. I really don't. I wish I had let him break up with me when we were dating so I wouldn't have had the chance to do this to him. I've tried telling him to please see a therapist, but he tells me how he doesn't have the time. I tried telling him that I want him to be happy, but how can anyone believe me now? I'm just being even more selfish and manipulative every time I try to help. If I actually wanted him to be happy, I wouldn't have been such human filth in the first place. I don't want to be divorced, but I know I'm only making things worse for him and our children. I wish I could just die so he can finally have some relief. Ideally he could find someone who actually treats him better and our kids could have a good mother. 

I just don't know what to do. I know I cheated and I'm disgusting. I can never be right for him or our children. They deserve someone who contributes to improving their lives. All I do is take and take. I'm tired of it. I don't know how to stop."
1348,"I have nothing to lose, technically I do, but I just don't care.","I'm convinced I will not be happy ever again. I don't love anyone, including my only friend and my extremely supportive family. I've been going to therapy for almost 2 months now and it just made me want to die even more. 

Although I want to die, I won't kill myself because I actually believe there's a minimal chance that i'm gonna be in the right place at at the right time to LITERALLY set the world on fire (it's actually the only thing i truly want, like for real).  
I mean, WWI started because a dude killed another dude... So I might aswell try (and with try I mean try not dying to see what is the most fucked up thing I can do)"
1349,how to pass time,"how do i pass long amounts of time. years, how do i pass years worth of time. i need time to go by quickly until November 2021, my living situation has pumelled me into an insufferable, numb depression that i cant seem to get out of and all i can think of doing is getting these two years over with. a medically induced coma sounds amazing right about now. im a minor so i cant go do anything, i just want this to be over. please. id do anything. the thought of having to wait makes me wanna stab myself, 
i want to feel something. i want to feel anything. i want more than anything to just get this shit over with so i can resume where i left off.

its like im in limbo and im desperately clawing to get out but I can't. im stuck in my own personal hell. 

how do i pass large amounts of time?"
1350,I want to die more than ever,"The few friends i have dont understand whats going on. They dont understand the anorexia, the ptsd, the depression, the anything. Im done. Im done with my parents yelling at me when i do something thats out of my control. Im done with their double standards, im done with failing school, im done with this stupid fucking world. Its all hopeless. I cant do anything. I cant even reach out to my true friends who know what ive gone through. I cant do anything"
1351,I am killing myself when the lease is up!,"My mom says I need to ""move out"" or ""start paying Bills when the lease is up"". I am not doing either because there's no point to working a shitty job to pay a landlord just to have space to sleep and do nothing when I'm off. I also don't want to pay my worthless single mom because she doesn't deserve my help. 

This will be the best revenge because my mom, grandma, and brother will be so upset that they can't take it."
1352,Waiting for x amount of time doesn't work after you tell it to yourself too many times,"I have literally lived for years now just telling myself that it will get better and ""just wait until you have done this and that group project"". At this point, I am not even sad but just suicidal. 

I have no desires for Christmas again, but if I could wish for something, it would be that after I die my death wouldn't begin a cycle of mental health problems to other people, such as my parents and friends. 

Oh well, guess I am waiting till the Christmas is over again and then finally do it. I just feel bad for other people feeling sad for me, especially during 'family season'."
1353,I want to die already,"The day I die will be my happiest. I just want to do it already, but I'm too much of a coward. I wish you all luck in being happy, but I don't even remember what that feels like. I've pretty much forgotten how to smile. My life is a void of misery and emptiness"
1354,I'm so lonely and I feel so depressed all the time,"The only people I'm close with are my best friend and my boyfriend but I feel like even they are getting tired of me. 

My best friend barely talks to me outside of school because she's typically busy with all her other friends and whenever we hang out she ends up getting mad at me for stupid reasons.

I call my boyfriend every night and we talk usually until we fall asleep but I've been doing that for weeks now. I know that it's probably annoying but I just feel so alone and all I need someone to talk to. When I complain to him about not having friends he just tells me to go make some which is so much harder for me than him. He has tons of friends and it seems like he just attracts people to him because he makes friends literally anywhere he goes. Meanwhile I have social anxiety and can barely talk to people that I don't already know. Two nights ago I told him about how I cut myself and almost killed myself once and he's barely talked to me much since then and I just hate myself for saying anything at all. 

I have nobody to talk to and I feel so isolated and alone. I really just don't want to be here anymore."
1355,I plan on killing myself.,"Hi,  
I'm fairly new to all of this. I've never had any online support or anything and I only recently joined reddit. I feel as though I have no future, nothing will ever change. I feel like I've hit rock bottom, I can barely get up in the mornings, which is causing me so much trouble; my attendance sucks. I just have no motivation to go about living my life, and I'm seriously considering just ending it all soon. I've never tried seeking support, so please be kind. Thank you."
1356,i'm scared,"just tried to kill myself, i hung myself in the shower, my bf came on time and stopped me.

honestly i cant do this anymore , my parents are very religious and me dating a dude bothers them so much 

i keep being told its not natural , and to keep it to myself , i really love them and they don't have money i take care of them and they see me as their future .

i just never see how things gets better ..

i told my bf i dont really want to die i told him iwanna live and travel with him and become a dad .

i really just dont want to disappoint my family ( i feel ok myself , they think its a shameful   thing ).

i am really scared of myself, i made my bf cry and i just wanna make him happy. i feel so horrible .. i dont know what to do..."
1357,"What is the point of life if ""life isn't fair""?","Anytime I don't like something they say ""life isn't fair or ""get over it kid"". It's like they are getting on to me like it's my fault I feel the way I do. Why do they expect me to be alive and live my miserable life?

So what's the point of life if I don't have a lot of money, if I am ugly, don't have nice things, or don't have awesome and caring family/friends? Fuck all you people who want me to live this miserable life."
1358,"the only reason i haven't killed myself yet is that my dog would be sad, the second my dog is gone i will be too",
1359,The most heartbreaking thing is knowing someone’s love is conditional,
1360,I need help!,I'm not going to post what I need help with but if you are cool with doing something somewhat illegal tell what state you live in. I'm not trying to end my life but stop myself from doing it. Help me!
1361,I don’t want to be here anymore,life is shit it fucking sucks and I hate it. I just want to slit my wrists and end everything. I’ve tried twice this year both failing got antidepressants which are just making me more suicidal. I can’t bear to be here anymore I just hate it so so much I wish I was dead.
1362,Needing someone to talk to.,"I want someone to talk to. I’m extremely lonely, and I am ready to surrender my dog at a local shelter here in san francisco. Then Idk how to deal with these negative emotions anymore. I cannot handle it anymore. I don’t know what else to do. I feel closer to actually hurting myself."
1363,my ptsd,"My ptsd is getting out of hand and i want to go to the hospital but
- I’m a minor (mid teen) and my ptsd involves my family and still has to see my abuser
- I have finals
- It’s near the holiday season


I have ptsd (diagnosed) from sexual abuse within the family and i have to see my abuser and i am constantly triggered from it, but my parents don’t care because 
“he’s family”
“it happened so long ago”
last time i got outside help involved with my ptsd my dad yelled at me on how i’m tearing the family apart and being selfish. he said how i should just go to my room when he comes over. i shouldn’t have to hide in my room to feel safe. 

it’s just becoming a lot for me, and everything else just seems to stack ontop of it"
1364,"As negative as my mindset is, I like to see it written. Because at least it's there to see.","My life is a big pile of almosts, of very filtered happiness and poor choices. I'm tired, I don't know the last time I was happy without having my mind bombard me ruining everything or having another worry to spoil it. In a way I know why it is, I don't like me, so not to say I hate myself.

At times I wish it ended already, because at times feeling better for a while and then coming back seems like a mockery. I wish something would kill me so I could stop thinking I can do better. Fuck me, I'm just fucking sad."
1365,"These will be the last 2 months of my life, maybe","I have borderline personality disorder

No matter what good plan I make for my life, it always gets crushed by reality and the fucking system. Want to move to a new country and work? Oh, you can't. The immigration laws won't let you. Want to work in that cool company? 340 applicants and most likely they boss's friend will get hired. Want to get into cool fields such as data science? Oh, I can't... the dyscalculia (number dyslexia) won't let me.

I am going to a trip in Jan 2020 and returning on Feb 20. I will kill myself afterwards. At least I got to enjoy the last moments I have of life. At least I will die happily.

I am done trying to work on my dream job which is one that is away from 9 to 5 and the cubicle. I simply cannot grasp the fact that I have to work full time in an office, confined... until I retire at 60 and THEN ACTUALLY START TO LIVE LIFE AND DO WHAT I MISSED OUT ON WHILE I WAS YOUNG. I refuse to be a slave. Can't freelance because I don't have marketable skills. Can't get a job because of that too.

As a 22 year old recent grad with a pointless double major, I might even end up working as a waitress as I see these happy web developers and engineers and doctors earn a good salary. My family can't stand me and I'm a burden to  them. They always complain about how lazy I am and stuff, invalidating my feelings and struggles, talking as if I didn't have battles to fight. I just got off from an argument with my mom and his boyfriend who yells at me like he was my dad. Why was I even born if I am just taking up space and people bitch about me? Might as well not be around anymore.

Being a recent grad with zero future and job even if I sent out 100000 resumes, my family's pressure and society's crap is pressuring me to the point that killing myself is the best option. 

Here is a post I made that could add more info regarding my situation, it helps: [https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ea3j15/just\_graduated\_college\_without\_job\_prospects\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ea3j15/just_graduated_college_without_job_prospects_and/) 

Well, I will give myself 2 months. If things are not better by March 1, I'll be done. Knowing me, probably things won't go good. Every time I have hope, reality crushes it. Wish me luck."
1366,Killing myself after Christmas.,I don’t wanna do it before Christmas because I don’t wanna ruin my family’s good time. I’ve been depressed since I was 16. I’m 20 now. After high school things really went downhill. Lost most of my friends. Can’t get a girlfriend. I’m lonely and my life has no meaning.
1367,I can’t breathe,I have been outside for almost 12 hours. I’m usually never outside for this long but I had to volunteer and then ran errands with my family. Being around people so much all day and faking a healthy image was so taxing. My suicidal thoughts have maxed out. I’ve been heavy breathing and crying for the last 15 minutes and I feel like my vision is progressively blurring.  I don’t know what to do. How do I calm down?
1368,I'm selfish and I'm finally going to do it,"I've picked a date. I have a plan. I can't tell anyone how I'm feeling because they'll try to convince me not to. I'm just worried about not succeeding and suffering from brain damage because I don't have the resources or means for an alternative that would fully guarantee my death. That's the only thing that scares me. I live alone in a different country than the rest of my family and friends, and I have no one here. I'm just worried how long it'll take for someone to find me and what will happen with my cats after I die..."
1369,This world is so fucked up,"I hate the city I live in. It’s filled with mostly trash people. I can’t go to my hometown. For whatever reason, I always meet fucked up people which further pushes me into isolation. I’m fairly certain I have some sort of paranoid disorder. I miss having someone to trust. I struggle with wanting a relationship but feel like I’m not good enough. I want to be able to connect with someone but I think I’ve lost the inability to do so. My cousin killed himself January 31st and as a “fuck you” to my family, I want to do the same, but I don’t think I can wait that long. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I feel like a shell of a person. I keep telling myself that I’ll start to feel better soon, but I’ve only been feeling worse. I really don’t think my mind can get better. I don’t think I’ll ever be happy or feel content or be able to do normal people things. The world is just too fucked up and I don’t want to be apart of it anymore."
1370,Suicide and the aftermath,"For those that have had family members or friends that committed suicide. Could I ask, what was the aftermath like?"
1371,empty words make me angry,"is it normal that people saying ""you'll be fine"" or  ""you'll get better"" ""stay positive"" pisses me off so much i get angry? anyone else feel this way. i feel like crying. this is all i get from anyone"
1372,I want to live but I don’t think I can anymore,"I’m so messed up right now. I don’t want to die, but I don’t know how much longer I can deal with these feelings. Melanoma is on my mind all the time. I’m afraid of moles, pimples, bumps, dry skin, etc. I am even noticing moles on other people and panicking. It’s driving me insane, and nothing is working to help me feel better. 

I’ve been to the dermatologist so much that they laugh at me now. It’s pathetic and I’m pathetic. I think maybe I should just leave this world. I’m not living and no one understands what it’s like to constantly worry about melanoma. I don’t even know why I’m so focused on melanoma when I’ve never even had it. The worst I’ve had is a severely atypical mole."
1373,I’m such a awful person,"I want to die so badly, for so long.

Family tell me I bring everyone down - Waste of space etc.

I just feel so awful for being so bad. 

I hurt people so much. Wanna end it, wanna do it so badly. It hurts so much."
1374,I’m sittin here...,"I’m sitting here, dying in my prom dress. I’d be the prom queen if dying was a contest...."
1375,throwing a goodbye party,"Hi,
As I’m writing this my friends are over at my house and we’re having a Christmas sleepover. Monday, I’ll end my life. I’ve thought about this for a long time. It was supposed to be the third, but then I pushed it back the fourth, fifth, sixth... I’m tired of waiting. I can’t do this anymore. I see no future in myself other than suicide. If its not now, it’ll be at 18. If its not then, it’s 19. When people ask me what I want to be in the future, there’s a blank. A dark hole. I don’t do work I need to do because I reckon I’ll be dead before the deadline.
I dropped out of school, due to some issues with my provinces government (tldr: they won’t let me in a smaller school I need, even with proof it’ll help, just because I’m French and the schools in English). I feel worthless. They don’t give a shit about me. They’d rather save a language than me. The systems fucked up.

I have no skills other than writing, but even then, it’s lacklustre and not memorable. I gave up. I want to make my last months worth it to me. If I wont use my education, whats the point?
I felt as though I needed to share my story. Please remember that when I’ll leave I’ll be happy as I spent my last moments with the people I love the most.
I hope everyone browsing this sub and posting finds peace. Goodbye, and please, follow your dreams."
1376,It's been a tough 8 years,"Today, my roommate and friends ( whom I've all known since childhood) are visiting and out and about without me.
Granted, I did say I didn't want to participate this weekend. I did however,text them through my S.O.s profile to tell them that I needed to feel more included to participate. (Depression makes no sense).
However, my roommate came home, dropped food off, and left again without saying anything. I feel disheartened, unloved, and as if my suicidal thoughts are validated. Who cares? I've now seen... might as well rid the earth of this waste of space."
1377,"I no longer feel anger, i just feel...defeated","Terrible childhood (sexual/physical/mental abuse, abandoned by father), terrible social life, terrible platonic experiences, never had a GF, etc...

The shit i go through, the loneliness forced upon me feels so overwhelming that i just stopped trying. I have experienced nothing but mental and physical torture from this life and it has never gotten any better, not for a split second. I try to delude myself into thinking that it's actually all fine by just trying to stay positive, laughing and smiling but it never works.

I'm just laying here watching myself drown, my brain starving for dopamine/serotonin, no motivation and no reason to do anything or to keep going. Life is unfair, or maybe i just wasn't made for life (or for this shitty version of ""life"" that i was born into)."
1378,"Functioning ""normally"" while wanting to kill myself 24/7","I have great friends, my studies our kinda going ok, I  have interests, passions... but I still hate everything about me and want to kill myself every moment of my life. My letter has been ready for quite some time now, at any moment I can just do it. I actually find myself ""getting ready"" to do it quite often. 

Psychotherapy and antidepressants worked in the sence that I'm still alive, but they've done nothing to actually change my mindset about this. I wonder if it's even worth trying to do something about since I feel like it's just the way I am. I can't explain it well, but I just have this gut feeling that my life should be short and that I should be dead soon. I've felt this way since I was a little girl, so I don't think/know if this is something that can change. 

I can't keep unloading all my problems on my friends, but I also don't know if starting therapy again will help. I just have no idea what the fuck to do."
1379,I miss them too much to bear.,"It's been three whole years since I last saw my ex and her son. Three years of loneliness and hard drinking, of crying myself to sleep. I had someone so deep, so loving, so full of love and passion and art and I let it all slip away through my selfish, stupid actions. I traded someone who wanted to spend her life with me for the bottle. She doesn't even hate me, she said she forgave me, moved on. softly says 'take care,' in her little French accent. I can't move on from her, I cannot face my current situation, homeless and alone in the winter. Far away from anyone who loves me . I realize that God had given me my shot, my chance at love and I burned it to ash. I do not want to keep living but I am afraid to die and I feel too guilty for my parents and brother. I don't even have a way to do it . I'm very alone and when I speak to my mother she just says go to the hospital."
1380,"Trying to get my hands on a strong opioid like heroin so I can get drunk, take some xanax and then that and nod off to death peacefully","Fentanyl ideally but that'd be hard. Maybe the heroin would be laced if I'm lucky.


I'm not a user, I've never used or seen opioids in my life even weak ones. Only drugs I do are weed and alcohol.. But I know this combo of benzos, alcohol and opioids can easily lethal. With no opioid tolerance whatsoever the heroin might be enough on its own. I think I know people who know people who could get me heroin 



Seems like such an easy, peaceful way to go at least compared to other things, and with enough of each death is a pretty sure thing. And especially with the xanax (thinking like 50mg) I figure I'd be really calm about the whole thing And nobody would find me, I have nobody in my life. So I wouldn't get narcanned or anything. Just left there to die, like I want."
1381,Does anyone else feel like they were born in the wrong time era?,I feel like I shouldn’t haven’t been born or I should have been born in a different time era. I feel so alone
1382,Fucking TORTURE to keep living. I don’t even have any past trauma or anything. I’m just PATHETIC and WEAK and can’t handle life.,"If there was a book about my life and someone read it, they would be asking ‘why were they so depressed, nothing happened?’  

I want to fucking kill myself but I can’t do that to my family. I want to claw my skin off because of how badly I completely and utterly HATE myself. Such a fucking WORTHLESS person. 

God this is the strongest urge yet. I hope I can stop being so WEAK for once in my life so I can end it.  Fucking BITCH."
1383,Easily the worst part of my life,"Does anyone else not have anyone in their lives? I'm talking about no friends, no significant other, no close family members, nobody. That's the situation I am in right now. The isolation and loneliness kills me. I don't know how much longer I can sustain this. My mental health just keeps on getting worse and worse."
1384,everyday feels like hell,please help me
1385,I'm exhausted..,"I feel useless in this world, and uncapable of being loved. I put a strong facade and go about life but the truth is, when I'm alone, I'm very sensitive and lonely. My depression has been ""under control"" for quite some time but that only lasts for a short while before I fall into a dark pit of despair.

I'm exhausted. I'm alone. I want out from this world."
1386,I want to die but I don't have the balls for it,I'm only in the 10th grade and life's been shit since the 8th grade. I don't know where life went wrong but only that I just realized that slowly that life isn't that great. I'm constantly haunted by the fact that I will never reach any good expectations but will instead only meet the bad ones. I've contemplated suicide more times in from September to December of 2019 than I have ever before in my life. I'm living with the existential dread that I wasn't as good of a person than I thought I was and I feel like a ghost in most social situations. I planned a suicide a while ago with a helium asphyxiation bag method but I don't have most of the materials but I do know where to pass. Nothing you say can stop me even though you may think it will. My mind has gone through hundreds of memories of the worst things I have done and have had done to me and I can only hope there is no hell for me to suffer in for eternity because this life is already enough. I can never understand how and why people can be so painfully ignorant or unwilling to accept the truth because in this world the old man watches the young man die while the young man can only hope the old an will pass before he does. I can only hope that my life some how makes a turnaround or ends quickly so I don't have to feel pain and not be scared of the shit the next day will bring.
1387,its the small things.,"It seems that everyday somewhere I see a meme about depression. People laughing on the outside to make themselves feel better on the inside. I know that I'm the type to share memes about being depressed that are humorous but deep down on the inside I feel like I'm lifeless. Deep down on the inside I feel nothing everyday. A little background about my self, I'm a dad of 2 girls soon to be 2 girls and 1 boy, I'm in the military, and I struggle everyday with depression without anyone in the world noticing. 

Everyday is a great day on the outside. you can ask my friends and family. I'm the most outgoing person who is always there when you need me to be. I have a ton of friends and a family yet everyday I'm alone. 

Its the small things in this world that add up to where I am today I guess. small things like when my wife told me that I ruined her happiness. when she told me that as soon as I enlisted her life ended. its the small things like everyday when I build her up to make her feel confident, sexy, smart because I know she struggles with anxiety and poor self image, she shrugs it off as if my words don't mean anything to her. its the small things like when I feel trapped in a job I hate surrounded by leadership that consistently fails me, leadership that only cares about there own career progression and how they look rather than the needs of there soldiers. its the small things like when I reach out to close friends and they don't care enough to hold a conversation with me. its the small things like when I go home every year on leave and no one wants to take the time out of there day to come see me even though I just drove 12 hours home to see them. Theres a darkness deep inside of me that I can feel everyday. I feel at time that my head is under a pillow and I'm gasping for air. I'm kicking and screaming on the inside to be noticed so someone can help me. 

I was never the popular kid growing up. I always struggled to fit in which meant me acting like someone I wasn't to feel that way. I'm an attractive guy. I'm loving I'm caring and I try my hardest to please everyone. so why cant I be happy? when is it my turn? is it even worth it to continue being the human I am? I've thought about killing my self in the past but I would never do it. I couldn't do it even if I tried. I love my family too much to do that to them. I guess ill just live the rest of my life in the shell of a man who once was."
1389,Help. Stuck in broken VR game. Cannot exit or reload.,"I played this new virtual reality earth sim game and only got partly through early adulthood before I started having wierd glitches, my character was unusually weak, had failing organs, erroneous pain signatures, and stuff like that. None of the healers could help me. My stats/level went down, I was locked out of accomplishing anything in the main quest or most of my old side quests and could only play a limited number of trivial side quests for people with low stats and limited mobility.  The graphics even started glitching and I guess I was having lag or something too.

 I dont think this is how the game was designed. So my first thought was to frag and reload the map like a rational person but I couldn't figure out how to do this. Most games have like a K button you can just press to respawn. So I went to what I thought was the in game support staff with these concerns and then the weirdest thing happened. Instead of helping me they sent out these enemy guards which locked me in this in game prison for 3 days and it was really inconvenient. Now I keep getting told all these bizarre things like ""this isn't a game"", ""this is real life"", ""you only live once"", you can't respawn, respawning is a sin, or the admins will get angry and punish me with fire. 

I had enough and tried to take off my VR helmet. To my horror, I could not find the helmet and it seems the game has my body immobilized using some kind of gear or I guess the sleep paralysis mechanism. Now I am panicking. I am stuck and cannot exit the game. I tried to manually frag and I got all these error messages about my character's animal instincts not allowing it. I finally figured out a hacky way around the animal instincts only to get stuck in this infinite quantum mechanics loop where everytime I frag, I teleport back to a decision point before I fragged. I am truly stuck. Meanwhile the game's haptics keep zapping me with those pain signatures and they are getting worse. This game sucks. I want my money back."
1390,Giving myself a couple more days untill i kill myself,My plan is to take a lot of benadryl and melatonin than an hour after that take a whole lot of oxy and tylenol #3 (about 60). Last time i attempted this i got the medicine out before anything could happen. Does anyone know how long it will take for it to work or what i can expect.
1391,I feel like giving up,"My boyfriend is threatening to leave me, we live together in his country and I’m alone here. We’ve been together for almost a year and a half.
Today I left work early because I felt anxiety and stress from it. He told me that the only way for it to be okay was if I promised him to never do this again. 
The fact that I had a previous job I left after a day for the same reason explains his concerns, but now I’ve kept this job for over 2 months.
I feel like giving up. I’ve tried to give life a chance so many times and I thought I was happy but this is killing me right now and I don’t know how I could ever recover from it.
I’ve never felt this bad before, I feel threatened by him and I feel like there’s no way out, I could never just go back to my country and live with my parents again.
I feel so unwanted in this world."
1392,Just recently tried to kill myself,"I chickened, obviously. But for a short moment, for a tiny, breaf moment I finally felt myself in control of my life. I was the one who could've decide whether I live further or die. 

Felt like my body was going numb and I'm rapidly fainting, and if I didn't quickly pulled up, I'd have been dead by now.

I don't know the moral of this post, I just felt like sharing. I will kill myself soon, so might as well share my experience while I still can."
1393,There is the have and have not's in this cold social media ran Society,"I don't know how many years that I have left but I am  getting very tired of living my life in depression and no growth. My whole life, I have had social issues,was a loser and no attractive women has ever been attracted to me. I'm currently 33 years ago and I still don't have my life together and live in my mother's basement. I don't have any friends anymore because all of them are married and have kids. Another thing that is toxic is social media. It makes me feel very depressed when people I know that are my age or younger are progressing in life except for me. I have been trying for 5 years to meet and approach attractive women that I like but it always fails no matter how well I dress and how much money I make or the cologne I wear. Even having a great conversation doesn't help. Over the past 5 years, I have been masturbating to porn lusting over attractive women and having one night stand sex with trannys and fem gay bottoms only just to substitute to fact that attractive women don't won't me. I feel like I have to have sex with someone. I tried to tell my family about my depression but no one gives a shit. Im starting to get to the point of  finding a way to die in my sleep peacefully so that I don't have to wake up in the morning and continue this miserable life on being alone."
1394,"This is all a big mistake, I don't want to be here, I want to go back to being dead","Life just isn't for me, I'm a pathetic waste with high expectations. I don't want to be here anymore. Carrying out another 60 years of pointless survival actions is too much. I don't want any of this. I really revere those who have the courage to go through with killing themselves I wish I could do it right now. I fail to see what's so bad about being dead."
1395,I just want to die,"Welp, I originally was gonna do this anonymously but if you look at my profile and see my comments, you can see that I have issues. Anyhow, I just really don’t know what to do anymore. I should be happy. I have friends, a family, and everything that a high schooler should need. Except the ability to talk to my parents about things that’s out of the question. Thing is, I never feel good enough. I was also like this last year, and I cut way more back then. I’ve cut once this year, but I don’t know if it’ll stay that way. 

Most of the time, my friends make me feel worse. They offer me advice, and try to help me. I don’t generally end up taking the advice or something along those lines and then they get annoyed at me. It leads to me getting lectured, and makes me feel worse. They tell me how I need to stop saying depressing rants so much. They tell me to stop being so sensitive, and to stop texting people so much. The fact is, they’re not wrong. That’s what hurts the most. It just feels like they’re getting mad at me for not being better yet, and that I need to pretend to be ok. 

Sometimes, I can smile, and I’m happy. Other times, I get utterly crushed and wonder why I’m even here. Friends try to say how important I am, how much they’d miss me and how I don’t deserve to die. But it never sticks. I never believe them. I can’t believe them. That’s dangerous. I trust people too easily, meaning I can easily get attached to someone and be utterly broken when things go wrong or I get rejected. Most of the time, I’d probably seem okayish to an outsider. Truth is, I’ll make a lot of jokes about how I want to die, and say mood when my friends say depressing shit. They immediately get mad at me, telling me I can’t say that. I honestly don’t really feel like I have anyone to go to, too worried that I’ll ruin relationships if I’m open. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done that. It’s probably why I lost my best friend recently. He ended the friendship, and it’s probably all my fault. 

I can’t talk to my friends, most of them don’t understand and they make me feel worse. Some I wouldn’t mind talking to, but they never respond since they never use their phones or are busy. I just wish I felt like I deserve to live. But I don’t and I doubt I ever will. I’m also very emotional, which my friends and mom make sure I remember. I apologize all the time, and I always feel bad when I cry and when I ramble about my problems. So many people have it so much worse than me and here I am, complaining how I want to die. My parents also make me feel worse, adding to my sadness and saying bs that doesn’t help. 

I want to reach out, I want help, but I feel like I’ve reached out too much. I go see the social worker at school and I’m gonna get a therapist probably but still. I just don’t know what to do since I’ve had this horrible mindset for so long and using self help books doesn’t really do anything. Sometimes it feels like it can help, but I don’t have enough motivation to look at it often enough for that to matter. I have a decent amount of friends, but I don’t really feel close to any of them. I just feel like I’m bothering people with my problems and I don’t wanna be such an idiot. I want to hang out with people and feel like I’m normal and not the one who’s excluded from everything. I want to be invited to things, and feel included. I’m not friends with most of my classmates, and it’s probably gonna stay that way. 

I just wanna feel ok. But that feels like a distant dream rather than a possible reality. I’ve exhausted my sources, and people are getting tired of dealing with me. Everyone will eventually abandon me, and I’ll be left alone. It’ll be all my fault, and I won’t be able to do anything about it. I’ll just cry, and wish I could be anyone else, a better person. I’ll cut myself as punishment, and wish for the sweet release of death. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to anything to kill my self with so I can’t actually go through with anything but I want to do it so bad. I feel like a horrible daughter, a horrible friend, a horrible person. My mental state is utterly fucked, and I don’t know what to do. 

I guess this is a cry for help, but that’s cause I’m pathetic and can’t manage on my own. I cry out for help too much, and people stop caring. It makes sense, but it’s not like I’m faking anything. I’ll just not tell my friends at school what happened over the weekend, and shut myself off from them. I can at least do that. And for anyone that actually bothered to read this, I’m sorry. I’m sorry you had to read all this bullshit and hear about all my problems. I’m sorry for wasting your time. No one is probably gonna read this, but this feels like my last chance to reach out before I just wait for it to be really late and go cut. I just hope that I can lose my emotions, and stop caring, cause I’ll cry my eyes out at how horrible I feel like I am and people will try to support me and I still don’t understand. I don’t feel like I ever will. I wanna say please help, but that makes me sound even more pathetic. I’ll just end this by saying I’m sorry I was never good enough, I’m sorry I couldn’t believe everyone’s kind words. I just don’t deserve the kindness you sometimes give me, and I know it’s my fault that I feel this way, and that this is the reason all my relationships fail and I get abandoned by my friends."
1396,I was humiliated because of my penis size. I have a rope ready.,"I'm 20. 6'4"" height, far below average looks.

However, the worst thing is probably penis size. I'm below 3 inches.

Everyday I hear comments about small dicks. Bet he has a small dick, ""small dick energy memes"", big dick is better, simple fact, like a strong jawline is better, just simple facts.

I got humiliated, completely crushed me. Noone is ever seeing it again. How would I even approach sex? ""oh by the way, I have a small dick"" who does that? it would be even more embarrasing in a relationship for the girl, she would know that I have a small dick, would lie to friends, and eventually cheat.

I've always had looks of digust my whole life. Been bullied all my life and completely ignored. I have no talent, ugly, stupid and poor.

How did these genetics survive this long? surely the bad shit would've died out during the thousands of years?

This is the straw that broke the camels back. I hope that everyone else struggling with this or something similar can find comfort and peace with themselves.

I'm off to hang myself at my favourite spot."
1397,I'm done,"I'm done feeling dirty all the time, feeling my gross skin, feeling uncomfortable, feeling gross, feeling unworthy, feeling disposable, feeling broken, feeling like trash, feeling like the worse person ever, feeling hopeless and feeling hurt.

I warn everyone that I have suicidal tendencies. At this point, I only ask God this ""please give me the courage of killing myself""."
1398,I decided not to kill myself when I was 12yrs old... I'm not starting to regret that decision.,"I don't want to wake up tomorrow. Why am I still alive? Whey didn't I just do it? 

I wish I still had hope but I don't. I really don't want to be here anymore. 

I'm dreading Christmas, if anything the 25th just reminds me of how bad life has gotten. Each Christmas has been getting progressively worse.

My head and my throat hurts so much, it feels like they've been tied up in knots. 

I can't emphasis enough on how much I hate myself.

Why did I wait so many years to see if things would get better? They didn't and if anything it has just prolonged the pain."
1399,I have decided it’s done.,"In the next few moments I will be taking about 20 sleeping pills, my dad leaves in 10 minutes for the night and my abusive boyfriend will be at work until 1. If i don’t do it now they will save me again. I don’t want to be saved, I have suffered too much and been loved too little. This life has nothing left for me. I will try to post as a ghost and tell you if there’s an afterlife but no promises. I couldn’t care less about my own well being, I don’t care about what the future holds, I won’t be there. This next part is for my best friends. Amy, Nick... I’m so sorry, my green book on my sunflower shelf has the full notes for you guys. Please keep writing, I love you."
1400,I don't even want to post this,"I live in this endless cycle of pushing people away. Im in a long term relationship right now but my partner works 50-60 hours a week. It's not really working out because we work on opposite schedules. I feel like I'm so weak to even say that. Like how unbelievably selfish of me. But I'm really unhappy. We almost never spend quality time together or have sex. I'm just sad every day. 

I don't really have any friends. I moved to a city six hours away from my home town because I was stuck in an abusive relationship. I've been here for two years but I don't really feel close to anyone. So when my partner is gone I just feel like this unbearable burden. Like I cannot exist without them. I dissociate very heavily on my days alone. Like I can't really tell what I did day to day. Or what it feels like to talk to others. I don't really have any money to go anywhere. 

I go to school and work but my hours were cut pretty hard. So I'm alone a lot. And I wake up and lay around and do nothing. I don't even feel motivated to watch TV. Or play a game. What's the point when everything makes me so miserable. I don't even know what ""enjoyment"" feels like anymore. I just wake up and repeat this process of living/not living. 

I'm like just kind of afraid of everything. I had a really bad bout of anxiety a couple years ago. I couldn't even leave the house for weeks on end. And it's made it hard to make friends. Or anything. I just feel this never ending solitude.


I don't know. I've just been feeling scary low. I guess that's why I'm posting here. Like a weight is pressing on my chest and I'm about to collapse. I wonder often why I'm on this planet or why anyone is here. Everything just feels meaningless at this point. I haven't been able to get help because I don't have insurance or money. And I live in a state that has restrictive medicare. It's just hard and never ending.

Sorry for the long rambling post."
1401,People's reaction to suicide.,"It always puzzled me when people react to someone's suicide with phrases like 'if only he/she told what's bothering them, we'd have helped.' Or something like that.

And while that person was alive and actually asking for help that wouldn't have costed anyone even a single cent, people reluctant or outright dismissive to help. That's sad. Because, suicidal people sometimes tend to look at all options, including asking for help from others."
1402,My entire family is just waiting for me to kill myself already.,How the fuck do I succeed this time? Sick of failure.
1403,"Tired, just tired.","My patience is running thin with life, tired of having so many things being expected from me, tired of having none of my expectations fulfilled. I don't feel human, I don't feel worthwhile. I'm always a last resort with people, always. I want to be a priority, I want to feel loved, I want to feel like I deserve all that and more but I just can't anymore.

I'm tired and have been tired for so long. I don't know how much longer I can hold on to this, because I don't have much to hold on to anymore. I don't want to hurt anyone but I'm tired of hurting."
1404,"Fucked up my life, lonely and hopeless","In January I fell into depression, dropped out of University and stopped keeping up with anybody. I don't really mind though, didn't like the place or the degree anyway, but it was the only place I was accepted to. Very certain that I have undiagnosed ADD, which prevented me from reaching my potential in high school and now I can't get into a Uni I actually want or even do well in the program I was in.

I just feel like I have nothing to live for. Well, I suppose that makes sense, since I'm not really living, just existing. I have no interests, no motivation, no purpose. During this year I have only left my home to buy food or visit my parents.  They still think I'm doing fine though, I haven't told the truth yet.

I have a doctor's appointment coming up soon, but even if I get help and pills that work, then what? I'm almost 23 and wasted my life inside playing video games. I'm behind my peers in everything, I don't have the experiences normal people my age in this country have. Even if I fix my life and get a degree I want, I'll be almost 30 when I graduate.  I'm going to be playing catch-up for the rest of my life. I wish I was dead tbh."
1405,I need fucking control of something,"I havent eaten since lunch time two days ago. I need to have control over something and food seems about right. I can’t continue acting like im fine. I need to have control over one thing in my life before I go fucking insane. 

I’m done with “going with the flow” and im done with acting like I’m all happy all the time. It’s getting harder and harder and I cant take it anymore.

I want to lose weight anyway so this seems like the perfect choice for me. Im already overweight so this better fucking make me look better. If it doesnt I don’t know what Im going to do."
1406,"January 30th, 2020.","I think that is when I will find peace. when I will finally be set free from this world. the 30th will give me time to celebrate the holidays, my 3rd month anniversary with my gf, and my 4 year friendship anniversary with someone close to me. I don't know what I will do. but before I pass on, I am going to find a notebook and write everything to everyone (or most people) I have known and pass on with that so whenever the police or whoever finds me gets to read it and get a sample of what went on in my mind. 

as much as I want to find hope, which I do believe I have found in certain things/people.. maybe it's best for me to move on to my next life/afterlife/where ever I may go. where ever I end up.. hopefully it's quiet there."
1407,I don’t know why I’m still alive,"I was able to tell that my mom never liked me since I was born. She’s always with my sister doing what a mom and daughter would do, while I’m always at home just thinking why she never wants to spend time with me. She yelled and hit me a lot as a kid and nothing I do seems good enough for her. I told her today what I wanted for Christmas which was some clothes which happened to be black. She then proceeded to scream at me saying I’m just gonna be a criminal and I’m nothing more than a school shooter because I enjoy playing video games. I’ve been crying for almost 2 hours and still why making this post. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t have anyone to talk to so I thought I should talk about it here."
1408,I'm so scared.,"I'm scared that's it's going to get worse. 

I wish I had someone who could comfort me but I don't. I'm so alone. I want to live but, I don't fee a future for myself. Everyday hurts. I'm only here because of my parents but at times I get tunnel vision and I forget about them and I only think about suicide. I just wish things were different. 

I just wish I was someone else."
1409,Asking for suggestions for my (hopefully not) final push to save my life,"Since I don't receive support from my family or friends, I really need any help with motivational suggestions to fight for my life because I am absolutely terrified. I'm really sorry about the long read, you can skip the ""background"" to get to the point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I am a 26-year-old male who has been struggling with depression/suicide for many years. (Diagnosed with severe depression in 2012 with two suicide attempts in 2015 and 2016). Every type of antidepressant I have tried has just made things worse. Therapists haven't really helped either as they usually just insist on me going on ""suicide watch"". I thought I had a pretty good handle on things, but recently, I am in serious trouble. I have severe sleep apnea, which I use a Bipap machine for, and I was diagnosed with narcolepsy (an incurable and degenerative disease), which has completely turned my life upside down as my condition gets worse and worse (it's increasingly difficult to stay awake). This has affected my ability to work as a mechanical engineer (I sometimes have to leave work early because I'm too tired or I'm on the verge of tears of frustration). I have been using prescribed adderall to keep me awake and to become numb to my depression along with weed to help me sleep and to go to bed ""happy"". I recently found out that a bunch of employees including the CEO and the head of HR have been constantly making fun of me for having to leave early even though I finish my work at night. They even refused a raise for me so I'm still living paycheck-to-paycheck. I live in an apartment in San Francisco with 3 other people who don't understand what I'm going through and who keep trashing the place, despite me asking them to help clean, which is significantly affecting my mood especially since I have OCD. Working out has been a huge help since it's directly correlated to my happiness, but because of the narcolepsy I'm getting too tired to keep at it, and I know it's only going to get worse. The narcolepsy/depression has also made it more difficult to maintain a social life - I have lost interest in dating and now my ""best friends"" won't even invite me to hang out with them anymore.

**Summary:** In summary, I'm stuck in a toxic work environment, in a toxic living environment, my family and I are not close at all, my friends are leaving me, traditional depression treatments don't work, my working out therapy is failing, I'm essentially doomed because of narcolepsy, and I have officially lost the will to live. The difference between now and the previous two suicide attempts is that I have thought and rationalized my death for so long and I am quite content with it as I fail to see the point to continue on living especially if my condition will just get worse and worse. Every single day is so difficult to get through, I truly hate myself and my situation, and I've never wanted to consistently end my life so badly. I plan on going out like a retired sports player by quitting my job, donating my money, deleting my social media accounts, finishing my already-started will, then ending it underneath the stars (astronomy is my most favorite thing).

**Assistance:** Before I choose to die, I want to make one last effort at the start of 2020. This includes finding a therapist who specializes in narcoleptic patients, completely quitting adderall and weed, aggressively job searching that hopefully leads to better pay so I can move out of this apartment, and forcing myself to workout every day. If you guys have any suggestions on mood trackers, therapeutic tips like the ""cold shower method"", or anything else to help me in my last pursuit of happiness, I would be forever grateful. Please, help me. There's a little bit of me that's not ready to die yet."

1411,An interesting title,"This fucking sucks, I don't want to die, I truly don't. But, this world and environment is toxic and inhumane. Good people get put in situations that they don't deserve, and bad people get to live and love. If anyone that knows me sees this, congratulations, you were a dick to me, but I don't blame you, I love everything with a soul. I suggest everyone else do the same."
1412,Trying to decide how to do it.,"I'm...leaning towards using a noose I made in my garage. It's just a steel cable hung from the rafters, but its meant to hold over 800 lbs.

The only other options at hand would be an overdose of alcohol/benzos or opening my wrists - neither of which seem nearly as certain of success."
1413,Reflection on my suicide attempt,"On the 13th of November 2019, at the age of 14,I tried to kill myself.It’s been almost exactly a month since then and I’m grappled with these strange, conflicting feelings and emotions. On one hand, I still have trouble understanding that it happened. It doesn’t feel real, in a strange way. It’s like I’m not sure how to handle the fact that what I did was incredibly serious and real. On the other hand, it also feels like nothing special, in a way. Like it was just another day in my sad life. Just another incident. A minor setback of no importance. These thoughts somehow manage to co exist in my mind with no real trouble. It’s quite odd.

In a way, even if I didn’t die, I got what I wanted. As I sat there in my school bathroom with a blade to my arm, I knew that if I survived (which I knew was likely), things would still improve in a way. I would have to torture myself with my family’s reaction but they would realise just how bad things have gotten. So if my attempt failed, things would still change for the better.

I often wonder if I still want to die. If I found myself at the edge of a cliff with certain death at the bottom would I jump? The more i fantasise about it, the more I long for it. Staring at death in the face with open arms, the absoluteness of knowing you’re about to die. It’s morbidly peaceful. Like there’s nothing in the world but you and only you. Despite this, I don’t think I want to die at this point in time.
I will likely be put in inpatient soon but that’s what I always wanted. And of course, my mind won’t let me die till I figure out my autism situation to see if I have it or not. I’ve managed to cling onto hope for now. For the first time in a while, my destiny doesn’t seem like suicide"
1414,I’m gonna try it,I honestly have nothing to look forward to anymore so I’m going to attempt suicide because I don’t really have anything left to keep doing this for sorry to people who really care but it’s over it’s been nice letting you people try to help but unfortunately I’m kind of fucked at this point
1415,Lost,"Hi guys,

This past year has been a rollercoster of emotions. At the end, I’m still thinking about suicide and I’m not afraid to do it... The only thing keeping me from doing it is my mom. I know eventually I’ll do it but for now I need help.

Do you guys have things that keep you from killing yourself? I just need other reasons to live for my mother just a little longer..."
1416,Without hope...what is there?,"I don't know what to do any more.

I've felt hope was distant for some time - elusive, but not nonexistent. 

Between my mental illnesses spiraling, my finances failing, and the last person I felt truly connected to warning that my depressive issues were too much...

It feels like suicide is my only option.

The only times I've gotten to this bleak of a mindset before? I at least felt a raw, desperate sense of fear at having that thought. But right now I don't feel afraid - just empty and hollow.

I'm trying to think of what words I should leave in my wake, but none come to me."
1417,I don’t want to die,But I feel like I have no choice. I’m Almost 16 and  I feel so numb to everything I know it sounds crazy but I feel like I have to kill myself I know it won’t get any better.everyday it’s the only thing on my mind is that I don’t deserve to be here anymore and that I need to go it scares me so much.
1418,I’m a complete waste of space.,"Is it alright to end my life before Christmas? I stopped my medication incase it interferes with my chosen method. I should be able to die on Thursday or Wednesday.

I would love to die tonight or tomorrow. 

Will be a bit anxious and guilty but what’s the point in trying for others when I hurt everyone around me 

Just before Christmas isn’t a very nice notion but I’m done holding on, been a long 12 years of dealing with the pain. I’ll leave my parents some money to pay for the cremation."
1419,I’m going to kill myself T if you don’t marry me and live on top of me 24/7.,
1420,Almost there and i dont think anything is going to stop me,"Hi all

Im gonna kill myself soon but i dont want to. Im 21 years old and Im supposed to graduate college soon but I would rather just end my life before i get there. 

I dont know how to explain it without getting into specifics but I just cant really live anymore. I feel so empty being around my friends now, i have a good number of them and I think theyre good friends but it feels like when Im around them they dont wanna be around me. Im not really a priority to any of them and every time ive made it clear that im going through something, most of them just do fuckall. And when i reach out, I cant talk to them because it doesnt really feel like theyre listening to me. Or sometimes I talk and i feel like Im putting too much on them. Or sometimes I start talking and they immediately want to change the subject or get me to shut up. Its hard to really explain and I feel like no matter which way I try to explain it, its gonna come across wrong. Idk

Im graduating soon and in my field there is an expectation to move out somewhere soon if not immediately, because to do so otherwise would cause you to fall behind in a field full to the brim with ageism and nepotism. Im pretty good at what I do but it sometimes feels like my worth is entirely tied to that. Not that I view my own worth that way, but other people only really seem to care about me when Im putting out good work at a consistent rate. Otherwise it seems like they dont want anything to do with me. 

And then im just really lonely in general, I dont really have a family because my dad is an immature, short-tempered alcoholic. I cant talk to him about anything without him escalating it into yelling (for literally no reason). My mom is a neurotic unhinged narcissist who spent my entire childhood exploding over the smallest things and screaming at me until I was a blubbering sobbing mess. Im not exaggerating. She does this to my younger sisters who live at home even today. 

I dont have a girlfriend but honestly it doesnt feel like that should matter to me. It does matter to me a lot and i really wish i had someone to love (especially because the vast majority of my friends are in committed, long term relationships) but the only relationship I've ever had was with a girl who dumped me after 2 months. This was earlier this year and it triggered a months long depressive episode that all my friends basically ignored me during. I really really struggled with dating before that and I have always been afraid that I would be abandoned very quickly in my first relationship and thats what happened. I thought i'd done everything right and was being a good boyfriend but i guess not. It doesnt feel worth it to try anymore. Ive tried dating again since then but every time i think something might go somewhere i immediately start crying and throwing up and i think about killing myself again. I dont think i should be in a relationship and i would probably have been happier if i had given up for real after that breakup.

I cant go to therapy or get help because i cant afford it on my own and I cant get help from my family. I dont have a car and honestly i just dont really like being alive anymore. Ive been sad all the time (minus the 2 months i was with that girl) for probably 2 straight years now and its just too much. Even if things get better, theyre gonna get worse again and I dont ever want to live through something like this again. Maybe im just being dramatic or weak, but i guess if i cant survive real life like this at 21 i probably shouldnt be trying to live it much longer honestly. 

Theres a gun store just a 15 minute walk up the street from where I live. I live in a state with few gun laws and it would only take an hour to go in and out. Theres a park relatively close by where I can call the police first so my roommate doesnt have to find me. I know how much pain its gonna cause to the people around me and I wish i knew how to save them from that pain. But i figure that eventually they will recover from it, they have to because they're not gonna have a choice. I'm making this choice for me and no one else. I guess that sounds harsh but I dont owe anyone my life"
1421,If I could I'd swap places with someone on that Malaysia Airlines or germanwings plane,"Those people didn't deserve to die but I do and I wish I could go back and swap places with one of them. Crashing into a mountain or dying of hypoxia would be an easier death and they could carry on their lives and I could get my wish by fading off into the sunset. I think its unfair that people who want to live suffer horrible deaths while those who don't are stuck here living crappy lives.

Sadly there are no unreliable airlines here so the chances of it ever happening to me are slim :("
1422,I don't want to live anymore,"I started to have these feelings since middle school,(I'm 20 now). It just feels like everybody is out to be mean to me. I can rarely go out to public because of all the mockery, and a matter of fact today an old man thought I was a thief because I wore a hoodie and a hat he thought I pocketed something when I was really just getting my wallet out real quick so he gave the store employee a description of me. And no it's not just that either I can't make any friends I'm shy and the friends I do make always seem to stop hanging out with me. I will never find a relationship, my whole life I was made fun of for being ugly, even teachers were pricks to me . no one ever gives the time of day to asks how the quiet guy is feeling, because deep down we all kinda wish someone was there for us. But why should I live in a world that doesn't want me.ive tried therapy, that did me no good, therapy can't fix what life gives you in return, there's a lot more reasons but I've gone on long enough."
1423,Same old,"Hi. First of all I want to say thank you all for giving people encouragement and words of support when they post here in their time of need.
Personally, I have no clue what to do with my life to feel like I've progressed or succeeded. After all the hard work and education I'm working in a store, grinding my life away like the rest of us. I feel like I have lost my passion and don't really want to continue living if I'm acting fake and feeling miserable every day.
If you are also suicidal and reading this, I believe you can pull through. I don't have the energy to fight my feelings and at this point they feel like my identity and I honestly don't really want them to go away. I think if anyone wants to hard enough they have a chance at getting better. 
Good luck."
1424,i feel like everything is falling apart around me and i dont know what to do,"these feel like such small problems but im sitting here by myself and i wish i just wasnt here.

my friend pressured me to take drugs and play strip poker a month ago, i confided in a friend and she told others and they all approached him about it. he called me and gave out to me for telling everyone and said he’s sick of me, and now none of my friends are speaking to me.

on top of this this guy i was with, his friend kissed me in front of me whilst we were drunk without my consent. i said “dont” but no one heard and now the guy i was getting with isnt speaking to me and said he doesnt want to see me anymore.

now tonight, all of them are together, my friends and the guy. theyre all hanging out and no one is speaking to me anymore. im a college drop out who doesnt have a job, i have no one to talk to. I called a suicide hotline but im already starting to hate myself again. everything seems to be my fault and i feel like a curse to everyone i meet and the world would be better off if i wasnt here. i dont know what to do anymore, i feel so lost and fuck i dont even know.

im sorry if this is stupid i just wanted to put this somewhere so someone would know about it all. i want to go to bed so badly im so tired. as edgy as it sounds i just want to go to sleep and never wake up"
1425,What are things you should do in the days leading up to your suicide?,
1426,Do you think that if you had a gun you would be alive right now?,Serious question. Real answers only
1427,Help please,"So life is basically perfect but I still wanna die is there anything I can do to at least cope with it .so last year I had the worse year of my life and fucked mentally it’s a really long story, ever since then at least every week I get in a mood where i get a serious urge to kms and anxious about literally everything. I wanna live but if this keeps happening I won’t for long probably sounds really stupid but that’s how it is."
1428,"I've decided I'm going to put an end to this on new year's eve. I know I will make many people suffer, and I want to balance it out by helping others in need before I go.","2 months ago I utterly destroyed with my own hands the relationship I had with the person I loved more than anyone else. It's completely my fault, I've tried to make it right but she now sees me as a monster, even though I changed my whole life for the better.

I have fixed myself, changed almost everything that was wrong with me, but she still hates me and can't forgive me. I don't blame her for that. She was my lover and my best friend for years, yet I betrayed her trust in the worst way possible. I still love her too much, and I see that it's not getting better by the day, I can notice that my whole life and attitude are getting better, but not how I feel towards her, if anything I miss her more with every day passing.

I've already made preparations for it, it's not my first attempt, but it's the first time I plan for it with a cold mind, so I think I will finally go through with that, and it gives me a sense of relief from all this pain and loneliness. 

I've chosen to help others in distress before I leave this place, so I will dedicate my last days here not seeking help for myself but giving it to others, as I'm sure sometimes people just need someone who really can understand them, as too many times I read the same exact phrases her from people wanting to help (And I know you probably really want to help, but most of us already know that there are other ways, and the fact that we will make our families suffers already haunts us enough without you telling us), when something I learned while being suicidal is that you have to solve the root causes of it, otherwise it is just pushing it further down the line.

In my case, I've come to see that the root of my suicidal thoughts just doesn't want to hear from me, and I'm gonna respect that, I will leave her alone, she doesn't know I'm going to end my life, nor is my intention to let her know and ruin hers, if everything goes as planned she will not know about it anytime soon.

Sorry if the post is kind of a mess, but it reflects my mental state at the moment.

TL;DR: I'm gonna end my life on new year's eve, if you need to talk with someone who can understand you about how you feel, I would be more than happy to spend my last days helping you! I you need a friend, go on and contact me, I may not be here for long but I promise I will make you feel loved! So feel free to PM me!"
1429,It actually happened... I made it to 21,"I’ve made shitty posts in the past during my lows but for once I’m hopeful. Ever since losing my apartment and boyfriend, things started looking up when I moved in with my aunt. It wasn’t in my plans at all, but holy shit did it work out for the better.

Ever since I was younger, I knew I didn’t see a future for myself. Now that uncertainty doesn’t haunt me anymore. Losing the love of my life made me realize the downs of that relationship we’re not worth holding out for with all the good it brought. A fresh start from what I thought was one ended being what I needed.

So, in sharing this, I hope it can help some of you in situations you feel you can’t get out of. All I’m asking is that you hold on. Take advantage of ways that give your inner turmoil an outlet (creative expressions, hobbies, events, hanging out with friends, small but honest chat with people), and don’t ignore opportunities that may seem scary but can get you away from toxicity in your life. Do what is best for you.

A little over three years ago, I didn’t think I’d make it to 18, then I doubted I’d hit 20, and now I’m here. Though patience may not seem like a virtue for some of you, I can tell you that it’ll be worth it. Even yesterday, I was having some suicidal idealization because I couldn’t believe I was going to make it to my 21 when I felt sure I wouldn’t.

I will admit, I’m still scared being alive, but the feeling that comes when I look back at all I’ve been through compared to where I’m at now, it’s something I hope you can have. You all deserve to feel it.  Just do what you can now to pull through the bullshit. Remember you’re not alone and I believe in you when no one else will.

TL;DR Some good things in life are worth losing when it has bad parts. Fresh starts may be scary but they’re worth taking on. And everything takes time because looking back will be one of the best feelings knowing you made it out."
1430,"Thinking about taking months of medications, what will happen?","I have over 3000mg of Mirtazapine and 5000 Effexor XR. I also have a lot of Advil and Tylenol. What will this do, will I throw it up or die?"
1431,To anyone reading this who has someone to love in their lives....,"Please tell them you love them. 

For me. 

It doesn't have to be a big thing; just buy them a little chocolate, give them a compliment you wouldn't otherwise, just make their day better. I'll be dying in some days because I can't be loved. And I will never be able to love someone the way I want to.   


I can't say I blame anyone but myself (and my family) for making me unlovable. Its not anyone's fault. It seems almost right, in a way; why should any girl have to go through the pain of me in their lives?  


Anyway, that'll all be taken care of soon, my fate will be sealed and so will that of my lovely hypothetical imaginary love.  


But if yours isn't imaginary, then go tell them, *show* them that you love them and they have all the right in the world to love you back.  


Your love is a very precious little thing, and I know its not my place to intrude on it, but I really, really, really would appreciate if you let it affect the world around you; make it a better place. I couldn't live a life where I knew what it was like to be loved, please don't ever let those you truly care about feel that way."
1432,I think I'll be at peace,"I've hit rock bottom.

My dad's a criminal, my mom has just gotten evicted, abusive relationships all around; it's clear what I have to do. 

Tonight, this very night, December 14th, 2019, will be my last night here.

I will slit my wrists, and anywhere else I can and take some sleeping pills.

I know people care, I know there are other options, but they've never worked for me. This is what I need to do to be free.

I know that it's not the best way by any means, but I've done research on death, what it feels like, and other things.

I'm ready. No backing out. No stopping.

12:00 am will be my time.

It is 3:18 pm as I post this.

Nobody can change my mind."
1433,I don't want to live anymore and I don't want any help,"If a car is completely broken, you wouldn't try to somehow fix it just a little bit, so it will survive another winter and then fix it again. 
This is what our society does: We can't watch you die so we'll help and fix you so you can at least somehow go on. What happened after it: Don't care.

If I keep on going, I'm gonna be a half functional computer engineer, who will be completely alone and will have nothing besides the job (and Netflix).
But this would work for anyone else. 
 
This is so fucking ridiculous and devastating. 
I can't take anymore"
1434,I just don't want to be alone anymore,"We talked every day these last few months. She made me feel safe and loved and wanted. She made me feel like a human being. I never felt that before. 

My father left me, my family never showed my any love, I've never been socially adept enough to form a connection with anyone. 

We talked every day these last few months. We met online and immediately felt a connection. We talked about everything and nothing, about how much we wanted to see each other. But I never got together the money to go see her. 

The first girl I loved didn't love me back. Neither did the second. Both occupied my mind for months after, I wanted to die, I hurt myself, I got substance abuse issues.

We talked every day these last few months. Except the last two weeks, I was stressed because of school and didn't message her, and unlike earlier times she didn't message me either. 

Today I messaged her and she told me she met someone else. 

And I wanted to talk to someone about how I felt, but then I realized I only wanted to talk to her. 

We talked every day these last few months, and then she left me, like every one else did."
1435,I know I must die before this month ends.,
1436,Why should I tell people I'm planning to kill myself if I REALLY want to die?,"I am tired. Me threatening to commit suicide all the time is nothing but annoying to the people around me. I know the consequences of telling people I have a plan. They'll just hospitalize me and make sure I don't hurt myself. So if I *really* want to die, shouldn't I just shut up about it and pretend I don't have a plan so no one can stop me? Telling them means that I'm not 100% serious about dying. It would be pure attention seeking, right?"
1437,Chronic pain and accusations of hypochondria have turned me into a sociopath,"I began to have chronic pain 1 year ago and my family and doctors have been extremely cruel towards me regarding it ever since as a result I have become bitter angry and my memory is filled with fantasies of violent retribution on those who hurt me.

5 years ago when I was 16 years old I started to lose my memory so I went to the hospital to get help and was misdiagnosed multiple times before being diagnosed with psychosis. The doctors and my family all claimed that my memory loss was a delusion and if I ever spoke about my memory loss I was threatened with involuntary hospitalization and forcefully medicated with injections.

now a few months ago **it has been discovered by a neurologist that I was right** and that I do indeed have memory problems so I have been diagnosed with pseudo dementia and memory loss is no longer a delusion.

My cognitive ability is constantly deteriorating and my memory loss gets worse every few weeks, recently I have been waking up extremely angry and I smashed a hole through a solid wood door and sent out hate mail to my mental health counselors.

Meanwhile my family and people around continue to accuse me of hypochondriasis regularly while my unbearable pain from shortness of breath which has lasted since July 2018 continues."
1438,December 31st right before midnight,"I am doing it, just before the new year"
1439,"Theres a few things I need to ""hide"" away 1st (not illegal) that kinda stop me","Maybe it's stupid but I guess it's like having to get your affairs in order.

Well there's a few things in my house that I need to box up and label correctly as I don't want my parents finding them. 

And that is what kind of stops me. 

That and I don't want to hurt my family or my ex. I can't bear the thought of hurting her... but the pull of it gets stronger by the minute."
1440,Loneliness kills,"And it's slowly killing me. A person cannot live only focused of studies... Every single day, it burns."
1441,Exit bag,"I cant seem to find solid information when it comes to making these witch is silly because from the sounds of it, its pretty simple. Im sure i could rig one up however im trying to not wake up from some stupid minor mistake i should have known to look out for. For example i have no idea how much gas i need nor how to set or what to set the flow to as i assume if its too fast or too slow it will fuck something up. I know i need to exhale everything from my lungs before fitting my head in the bag and inhaling.  I just want to make sure i do this right.
Thank you."

1444,Breakdowns :(,Whenever I have a breakdown and talk to someone during it I always feel disgusted with myself afterwards. Like I just feel weak and embarrassed for opening up to someone. I always regret it. I don’t know why
1445,Started from the top now I’m here.,"The absolute worst part about life is living. I fall short on everything I do. I use to be better than this. But then I decided to become a junkie. And then I never stopped that because I’m weak. So then it consumed my mind and took over my thoughts. And the person who once was no longer was.  The worst part is I feel like I’m in a mental purgatory where I can see the person I once was, I can see who I’ve become, however I can’t do anything about it. Think of the “sunken place” in get out. I’m just stuck in this financial rut. I don’t see a purpose to continue to live, below Poverty. Ashamed of who I am. Embarrassed to even be seen in public. I am nothing, a  nobody and completely disposable. Replaceable and invaluable. I hope I get the courage to pull this trigger soon."

Idk what to do, but when somehow ""get rid of it"" somebody in school or somewhere else have to tell me that ""I'm short"", ""Worthless"", ""Dwarf ""(btw I live in relative tall country and normal height for male here is about 181-182cm) or smh that makes me feel sad, kinda depressed or smh. But I don't real friends who can I confess to without making fun of me... My grades are great, I know what I want to be in a future but still idk what to do."
1448,Everything goes wrong for me :(,"I feel horrible. I’m lonely, scared and sad. I thought I had support from my family. But, It seems I was wrong. I honestly feel much worse after talking to them. They make me feel useless, hopless, very scared. They make me feel like my life is meaningless. I’m a Nobody and I will always be a nobody. My life will be getting worse and worse, according to them. It’s breaking my heart. I have a few friends. But, They are very busy. I end up crying in the nights. I have no one to talk to :(  


I hope and wish everyone a good day :)"
1449,"A ""logical"" decision","I lost everything, and the future for me is hopeless. In the span of 2 years - I lost my figure, my physical health, the love of my life, the place in PhD course, job prospects, my most treasured friendships, my independence, my last shred of self-esteem or self-belief. Everything that was good in my life or gave me hope for the future - it all went to shit. I genuinely don't see how it can all be fixed / rebuilt, neither do I have the physical energy or the mental resources needed to even begin to fix this.

This is not an emotional decision, this is logical. I'm not depressed at this moment, at least not severely (I've been seriously depressed before, and this is not it). That's why I believe I'm making a rational decision to end my life. Haven't decided on a specific date yet, but it will be sometime after the holidays."
1450,"I used to hate the idea of suicide, now it seems like the best option",A year ago if you asked me if I wanted to kill myself I would’ve told you that there is no way I would ever even think about committing suicide. A year later and I think about it daily. I constantly feel like that it is my best and only option. I don’t how much longer I will last before I completely give up.
1451,This world is mean and nasty. I’m officially leaving it tomorrow; everything is already laid out. ✌️,
1452,Today’s the day,"Throw away account
Where I live it’s currently 3:00 and tonight imma  take a ton of acetaminophen and drink some liquor. I feel that this would work considering I’m only 15. I just have no reason to live, my family doesn’t care about me. I have no friends at school and I’m constantly getting detention and already a suspension. None of the teachers like me at school. My crush fucking hates my guts and my dog whom I loved passed recently. I just wanted to say goodbye to someone, anyone. Life isn’t fair."
1453,I can't anymore,"The reason of my suicidal thoughts coke from overall feeling like a total piece of shit, I can't recall ever being useful, I'm shit talking to girls, never had a girlfriend, can't fit in my new high school class, keep getting memories from 9th grade which was the most depressive year ever, my parents treat me like a fucking baby, almost everyday I try to go out not to deal with their shit, today I didn't and they took me 2 km away from my house and made me walk home alone making me feel depressed as shit(I overthink A LOT). Whats the point in living if I'm just going to suffer, why not just end it. Help please."
1454,i can’t stop thinking about dying and it hurts so fucking bad,"i have a plan that could work to kill me and i want to do it but i also don’t want to do it. i have sleeping pills so maybe i should just take those and fall asleep now but it’s quarter past 7pm. i had new anti-anxiety + anti-depression medication but i started feeling bad after taking it so i stopped taking it on orders from the doctor but maybe i should take it and just like,, see what happens?? i just have no fucking idea dude"
1455,it gets better and then it gets worse,"i just have to lay here and try not to think, because if i start thinking, the thoughts are all bad, and the longer i think the worse the thoughts get. so im just laying here, waiting for the day to end.

i hate myself and i think about ending it. ive been thinking about it since high school. there will be stretches of a few weeks maybe where the thoughts go away--usually for some personal reason--and then they come back and its months of self pity and despair again.

i know it gets better. but then it gets worse again. and its worse more often than its better. i think why get out of bed after 5 hours if ill be back in 30 minutes, and i think why be happy after 5 months if ill be sad in a week.

i know the cycle. how many times am i going see it out?"
1456,Why doesn't anyone like me?,"All my life I've never had that many friends. I've always been involved in different sports, clubs and activities and I'm really social and love to talk to other people. But why is it that nobody wants to talk to me? I feel crushed and upset at myself because nobody seems to want to talk to me. I'm a cheerleader at my school and even they don't talk to me. I feel worthless."
1457,to everyone who lost someone to suicide: how do you cope?,"it's been almost 4 months since my best friend's death. there are episodes when i can handle it relatively fine. and then there are episodes like now when i'm overcome with this unbearable sadness and hopelessness. it kicks in suddenly and out of nowhere and stays for quite a while.
it doesn't help that i had suicidal episodes myself in the past.

to everyone who also lost a friend: did you manage to find a way to cope with the sadness that comes every now and then?"
1458,Drowning in December snow,"Yesterday night was terrible. I couldn't fell asleep. And I had bad Insomnia. Was getting really overwhelmed with suicide thoughts. Went threw my life and all the memories, all the opportunities left behind. And all the bad decisions I have taken in those 25 years.

I couldnt stop thinking of it, I felt like shit. And how all the people look down on me. And that I am utterly worthless. How my family is disappointed of me. Had been studying but just couldnt see myself and did drop out, altho I had good grades. And I done that twice.

Now I had this job that was draining me out, and my depression was getting deeper and deeper. So I decided to quit it, and went for one month traveling UK. I returned and still a mess, still depressed and mostly just sleeping all days.

So yesterday I went threw it all. And gave myself a date. After New year. I have a birthday in January, and I said to myself I dont want to turn 26. So it has to be before january 11! I was thinking what to dress, to get a clean shave, eat something good and to go somewhere in nature. I was thinking to go somewhere in alps, because I live near. Buy some pain killers and a razor and open my wrist somwhere idyllic.

Then I woke up this morning and couldnt ditch the idea, cried for some time. Didnt go out of bed, just slept and slept. It felt al just so decided. But was struggling against it, was active on reddit. Tried to cheer up another user. And posted some compliments on selfie section(xD).  Kicked my anxiety in the balls and went to take a walk. Altho it was terrible, atleast it helped me that we have short days now and it felt somehow easier with the low light.

Now in the evening I am a liitle bit more relax, listening to the burning snowflakes. Had some hot tea. Talked with few people and getting there. Mellowed for a short while."
1459,I dont want to exist anymore,The breeders have trapped me here. I didnt consent to being born. They could have aborted me and i wouldnt have this problem. So i might have to do it myself but it could be real messy. I could fail.
1460,I failed again to kill myself but I'll do it tomorrow. And I hope I would be gone.,"I have done selfharm too much.. and last week I tried to kill myself but I failed. 
I still want to die . I really want to die.. 
I decided to keep doing this until I can be gone. 
I'm sorry my son. When I think about him, I think I should live for him. But it doesn't change my suicide thoughts. 
No one will take care of my son without me if I'm gone. That makes me feel so sad . 
I'm very struggling and suffering. Because I'm so alone. People say very easily that I should try to get some help like to professionals. I am tired of listening that. If they helped me, I would be okay now. They were so useless for me tbh. 
I'll try to kill myself again tomorrow.. I hope it will be successed"
1461,"It's the only thing I want from the bottom of my heart, and there's no one in this world who would validate my true feelings.","I feel so burdened to have to live just because it would destroy my family or another involuntary hospitalization or a fear of failed attempt making me unlivable and worse off than I am right now. I lost all of my personality and emotions. I don't want to live, death is the only thing I've wanted truly for the past two years. But I always come up with excuses at the last moment. My death is going to be just as meaningless as my life. I envy people who kill themselves at first thought. I am just so weak I can't even kill myself even when I don't want to live. This monday there's a new brain stimulation treatment which is starting, if this doesn't work I swear to god I would kill myself before January ends or even starts. I do not deserve to live a compromised life. It's time this chapter ends."
1462,Barely moving,"No one is going to read this, I will give back story. I’m a deaf and cerebral palsy person that has no car or on SSI. I have always been looking for the best city and state for someone like me. I was trapped in moving to WV. It was hard finding a place to live. I’m under Section 8. 

The shit hit the fan, when I asked a “friend” to come see an apartment with me. It had small windows, no carpet and was very big. I did voice my concerns, but she acted like those concerns were no big deal. Instead, she sold me to get it.  I did and had no idea, that I made the biggest and stupidest decision ever. It has cracks on the floor and under the apartment. It has spiders, roaches, lizards, mice (2 so far) and who knows what else. No washer/dryer. The nearest food store will cost me $21 each round trip using Uber and you can’t pay with food stamps online. Since, the windows are small, you have to leave light on a lot. Since, it is big, you have to waste money on a lot of rugs. 

Knowing I signed a year lease in this place, I have went down the hill fast. I have not washed my clothes for 3 months, no washer/dryer and no car. I haven’t bath in more than 2 weeks. I eat 1 meal a day and the apartment looks like a tornado hit. I have tried everything to distract myself. I wrote fan fiction 3 different “books,” now, I don’t care. I tried adding wallpaper that peels and sticks, not work. I have no idea how to survive, when I am trapped in this “hell” for 10 more months. I, honestly, don’t think I am going to survive. I have no friends or family close by. 

I am glad people are not reading my fan fiction “books,” so I can just barely exist in life. The “friend” is shocked that I deleted her from my life. To me, any person that would recommend this place is not a true friend. How people survive these kind of things are beyond me. If you say life gets better, please don’t. It won’t get better until I amount of here, which won’t be until October 2020. So, that’s a long time for life to get better. A human can only stay strong for so long. I’m wondering how long I can. But, the way things are going, it doesn’t look good."
1463,"It's not the problems that make me want to die, it's that I've been a bad person","Im selfish, greedy, spoiled, lying no good scum, who hides out here on Reddit. It's not about being sad, mad, depressed, etc. That stuff is independent of the bad things I've done and said to/about others. Somehow people have wanted me around, but it's weird that they can't see how much their lives are better without me being around. 

Pretty much waiting until they are apathetic, which is coming up soon. I've got the 'how', but am waiting for the 'when'"
1464,I’m done with life,"I’ve lost the will and desire to live anymore. My girlfriend and I of almost 4 years broke up. We have a 2 year old son, a car and an apartment together. Half of my world is gone and I don’t know what to do anymore. I pay 80% of the bills and if I were to move out she and my son would have no where to go as she works only part time and has no drivers license and diploma to get a better job. I feel like a stranger in my house, we talk only about our son and that’s it. I just can’t believe that she is unwilling to work on our relationship, I never liked quitting in a relationship aspect, she states nothing will work but you don’t know unless you try. I would understand if we dated for a couple of months of a year but we have so much together that I can’t fathom tossing everything away like she does. I begged and cried to give our relationship another chance but to no avail. I’m in so much pain. I feel worthless and just unloved. I have never felt this way before in my life. I want the pain to go away forever. I don’t want to do this to my son but I can’t continue living like this anymore. I’m better off not existing any longer... I plan on not going into the new year alive."
1465,My toxic home environment is slowly killing me.,"I don't know what to do anymore. Or what to say. So much has happened to me this past year. And it's all because of my family. They are the reason I want to die. I'm okay when I'm not at home. I feel as if maybe life isn't so bad. Maybe I can get through this, but as soon as I get home reality hits. I hate existing among these people. Even if they are my family. I mean I love my family but I hate them at the same time. Nobody has caused me as much pain as they have. I've never been in a situation where a person makes me want to kill myself but here I am. I just can't stand to live here anymore. I feel like I'd be okay if I had my own place. But I'm just a kid. I'm barely out of high school. If I had the fucking money I'd leave. That's why I just want to end it all. The pain, the suffering. I just want to be extinct. I want it to be like I never existed. I'm just so tired. So fucking tired of it all. Sorry for the rant."
1466,To my parents,"I've been hiding from my parents with these feelings. The only time they found my cuts they didnt make sure i was ok (menatlly) ,they rambled about how much they did for me (wich deepend my hate). This night, im just going to take a knife and cut bot sides of my neck, twice and maybe my wrists. Hope they sleep tight.
If you know  any reason this might not work please tell me."
1467,It's My Stepdad,"How the hell can one man, not an army nor swindler, drive to past the point of no return? 

Everyday, no matter what I do, he hates me. It is partially my fault, but it's too extreme for me alone. I am constantly ostracized in my family as is, but he makes it worse a-tenfold.

So, I plan on killing myself. I want to write the not blaming him, though he is only one reason in an ocean, he is the predominant factor. However, I feel like that would just make him feel too bad. He doesn't know how to listen, and this is my last resort. Tips?"
1468,Loneliness,"I've noticed many people here are very lonely. Myself included. I've been dealing with depresson and anxiety for over a decade. So bad I'm on disability. I've lost everyone aside from a few family members and a friend that lives hours away. Is there a discord or something of the sort where people chat? Additionally if you just want to talk or need a friend, hit me up. I'm not the best at small talk but I'll try. We all have to start somewhere. If you do message me don't take it personally if i don't get back right away! 20+ please. Enjoy your day."
1469,"I really want to die, but feel like I can't say it. (crosspost from r/depression_help)"," 

So  I've been suicidal for 7-8 years, have a plan, have access to the plans  mean of suicide but every-time I mention it the cops/ambulance are  called. I take 30mg Diazepam +180mg pregabalin +12mg buprenorphrine /  day. Only the buprenorphine is on a script, the others were prescribed  but cut-off about 4 years ago, since then I've been using the darknet  for the diazepam and pregabalin. It is proper medication sourced from  spain, with leaflets everything (I even sent some samples to Energy  Control and they came back fine, 100% what it says on the box).

Right  now, my GP, my drug-worker, my psych are all aware of this (me buying  illegally from the darknet and giving zero shits) but I mentioned I'm  feeling suicidal to my drug-worker (pretty much as always), and a CRISIS  team was told about it. They called and setup an appointment that I  went to today.

My worries are that  in the past, ambulance/police teams have turned up to my house and take  all my illegal diaz/pregabs (I have no ill-will towards the cops, they  have to). But it forces me through a 72+hour withdrawal until I can  place another order and see the psych team who just ask;

""Are you suicidal?, are you going to kill youself today? No? Okay you can go"".

So now I'm feeling like I shouldn't tell anyone, thoughts?"
1470,"It's stupid to kill yourself over grades, right?","Heads Up: I'm not in the process of killing myself, just have moments where I wonder if I should, so if you're on serious, serious suicide watch, I don't blame you for moving on.

I want to avoid a long post, so I will creatively outline my whole life in single sentences.

//////////-START-///////////

\- Always had mental issues, not too bad, mostly just translated to a lot of creative thought.

\- Homeschooled with my 3 siblings (5th kid came later); my mom is literally a superhero.

\- We did homeschool co-ops in highschool (think small private school offering some classes) so I wasn't completely isolated from the outside world.

\- I was diagnosed as bipolar at 16 (what a number, huh) and given low dosages.

\- Graduated highschool at 17 with great grades that I earned and then went to a big ole state college (go pack?).

\- Smoke weeeed ere'day (okay like 3 times/week at peak), but I was still a good student. Started getting really analytical and paranoid though...

\- Second semester sophomore year: A C I D. Stopped smoking weed though.

\- Cheated on my girlfriend, and told her while tripping. (Worst choice I ever made. Literally the worst. Thought it would be alright. It was NOT. I will never regress. It was just a \*BAD\* \*CHOICE\*. Not who I am.). Tripped straight into hell during that time.

\- After pleading and pleading, she forgave me (she is also a superhero btw), and we have been happy since. I really do love her with every single atom in my body.

\- I proposed last summer (I'm only 19) and we plan on getting married next summer after dating for 3yrs.

\- Over the summer + this semester I dealt with the kickback of the acid stint and I lost touch with reality.

\- Along with a tripped, tormented, twisted mind-world, I dealt with depression and mania from my bipolar. Meditation was a HUGE help, but I didn't realize that till the end of the semester.

\- I bombed the semester; never did so bad in school. ever. The semester's grades are basically worthless.

\- I just want to take a semester break (I will go back. I love what I'm doing. I want to get my degree.), but I don't think I can do that and finish school in time. I'm a semester ahead of the curve, but I can't afford to take a semester off school, then retake all my classes.

\- I have never felt so close to suicide as these last few weeks. Everything is bleak and overwhelming and I hate it. I never get out the notebook and plot, but I find serious thoughts of suicide are enough reason for concern.

\- Recap: My brain is recovering from being an idiot. I want time off from school. I want to go to grad school after. But my grades are abysmal and might mar both of those possibilities.

////////////-END-///////////

Okay I lied. Those all weren't single sentences. And this is a long post. But congratulations if you read this far; you are a friend (if you skipped through, then you're not my friend and can't have any of my birthday cake humph....just kidding we can still be friends).

//////////////-NOW-/////////////

It's the end of the semester and I'm trying to do damage control on my grades. I see them. I see my life mapped out in front of me. I see how I fucked it up, and I fucked myself up and I don't even have time to recover. I don't want a repeat of last semester. I want to be more stable entering into marriage (don't tell me to put it off; my partner has been the most helpful, encouraging person in my life). I want to go to grad school. But now those things feel farther away. And I can't do anything about them but stumble on like a donkey with a broken leg (how fitting an analogy). If I had time to rest this semester, I feel like I could fix myself (really into Jungian psychology), but there ain't no rest for the wicked (but hmu I know this dude who says he has money that grows on a tree).

I can't help but look at my grades, look at my head, look at my life and feel like I just fucked up. I know it's early in life, but isn't that the most effective time to fuck up? It's stupid to kill myself over my grades. I'm just trying to keep that attitude.

Please help reddit. Just some words of encouragement, advice on my situation, rebuke, just anything. I need to tell this to another human being (sure therapists have heard bits and pieces but here we still are). I just want to feel like I'm not some deadbeat, nutcase, screwup that ruined everyone's lives and their own. Maybe that's how I should feel. Idk.

\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;TL;DR: Bad grades are the culmination of a hurricane of life events and I feel overwhelmed&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

btw, I love you. (that's for you reading to the end)."
1471,"Words someone told me, maybe they can kinda help you too","I've lost almost everyone about a month ago and I still can't pull myself together, I'm much more suicidal since then. I was at the party yesterday, my ex-friends were there, one dude was so mean, it turned out no one wanted even to talk with me. I started crying, went outside and decided to go home. One guy stopped me, he asked what had happened (he's my ex-friends' friend and he knows I suffer from depression since few years). We started talking. I said I couldn't make it anymore, I didn't want to be on this world anymore. Then he told me something that made me feel a little better. *""You know, you were depressed earlier, you wanted to die, everything was bad for a long time and yet you survived it. Then you met new people, they've changed your life and everything seemed to be better. Now, I think, you just went back to square one. You feel in the same way you've felt few months ago. And you've survived it earlier, which in my opinion makes you strong, really. Things got better once, which means they can get better again. You should be here and give it all a chance. Sure, it won't always be good, but there will be better times. And they may be truly worth living. Just please, don't give up yet. You've survived so long and I believe you can get better someday. And everything will be easier then.""*

His words remind me of a quote from a song I like: *""and it's always shining somewhere, I just gotta get there""*. I keep telling this myself everyday. **Because we just gotta get there, guys.**

Stay safe y'all and try giving life a chance. There may be nothing to lose, but surely there's so much to get."
1472,I don't want to waste your time so I'll make it short,"I hate myself
I don't deserve anything
I don't deserve life
I don't deserve death
I don't deserve friends
I don't deserve anything"
1473,What am I doing with my life?,I’m 22 about to be 23 in January. I graduated in September as a Medical Esthetician. I can’t find a job in what I went to school for. Idk what I’m passionate about everything feels exhausting and over stimulating. I work at T-Mobile as a sales rep and I like it there okay. I’ve been at T-Mobile for three years though and I’m really for a change. I don’t know what to do with my life.
1474,Why is it so hard,"Killing yourself is so easy from a logical standpoint. But why can't I just fight through the fear. Why am I so scared and afraid, why the fuck do I care about the pain and discomfort. Why does part of me still fight and fight and fight, wanting to continue and live on. I don't want this. I wish I wasn't such a fucking coward. I'm jealous of everyone who attempted and succeeded."
1475,Hopeless Death,"It’s been a lot of time that i feel totally hopeless. Now, i can’t study anymore, I can’t read anything and even no enjoyment at all. A 15 years old boy from Iran. I had a lot of talents but after that fucking migraine which affected my hole life, I can’t even sleep well. The only thing that gives me some peace is my favorite playlist. I have no one to talk about myself, even my parents don’t care about me. I was a great programmer but now, I can do nothing. Just praying to sleep forever...
Fucking life, fucking country, fucking mind."
1476,What's the least painful way to kill yourself and how do I ask the loved ones to forgive me?,"I'm just wondering, nothing planned. Not suicidal."
1477,i don’t know what to do,i’m tired of trying and i know that life just isn’t for me but i’m scared. nobody knows for certain what happens after death and i could be making a horrible choice. i’m stuck on what the right choice really is and it bothers me that i won’t know until i go through with it
1478,It hurts when you think someone you care for will feel nothing or even happy at your death,
1479,Numbness,"I feel so numb, so empty. I don't feel like Im even alive anymore. I hate that Im constantly worrying my parents and making everybody worried about me. I feel like a burden. Everyday, I just feel like the world will be better without me. 
I brought some pills and wanted to take them and overdose but I cant do it. I cant bear to hurt my family because of my choice. But I dread and know that one day I will break and end my life. 
Im done, I have done feeling a long time ago but I constantly cant sleep, cant eat and I have been pushing away many important people. I hate myself. 
I have tried talking to my parents about my issues but they brushed it off, saying it is because I have always been on the phone. 
Nobody will understand me, Im a mess, a complicated one. Im broken, I cant fix myself, so I end up hurting others around me. 

Any advice?"
1480,I cant do this anymore,"I want to stop existing, thats it, just simply. For many years ive been struggling, but ive been losing ground in the struggle every day. I spent 8 years in the military before i was injured overseas and kicked out. I have PTSD, even though i hate to admit i do. I cant sleep, the meds the VA give me just turn me into a zombie. I cant be in large open spaces or in crowds, its debilitating. After i came home from the Army, i got my degree, but the way the world is now, i cant use it, so im stuck in nowhere jobs. Ive gone through girlfriend after girlfriend, i give them the world, but every relationship ive ever had has ended with me being cheated on. My last ex cheated on me for a year with my best friend while we planned our wedding. My present relationship just took a turn for the worst. She was cheating on me with her ex husband for the last 4 years. He had no idea that she was with me, nor i knew she was with him. The really stupid thing on my part was thinking we could fix it. It was addressed and a large fight ensued between her ex husband and myself. She promised to be better and work with me through all of it, all to earn my trust back. I recently found out that its still going on. 
During this, my home was flooded by a hurricane, i lost everything. All possessions, trivial to irreplaceable, lost. I lived in a tent as a refugee for months till i was able to find a roof. 
I dont know what to do anymore. I keep getting up in the morning, only to look in the mirror, and feeling nothing but disgust at what i see.  I know what everyone is going to say, the generic ""dont do it"" and "" life gets better"". Ive heard that for years, and im still waiting. Falling apart more and more everyday, waiting for it to get better. I cant go into public anymore, i cant go into my deadend job and face anyone anymore. I cry every night, and im always plagued by nightmares. I cant function anymore. Love isnt in the cards for me, nor is a normal life. Ive accepted this, but the self loathing and fear are very real. I know im being pathetic, and any time i try to vent, people just get angry with me.
Im writing this cause im at my last rung in my ladder. Ive been doing this for years, and i dont know what to do anymore. This is just barely surviving, not living."
1481,i planned this for months and only now am i having doubts a week before my dead line,"(i'm from England) 

i'm scared but i'm not in a sense i know i've made my mind up and nothings gonna change it so i'm going to end my suffering which i've had to endure since i was 6 (i'm 16 coming to 17) it has been so long i've forgotten what my genuine laugh is anymore the only time i did kinda laugh were chuckles when i was with my very very close friend (she was female we both had strong feelings for each other) but things happened she always knew something wasn't right with me and she knew i was pretty much faking being happy and i could never bring my self to say anything because i'm autistic and like to keep things to my self. so over time it ruined things she was amazing at everything now things aren't the same were barely friends anymore so my only little source of happiness has been gone for a while and time hasn't healed anything its only made my mental state even worse  i just miss her ...

i just dunno what to do because i've planned this for a long long while i've brought everything the black rope the black envelopes printed and written all my letters the location what time what i'm going to wear i'm going to dress up in the nicest clothes i have and shave have a bath on the day and some more but you get the gist i've thought long and hard just a week before i dangle my self from a high tree i know i can climb up to i've only just started having doubts 

ive come to terms and accepted whats gonna happen or whatever but i've always been a coward so i'm scared i might pussy out at the last second which i really don't wanna do because i cant keep living like this i'm so so tired and emotionally tired 

she was so unique and pretty and amazing at love making

and i fucked everything up there's more to the story on what happened between us but its to hard to type and re-live

i'm lost hopefully i don't pussy out well its all in her note i've told her its NOT her fault only mine hope she sees that, this is my last ever rant it seems so yeah..."
1482,There is no point in living when there are millions of people who are better than you,
1483,Has it occurred to any of you that some people might be better off killing themselves and dont need to be talked out of it? Like a sec offender living in a tent village under an overpass in Miami that no one wants anything to do with and will never find gainful employment.,
1484,Another weekend alone. I don't have one friend.,"Honestly I might as well not exist cause that's the way everyone treats me. I hate social media, no one is your friend they just want to know your business or creep on photos. I'm never ever thought about. I just want to take pills and be done I really do."
1485,Incompetent or Afraid?,"23/F. My mom just told me that I'm ""always looking for an excuse to stay exactly the same"". I was telling her how I feel trapped in their house and treated like an incompetent child. They want me to be honest, but I can't tell them that I'm paralyzed with fear around them. My mother has apologized for being abusive to me as a little girl, but I can't fully heal from that. My parents are loving and haven't hit me in years, but I'm fearful of them. But I can't be honest. They tell me I can be honest with them, but I know deep down I can't. They'd be angry at me.

I'm so fucked up inside, I can't even organize all my thoughts here in one post. Death seems more appealing by the month.

Before you say I should move out: I am financially trapped. I've fucked up school so I have no degree, and I work part-time until I graduate for minimum wage. I'm single because no one wants me who I want back, so I'm stuck here until the day I die, it seems.

And if this keeps up...I don't trust myself not to die."
1486,"Maybe its a Sign, Back at Crossroads- Last Shot","I know words are powerful, but's got nothing on what I've felt the past year in a half. Everyone thinks so much of me, and I can't keep reaching their expectations. I'm happy, I really am. But i keep crafting these ideas in my head at night, and when interacting with my loved ones that I'm not doing enough. Then, I go and do it all, but even its just not enough. It will never be enough. I will never be enough. I'm finally with the woman of, and never have I known someone to believe in me with the depth she does. She really inspires me to try harder. But I'm still nowhere, and I'm starting to hold her back. She keeps the honey in my heart, and keeps me from being biter. I'm just so fucking tired. And I finally feel like I'm giving the very last of me. The people in my immediate life mean so much to me, this is the only way I'll ever feel I've made my own choice. 

I was molested a lot when I was 5 and 6. I'm a black guy in the south who held onto his virginity until he was 23 because I needed to feel like I made a choice of my own conscious efforts. I've had this hole in my belly since I was 5. Ive gone to the belly to find a beast, but it was empty. I crammed it with knowledge, friends, love, exercise, traveling, you name it. I kept giving life hell every damn day. But today. Last night. I don't think I can anymore. What do you do when everything seems foreign; and those things you feel familiar, you bring harm, or don't serve them as well as they deserve.

 I chose not to burn myself alive when. I had my dads kingsoil and spread it around the back shed, then sat inside for some hours in the middle of the night. What made me stop was the thought in the back of my head that went, ""somebody loves you. chill."" Now, that idea is in the forefront of my mind, and in the back, everyday is a voice scheming against me. No, I'm not schizophrenic. Its just a hurt me incessantly whispering in the back of my mind telling me mean things. Its like a robot. I learned to ignore it most days. Today, the only thing holding me back is the idea of putting my woman through suffering, but even now, I'm still by a thread. I'm trying so hard to hold on. I really hope she believes me.

But now, I'm not so sure the back of my mind is incorrect in his assessment. Even the idea that I'm waiting for my check to come in, so i may disappear, begin the embarkment to my final destination, document the whole thing, I'm sure to have fun, mail the notes and phone to my woman and family, before this body gives weigh watching sunset is a fucked up idea. I hate that it'd put my partner, through pain. I'm sorry that it'd make my family ache. But its the only thing I thought I had left. Then, as I was designing my way out... or my way back (reincarnation joke), my uncle text me, ""You Are Free."" 

I believe in signs. This is the first time I've gone into the day with my notes, and took such initiative. Honestly, it made me feel safer. But my uncle texting me, ""you are free"" got me wondering. I looked up the hotlines, but don't feel comfortable calling for the same reason I never speak about these feelings with anyone. I don't want to be on pills, I don't want to be told what to do, I don't want to be forced to be someone I'm not. I know if I ever spoke openly about how I feel, they wouldn't treat me like a competent person. Feeling broken, and perpetually being treated as something to fix WILL PUSH ME TO KILL MYSELF IN THE MOST CONVENIENT WAY FOR ME DESPITE THE MEASURE. And I don't want to do that to them just because I'm selfish enough to bother them with something they wouldn't know how to deal with. Everyone in my loves me, but they don't quite care about how I need them to, and they don't often listen when i express how.

And so, Unc's text led me to writing this. I need help, and I just don't know how to ask for it. Living just doesn't feel much of my own volition anymore. And I'm just fucking up.

You know what's sad? I've caught 3 good friends from committing. And I'm starting to reject my own bullshit and rationale why this is a solid ass option. 

I don't even know if this'll reach anyone. I'm just throwing the sea my message in a bottle. Last shot. 

Whoever gets this,

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."
1487,How to get support?,"I told my parents that I recently made an attempt at taking my life and that I am finding it really hard to just exist, they chided me and made me feel extremely guilty, then I went to the only friend I had, told her the same and asked her if she could just be there for me for a few weeks at least and to guide me through this if possible, she just told me that I was needy and clingy and too emotional for a guy, and that if I am so far down the line maybe I should just do it and she ghosted me, where do I go from here, I literally don't have anybody else left in my life that could help me, and I am starting to feel like these support structure that everybody keeps talking about only exists in fiction"
1488,"I give up, I've had enough.","I have a lot of mental health issues/illnesses which make it impossible to get a job. I've tried. So I did what I thought was best and got tons of professional help. All kinds and for over 15 years now... I still lived with my parents but they finally divorced after living too long under my father's abuse. We went to live with my mother's potential new boyfriend but after almost a year, certain things happened and now we'll be homeless tomorrow. We could stay with a family member but only for a few days. I still struggle every day not to kill myself but now... I don't know how I could recover from my situation. I'm not even sure if I want to anymore. I've had so many bad things happen and I give up. I've had enough. I knew I was gonna kill myself one day when I was barely 8 years old. I guess that day finally arrived.
I just don't know how to do it with a 100 % guarantee that I don't fail. Obviously I know I can't really ask for it here but message me or whatever. Maybe, most likely not, someone can spark some new hope in me. Any help is appreciated I guess. I'm just numb. I'm not even crying although I know I should be."
1489,I NEED FRIENDS SO BAD !!!!!,I have lots of mental problems and I have nobody to support me. Plz be my friend. Aaagh this feels like crap sorry
1490,Death by Chocolate (literally),"Hi guys,

I’ve somehow survived 35 days since my last post, but I really cannot take it anymore. I’m doing everything “right”- going to therapy, taking my meds, not isolating myself, etc., but I still feel so self-destructive and like I want to disappear. I have a lot of people that love me and want to support me, but even with them, I feel lonely and like no one gets it. 

So I’m planning on using my “easy” way out- I’m severely allergic to nuts, so I’m gonna buy a bunch of Reese’s cups and call it a day. I’m excited to have my childhood’s literal forbidden fruit because I remember liking the taste of peanut butter but never being able to have it. At least of all the ways to die, this one is not labor intensive. 

Thanks if you read this."
1491,I'm scared...,"I don't want to go... But I have no choice but to kill myself. I'm a bad person... I have to die..

I'm so sorry for everything I did or might have done."
1493,I make posts whining about my life on this subreddit all the time thinking it’ll make me feel better but it never does,I’m so emotionally and socially unavailable that any effort anyone makes trying to reach out and help me does nothing for me. It sucks because people are genuinely trying to help but for whatever reason it has no effect on me. Why can’t I just die in my sleep
1494,I m 25 I want to be with my parents and in my native,I want to suicide. I m alone in out of my native. I don't have a job.i want to go home back.i want to be with my parents. I m week so lazy.i don't wanna hear anyone advice..i don't like this world I wish this world should get destroy..pls God destroy this world..i want to die...i m mad..so mad..i m useless..i m not doing for the last 4yrs...
1495,Still living only because I have unfulfilled wishes &amp; family and friends I care about.,"I'm only living for my parents and friends whom I care about as well as things I give a damn about such as traveling and subtle passions like casual gaming and hobby photography. Many of my wishes are still unfulfilled (I still want to travel to the US and Japan before I die). But other than these I don't really see the point of living and struggling till old age slogging for money and dealing with people's bullshit in a society that could give less of a damn about you and one that is becoming worse and worse both physically and morally especially with the rise of unfettered capitalism.

Once my parents are gone and I have fulfilled most if not all of my wishes I will probably opt to check out at a rough estimate of age 40 max. Meanwhile I'm going to try my best to enjoy every moment and fulfil my wishes before this age that I have set for myself to check out."
1496,Bye,"I just don't feel anything anymore
Maybe I'll feel something while dying"
1497,Bubble burst,"Today I was in a ""happiness"" bubble. I was unable to feel sad, even though I should have.
Now everything has been bad:
I overslept
I woke up feeling very bad (fisically)
I spilled hot milk over my legs, and now the wet spot on my pants feels cold too
I've been unable to close the biscuit package properly

I thought I wanted to die, and then I suddenly realized I had wanted that al the way through the bubble. The suicidal thoughts had never left. I'm feeling overwhelmed right now, but I need to study for a classtest, do you know any method to focus during a situation like this?"
1498,Is there anyone who also can't make things right?,"I know, everyone here wishes the best for everyone and all that..

But, anyways, I tried up to this day, I seriously could not make things right. I don't believe anymore that there is help for any of us or anything meaningful to people who had already lost it all. 

Assume that I could achieve anything I ever wished for, what good it would do if I have noone to share it with. 

I am just through all this love yourself talk. I am so sorry but I do not understand why and how one would love himself. There is no such an option if one is constantly denied love. 

I swear I had tried anything and everything in my power to make things right and I wish I just drop dead."
1499,Don’t wanna be here anymore,"Depressed and medicated for 5 years. Having an affair with a married man who I love so deeply, though I know he will never leave her. So basically I’m stuck. Can’t be with him, can’t be without him. And every day is agony. I simply don’t want to carry on, there is no life for me beyond this"
1500,I dont want to keep going on,"I just don't want to suffer like this anymore. I don't want to deal with seeing how everyone has someone to talk to, how everyone has friends and how everyone is in a relationship. Like, even the ones who claim to be the loneliest actually have friends. I happen to be beyond lonely. I feel like I'm not human. That's why I'm always excluded and put aside. Cause I'm not like them. Even online. I got rejected again last week, as usual. That person made me have false hopes. My heart is still shattered since then. I just wish I was noticed, loved and cared for. That's what I wished for my whole life, but it just doesn't happen. At this point I think I'm not made to have someone, even someone to talk to. I'm made only for loneliness and suffering. Im 100% sure I'll be that type of forever alone woman with 10 cats that people make fun of. Im tired of creating persons in my head and imagining them love me. That's what I did my whole life. That's how I stayed sane until now. But not even that helps anymore. I'm a complete failure that doesn't have chance at anything. I don't even care about myself anymore. I started to eat unhealthy food with all kinds of chemicals again. I just don't care anymore. Every day I wish I had terminal cancer or that I get hit by a car. Every day I wish I die. There's really no reason for me to exist. I had enough loneliness and abuse in these 18 shitty years of my life, I had enough bullying, enough of me being a tool of fun for people. I'm drained and empty. I can't even think properly anymore, everything is foggy. I hate myself for my cowardice and weakness. I hate myself for still wanting the things that are impossible to achieve. I keep telling myself to stop craving friendship or relationship because I'm a failure and have no chance at that. If I had, wouldn't I have friends or a relationship by now? Yeah,now  I'm going back to suffer and cry because I'm miserable and I have 0 friends and I'm single. I just wanted to vent. Sorry for this post, it's too chaotic."
1501,Got through two attempts. Don't have anyone else to share the news with so here I am !,"It's been a really rough couple of months, hah. I go through waves of severity in my depression but for some reason the one I just went through was the strongest yet. 

I've dealt with mental illness for the majority of my life, starting with depression and bulimia, turning into self mutilation in recent months. While I don't regret it and still think it was best for my mental health, breaking up with my ex boyfriend a couple months definitely left me the most isolated I've been in a while,  and my mind hasn't always been the best only company. 

 It's kind of weird not wanting to die. I attempted in two different ways, one of which was known to be relatively painless. I remember looking forward to it so much. Like I could finally escape all of this. But recently that desire has been feeling far more distant. Not that I suddenly have this strong will to live, but more so that I just dont feel like dying. I gave myself nerve damage with some of my self harm. It hurts most days but it's also a reminder that what I've gone through was real, as unhealthy as that kind of physical reminder is. 

Recently I'll look at how badly mutilated and scarred my body is and wonder how I'll ever move past this, emotionally or physically. I still wonder that. I think that's why I still keep the bottle in my room. I don't know why I haven't gotten rid of it but, although I feel like I'm past my worst moments it's still a comfort to have. Like an emergency escape button, hah. But I know I'm not going to use it. At least not for a while. 

I'm glad to be past through the worst of it all. I don't know why I posted this but it feels nice to get out. Thank you to anyone who happened to read this far 💛 I hope you all are bearing as best you can, and that we all find something to smile about today :)"
1502,Recently found out a classmate of mine killed herself,"I’ve been depressed for a long time, since I was about 13 and I’m 29 now.. 
my life sucks, I mean I have everything: a girlfriend, a loving family .. financially I’m not so well off but my family supports me, I have a house and two loving pets but I ducking hate my life.

Recently found out that a classmate of mine killed herself a few years ago, super popular girl .. she was a model, popular, beautiful and lived a wealthy life. 
Something in her head clicked and she killed herself, I didn’t find out until a few years later cause web weren’t really that close but she never seemed like the type who’d do it.

My point it, if she could do it, why am I putting it off? I think my time is coming soon..
My girlfriend doesn’t seem to appreciate my anymore and my life is a mess

Suicidal procrastination?"
1503,I don’t know what to do anymore,Every fucking day I break down. I’ve already grieved my own death but I’m still struggling accepting the pain that I’ll be putting the rest of my family in when I kill myself. I know it’s selfish and awful but the longer I wait the more people I meet and the more people I’ll hurt. I feel like a fraud pretending to care about anything in the future. Who fucking cares. I won’t be here. I just don’t know how to accept the pain of others and be able to finally do it. I just want out. I want out NOW
1504,Survivors of an attempt to suicide: how's life since ?,
1505,Selling all my stuff to give my kids one last good Christmas.,"I'm disabled with a combination of mental health issues. Recently I discovered that the administration is going to be looking at kicking people like myself off our benefits. I'm too sick to afford insurance, and my chronic physical pain prevents me from working, I can't even use a mouse. 

My Trump loving parents bought me a tv for Christmas (because who needs medicine when you have a tv, right?) And I'll be selling it and whatever else I can in order to give my kids a decent holiday. Their birthdays are also coming up, so I am going to wait until my own birthday much later in the year to do it. 

I'm just going to get some of that easy to get fentanyl and take it all at once. I'm out of options, I don't even have a working car to live in. 

I'm hoping to make it look like an accident somehow but I'm not sure how."
1506,"I wrote a note, I have been cutting, I dont know what to do anymore.","I have been in and out of the hospital the past couple months due to suicidal tendencies. Last month I began ECT treatments but I am not feeling any less depressed or suicidal. I have started cutting myself on my wrist because it makes me feel a little better and over the last couple days I wrote my suicide note.

I just dont know what to do anymore. I feel like I am making my wife life harder because I am a financial burden and emotionally I must be difficult to deal with recently.

Im afraid to talk to my therapist about this and wind up back in the hospital. Also Im not sure I want to be saved anymore... If I just died that would be ok for me...Part of me wonders if maybe Im done. I did what I could and now its time to go.

I wish I was better with words, but I dont really know what else to say. Im just sitting in my room crying wanting to drive this knife through my skull."
1507,everything feels like bullshit,"everything, gay acceptance, all this love everyone and everything else people expound, everything feels like bullshit its all fucking marketing. this sub feels like bullshit no one fucking gives a flying fuck and most do underhanded shit to get you to a breaking point, it feels like everyone wants you to kill yourself, everything is fucking bullshit"
1508,I feel like a little cuck for posting this but I don’t care anymore,"I’m at the end of my rope or however you say it, note I don’t care for grammar at all so if you see typos that’s why. First time I tried to kill myself was at 14 because It seemed like my parents hated me because I was fuckin retarded and had to go to summer school like twice and they said that I never change, I believe I was gonna meet up with a guy online from a website that was made for suicidal people but my parents called the police which forced me to go to the hospital or psychiatric ward idk which one because I wasn’t there for too long only reason I didn’t continue was because I thought my parents cared for my well-being but soon after my parents started going at it again started calling me stupid, bringing up the fact I tried to kill myself every time we got into an argument which was fuckin often, like 5 months ago my parents kicked me out so I was homeless for a little while until this nice couple took me in and offered to let me stay until I turn 18 which I’m more than happy with. I also got a job because of them which I gladly took because I get to have extra cash for a car for when I turn 18 (I don’t have a drivers license) as I continued to work the boyfriend kept driving me to work and sometimes he wouldn’t be able to drive me because he was busy which is 100% understandable but those days I had to miss work because I didn’t have a debit card to Uber to work (I sometimes paid the the guy 20 bucks for an Uber I didn’t do it often because 20 dollars is a lot of money for me) this happened like maybe 3 times maybe 4 I don’t remember exactly but the last time my manager pulled me into her office and told me that I wasn’t dependable and whenever I made a mistake i would say my bad or sorry reason but never change which triggered my memories of my parents saying the same exact thing and now I’m contemplating whether I’ll ever change or is what my parents said is true that I’m trash that’ll never change so at the moment I’ve decided when I turn 18 I’m going back to my hometown to party with my friends for 7 days straight get wasted every single day and at the 7th night idk how I’m gonna do it but I’m gonna off myself. I can’t handle the fact that what my parents said might be true. I can’t talk about this to anyone I know because I’m in a completely new state and I don’t know anyone outside of my job and the couple that took me in, I don’t want people to think there’s something wrong with me or try to force me into a ward again so I decided to post this here on a throwaway"
1509,What happens when it's not better in the morning?,"Lurker for a long time on my main, just made this bc shit isn't getting any better &amp; I want to stay anon.

But seriously, it used to feel a little better when I woke up after a bad night. I'd have a horribly long cry, wishing I were dead. But in the morning I'd always feel a little lighter.

Not today. Today I wished I had walked down the street to lay on the train tracks, but it's too late in the morning, too open, people would see.

The thoughts are just getting darker, more urgent. My dad was bipolar or I suspect had BPD instead, and I am almost positive I have BPD, but have always managed to avoid a diagnosis. On purpose. I used to want to have a gun for safety, but always held off bc I knew deep down that if I got one, it'd be the way I ended up killing myself. Irony.

I should be happy, I have a solid (yet demanding) career, an insanely loving boyfriend who will be devastated one day when I kill myself, either 3 days, 3 years or 30 years from now. I know I won't die of natural causes. I've known that since I was young.

I don't have friends, though. I lost them when I left my ex and the area we lived in. My best friend moved across the country, and my other best friend is starting a business and I'm moving about a 2 hours drive from her, if any of that actually works out.

I feel guilty even posting here bc I should just be fucking HAPPY. I see other people here who have real struggles, and I guess I've had some as well. But on the surface there's nothing that should be making me like this. It's just my stupid, fucked up, broken brain. It's always been broken.

If you read this for even a word, thank you. I don't even feel like I deserve a voice or anyone's time. I just hope the loneliness and self hatred ends soon, and if not, I hope it's relatable to some of you so you feel less alone."
1510,Found the right place where I can kill myself,"I have nowhere to hang off of, so I have a belt around the leg of my table. When the time is right I’ll off myself. I had a break down the other day and called an estranged close friend, as soon as I heard her voice say “hello” I hung and was kicking myself for being so stupid. I don’t know who to turn to, I’ve never not been sad all the time so I’ve become something of a burden. I just bottle shit up now, my mom thinks I’m better now, she just hears what she wants to. I feel so empty, this isn’t as emotional as my usual posts, I just feel so numb. I’m just gonna leave a note telling a few people I’m sorry, including my mom. She was in tears when I was locked in a ward for attempting suicide. Anyways, that’s all, I found my suicide spot. I find it genuinely relaxing that it’s always an option"
1511,Looking for somebody to talk to,"I’m going to be ending it soon. I’m not looking for anybody who’s going to try to talk me out of it, I would like someone in a similar position to me. I want to spend my last few days with somebody who understands. Please message me if interested"
1512,I give up she won I lost and I’m already dead inside,She stopped talking to me because she didn’t have feelings for me I mean she has a bf who she’s gonna marry but she won she has a great life with a career in mind and a guy she’s gonna marry and lots of friends and I’m an alcoholic loser disappointment. I brought this upon myself but I never thought it would get this bad and seeing as it’s only gonna get worse I’m hoping I’ll be able to kill myself
1513,Ending it is starting to look pretty good.,"I'm not super religious but I still believe in God, and owe him and anyone who actually does give a crap/care a big apology not because I'm losing my faith but because this is looking like the only way out... I brought this on myself anyway.. I've messed up bigger than anyone a few times in my life, even towards the end I refuse to slander people's names, as bad a person as I may be.. but I can confess the things I've done... this one's not so major but a good starting point or maybe it is major I don't know.. but I don't listen for shit, I keep trying to care for others when they tell me not to, like to hand out comfort in a time of need, or checking on them on, and off... They have yelled at me to leave them alone but I figured it was out of their hurt of loss, and I stood strong reminding them I'm there if they need anything probably a stupid move... IDK anymore truly.. as for some of my bigger mistakes, I had a miscarriage when I was 23, didn't tell the father till a week after I had found out, dumb move incredibly dumb move to cope first, and wait... I didn't even know I was pregnant until the loss so he feels I was hiding the whole thing from him... After all the loss and Blame I went drinking soon after, what the fuck is wrong with me, but anyways drink so much I nearly got alcohol poisoning I just wanted to forget the loss and the pain... And that was one of the only times mom called me right as I was in the middle of my second large bottle.. she starts taunting me about it probably wasn't even his and other stuff, but I've been loyal to him my whole life... So what did my semi drunk brain (I don't get drunk the way other people do) think was a good idea? Oh you think we're not close like that? Que my dumbass showing a nude of him... Somehow even drinking that much I had enough common sense to you use the scribble tool on my phone at the time, so it wasn't the worst but still I regret it to this day now at this point over 10 years later. Ive apologized and done everything to try to make up for it... Even trying to explain my side.. heck for a while there I thought it was a fever dream, because I would never consciously do such a thing, I don't want to hurt anyone especially someone so close to me, I've known so long... Was that enough fuck ups in my life to satisfy me apparently not... More recently I appeared at his grandparents funeral (public viewing) I did not dare come to the burial. But I wanted to try and be there for them, and things were looking up lately before they had passed.. so I didn't think it too strange since I've grown up alongside the family. Big mistake, bad mistake, terrible mistake.. when I'm concerned for people I'm known for following them as they say like a puppy dog, if they're missing for too long I kind of go on the search I don't even tell myself to it's almost borderline instinctual if that makes sense... I'll probably even end it always regretting these things. I kind of have to wonder if I will be stuck as one of those wandering spirits, or whether I will burn in hell for what I've done... Except for the caring too much one. I have never, and will never repeat any of my other mistakes listed here... But no matter how much I repent, and prove myself, it will never be okay. I'll never be forgiven. I'll never have the future I dreamed. I'll never have a family. And possibly worst of all the one so precious to me, that I grew up alongside we'll never truly know how sorry I am. I wish things could be the same. I wish you could see that I'm still me deep inside.. I'm not out to hurt you, and I'm sorry I've made mistakes... part of me doesn't want to die, but the rest of me does not out of self-pity, but because I don't want to hurt anyone else... All I ever wanted to do was help, but I see now I just make things worse... I'm sorry."
1514,Not sure if I wanna die or just prove a point,"I’ve planned my suicide. I can’t believe I’ve actually planned it. Not sure if I’ll have the guts to go through with it. I have to wait for my medication to be refilled. 
 
My current only reasons to not do it is to not traumatize my little brother if he finds me and to not make my best friend and girlfriend sad. 
 
I don’t think I even want to die. Just to prove to my parents that yes mom, I am trans, I’m not a girl. 
 
I’m just a waste of money and time. 
 
Help."
1515,I've been going out with a girl. I really like her. I'm not sure when/how or even IF to tell her about my mental state.,"Any advice? Obviously my first time trying out this dating thing. Is it just a vibe thing? I'm bad at that. I fuck up social situations too easily.   


If it helps, she's already revealed a little about her mental illnesses (bipolar 2), but suicidal feelings are not something she ever brought up.  


I'm sorry if this is a stupid questions or something"
1516,When is it time to go the hospital?,Where is the line between ‘getting by’ and acting on suicidal impulse? When do I decide it’s too much and that  it’s ok to admit that it’s too much? I’ve gone from occasional thoughts of suicide to near constant fantasizing about ways to hurt myself. I don’t have a method available to me so that’s why I use the word fantasize. Is it time now? Is it bad enough yet to be worth REALLY ruining Christmas? FUCKING CHRISTMAS makes everything harder
1517,I'm a mess [RANT],"I don't understand my parents. 

I tell them my problems. I tell them the anxiety that comes from school. 

They say ""they understand"", yet they care more about my math grade than my mental health. Oh,  you wanted to see a therapist? Nope, because we're gonna spend money on a math tutor, because that's whats important.

You gotta get that A. You gotta get that honor roll. Because that's how life works. 

Oh you wanna kill youself? Oh, you're self harming? 

It's that damn phone of yours. 

I love my parents but sometimes... god. I tell my friend most of my problems more than my parents. Things aren't getting any better. Things never get fucking better. 

High school is pure hell, almost out of it, but I'm barely surviving. I don't give a shit anymore."
1518,I thinks it's unfair...,"To hate my suicide.

Wanting me to stick around.

Telling me it's not the answer.

You know every second of life for me is torture.

Why do you want to see me go through it everyday?

Why do you hate me so much?

What did I do to you?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No

You don't hate me.

You find this funny.

It entertains you to see me in so much pain

To see everyone else look at me as if i'm the Devil's reincarnation.

You want to see me frustrated, annoyed, and angry because you think it's funny.

That's the real reason you don't want me to go.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You know that life won't get better for me while i'm still alive...."
1519,I'm trapped in the holidays and don't know what to do anymore.,"This is probably going to be long. Thank you in advance if you read through it all.

About two years ago- I was 20 at the time- I was spending the holidays at my parents house, but my boyfriend had invited me over to a candlelit dinner. He lived an hour away. I decided I would go. My mother was extremely angry with me. She worried I wouldn't make it to the outing for the movies with our whole family the next morning. (Which wasn't Christmas morning btw. It was over a week before.) But I scheduled everything out. I knew I would be fine.
But then I got a migraine at my boyfriend's place. I spent the whole night throwing up. I had prescribed migraine meds at my dorm about 10 minutes away from my boyfriends house, so I swallowed the nausea and drove over there. (My boyfriend didn't have a license so he couldn't help me here.) I got there. Trudged up three flights of stairs. And realized I'd left the door key at my boyfriend's house. By the time I got back to his place I was too sick to try again.
So of course I couldn't make it to the family movie. Because I couldn't go my cousin didn't want to go and that made everyone else not want to go so the whole thing fell apart.
My mom was livid with me. She yelled that I ruined Christmas.
Years later and I still haven't seen the movie. It was Pixar's Coco. Being an animation student I was initially really excited about it but I can't watch it now. Looking at anything related to the movie makes me sad.

It's all still haunting me.
I had to relive the whole thing with my therapist a few days ago. I've felt kind of numb since then.
I can't spend Christmas with my boyfriend and his kind family because I have to go to my grandma's. Granddad died over the summer so I'd be a real asshole if I wasn't there for her over the holidays. But the idea of being there with my mom makes me panic. I can't just go home if she's being difficult because we will have flown there. I can't just catch a plane back home. I don't have the money for it.
I feel so trapped. I know my mom is going to make Christmas hard. She did last year and you already read about the year before.
It's really hard because I work at a restaurant that has a Christmas tree right next to my post. Christmas music blasts over the loudspeaker and I work doubles so it's there. All day. It doesn't stop. I didn't work doubles before. But now several are scheduled for me. I don't know why.
Yesterday was my first series of doubles and I got so depressed that I got physically nauseous.

I don't know if I can do it. I don't have a plan. Maybe I'd try to jump off a huge overpass or something. But I'm at the point where I'm hoping one of the cars next to me on the road will be a drunk driver that'll end it all for me."
1520,I'm a hollow shell of the man I never was anyway,"I ashamed to admit my feelings on killing myself because others have great (for lack of a better term) reasons compared to me. I've read stories and stories for 5 hours now and I'm just pathetic thinking all thse bad feelings. Yesterday was one of the worst days of my life and all the support I had during turned on me after it was figured out and I had to apologize and down xanax till I felt Nothing. To be honest if today wasnt a big secret Santa day for all my friends who are coming here I'd have proably hurt myself. If I diddnt have a trip with my girlfriend next week id have killed myself because shes only staying with me because of this trip anyway. All I want is too die in a way that makes it look like an accident so my family womt be ashamed of me as much as they must be inside. And this sucks because in a fucking kindergarten teacher my students wont understand they cant know what happened to me and why. I'm so scared all the time of my own brain. 

I'll end up deleting I already know it. I'm sorry everyone domt waste your time help somone who can be helped and needs it, not me."
1521,really tired/vent,"I don't really want to talk to the people around me about how i've been feeming so so sad for the last month, it's getting really hard to deal with, you know?
I'm not scared of their reaction it's just that i'm so tired of repeating myself when i'm down, it gets old, and i just don't want to bother anymore, i'm tired of all this shit in my head.

I don't really want to die but it's all i can think about when it gets this bad. 
Things have been toning down a bit in my life right now, but i still feel like shit, and i don't know, i feel like i'm decaying inside. I can't think well, my thoughts get all mixed up, all the time, and i get so aggressive towards my loved ones when something bothers me, i feel like a really horrible person.

And all the violent thoughts that come through my mind are just a living hell, everything is so graphic when i close my eyes, i can't sleep well, i'm always tired. I feel like shutting down and just calling it quits. I'm so tired of being in agony, nobody could ever understand how much i'm hurting and i don't know what to do anymore at this point. 

Kind of want to give up and let myself flow through life without providing any effort. 

I'm so tired... so very tired.."
1522,killing myself on jan 1st 2020,"my parents found out i have depression, now my mom is treating me differently while my dad takes on a more gentler and understanding approach. My mom is guilt tripping me and telling me to kill myself, she wouldn't care she said. So I was deeply hurt, I recently purchased a rope 2 hours ago online. I'm planning to write goodbye letters next to my ex-boyfriend who I always loved, my friend who I drifted apart with but our memories together haunts me, my best friends who stuck around me and helped me get better, which vainly failed. And of course, my dad, I love my dad very much. I already wrote a will 2 months ago. I told my classmates about my plan, and they all tried their best to make me feel better. I love them so much, but if I have to endure the pain everyday at home being discriminated and bullied by my mom... I just can't...

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, fuck 2019."
1523,i think im finally ready,"i dont know if itll happen today, or tomorrow, or the next day or whenever, but i know that im going to do everything to just break my mental down and finally do it, im sick of living like this, everyone in my family hates me and they show it every day, i get verbally abused all the time, i dont feel like i have anyone, on top of that im going to prison for possibly ten years, i literally see no reason to keep going, the only thing that im pissed off about is that i threw out all my drugs i could overdose on when i forced myself to pretend its all fine, now im just going to have to get wasted and keep cutting until im gone"
1524,I don’t know what to do,"I’m struggling so much I’m in crisis. I don’t feel I can rely on anyone any more to listen to me and to reach out to. Every time I reach out it’s always about them. I feel so awful talking about my mental health but I am really struggling, I burnt the whole of my arm the other day and it’s hurting so much and I’ve managed to convince people it was an accident. No ones taking me seriously, no one knows how hard I’m struggling to keep going. I just want to kill myself. I just know that people will blame themselves for not doing enough. Am I wrong to expect people to listen? Am I meant to do this myself? The doctors don’t care they just think I need to do breathing exercises and my counsellor has let me go. I just feel like I’m a burden to everyone and I don’t have the strength to keep on going.

I need help but I don’t know what sort of help, I just believe my time is ending soon."
1525,I have an inferiority complex,"I have a severe inferiority complex. I've had it for almost 3 years now, and it's cost me pretty much everything. It started with me losing my best friend because I was a belligerent asshole, then changing my behavior completely and trying to become someone I'm not (specifically, someone with empathy and humility), and then meeting new people that made me revert to my old personality. I've never been a good person, and I'm not just saying that, if you saw the things I did behind closed doors you'd beat the shit out of me. I've blackmailed people to get them to keep talking to me, stole people's social media passwords to see what they were saying about me and conspired with other groups of people to get back at those who ""betrayed"" me, even if their betrayal was completely justified. I am the most pathetic, genuinely disgusting person I've ever met, and because of recent events I was just reminded of that. My friend group has cut me off, and like last time it stings really bad. They stopped talking to me because I was jealous of my best friend spending time with someone that disliked me, someone whose presence I hated so much I tried to stir up shit to make them hate each other. Once my grand scheme was found out they stopped talking to me. That was it. I'm blocked on social media, I can't send texts, and if I approached them in real life they'd probably call the cops. So here we go, once again, I'm all alone and have to meet new people so the cycle can repeat. 

I think the term ""antisocial extrovert"" fits me perfectly. Not because I avoid socialization, but because I end up completely ignoring the norms, which results in a majority of people not being able to stand me. I always end up making friends that share my traits, and our friendship is toxic as a result. It always ends the same way, too; they do something that pisses me off, I do something in response, they cut me off and I go full stalker mode and try to fuck them over in whatever way possible. It's going to happen now, it's going to happen in the future, it probably won't stop until someone kills me or I kill myself. I am dependent on other people but I can't respect their feelings, and if I try to change that I'll just get bored and go back. 

Fuck my life."
1526,Suicidal but not anorexic?,"Anyone here suicidal and underweight but trying to lose more to make it easier to die? I’m not anorexic per se, of course I wouldn’t mind losing a few more pounds just for the hell of it but what drives me more is that it will be easier to die..."
1527,i really wanna end it but im to much of a coward,i dont want to be a bother to people anymore i just wana end it but im too afraid to die i wish something could just happen to me nothing is making me happy i dont have the motivation and im just a bother to people my family and friends god what am i doing im failing school because i dont have the motivation to go and im making excuses for my self fuck im sorry if im not making any sense i dont know what to do anymore.
1528,"I wasted my 18 years on the earth, broke trust of my parents, wasted their money, I'm just a coward, I wish I could sleep and never wake up. I just don't know what to do!",
1529,I feel empty and hopeless and I just want to get away,I don't want to die but I don't want to be here. I wish I could just float away in peace and stop all my suffering. Everything hurts. I can't cope anymore.
1530,Who wants to talk,"I look forward to nights where I can drink and take my pills, so I can stop crying for a few hours."
1531,"I was actually happy, i just got a girlfriend and a new job. Then i was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma, a rare variant of skeletal cancer that has spread to my bone marrow.",Now i cant think of anything else than taking my life since i am going to burden my family with cancer bills. What am i supposed to do?
1532,Fml,"I can't just keep waking up crying and spending every holiday alone. This isn't life. I want to die but I'm scared and I want a better life, not just an end to this shitty one"
1533,I'm unlovable and I can't stand it.,"Sorry if not the right sub.

I've had many girlfriends in the past, some for a ""long""  time, some for only weeks. But I think at this point, being 38, I'm beyond the age where women will want to settle down. In the past decade I had one girl who I was totally in love with and we were happy together... Until I told her that I was in love with her. She instantly said we need to be apart and she didn't want to see me for a while.

Next I was with this other girl for almost 2 years, we moved halfway across the US together and initially I thought she'd be a good partner (she owned her own business where we moved from). But unfortunately all she wanted to do was to play league of legends all day, not look for a job or try to pass the test in our new state for her business. I eventually couldn't even, and I had to get away from what I felt was a leech on my life.

Shortly after that I met someone (29f now) who I almost instantly thought would be my life going forward. She was gorgeous and we had similar interests and we never fought. 3 years later she broke up with me and I discovered just days later that she'd been cheating on me with a man (50's m) for the previous 9 months. I was completely blindsided by this--she never admitted anything, so it's still raw because I don't have any closure-- but I'm trying to work on it. 

My question... Is there something wrong with me (including making bad choices) or am I having some bad luck? 

Again I'm 38 and never been married and no children."
1534,huh.,"    hmmmm, big hmmm. people don't seem to care about me unless they think I'm through some inner turmoil, which I always am, but they only catch me in my edgy weirdo days. Things have been going rough lately and not how I wanted them to, and I'm kinda angry, brethren. I've stuck to all the promises I've made, basically living for other people at this point, and supposed loved ones have been stomping with slimy, muddy boots on me and I'm tired. really tired. my mind's a mess, I don't know who I am, whether it be gender or simple sexual orientation and life just makes me sick. lmao, what a weathered world. I can't keep with this, all of my hopes and desires have been smashed into pieces and I'm too lasy and uninterested to pick up the shards. Even if I tried, cuts would litter my hands and that wouldn't be good, would it? I don't know, just wanted to vent to nobody in particular because I can't trust anybody in the real world. maybe I'll keep this thing up, who knows. my mother would find it if written on paper and I don't want her to remind how much of an ungrateful freak I am. All the missed opportunities and distanced people never really allow me to forget my edginess (sorry in advance if edginess isn't a real word). anyway, ahaha, you're so sexi, don't kill yourself."
1535,Sick and depressed,"Lost my will to fight back. Mentally I'm strong, but my body could no longer endure it. Even if I somehow miraculously recover, I have to restart everything from zero. I'm growing older now and there's no way I could recover back all the years I've lost. I guess this is it  Farewell, sorry and thanks for everything."
1536,I'm so sorry everyone,"Just like most people here I'm suicidal too. I'm just too scared to act on it. Reading these stories here made me cry because I understand wanting the pain to end. My most recent ex who broke up with me a few weeks ago because I was attempting suicide told me I was trying to manipulate her to stay with me, but I know, and most of the people here know that we just want the pain to end. Living does not feel worth it anymore. Every day feels like a pain and sleep doesn't last long enough to make the days go by faster. I was going through one of the worst panic attacks I've had in recent memory and it took a lot of effort just to stop myself from jumping out the window. I can't live with the constant anxiety and the feeling of impending doom 24/7. I called the suicide hotline for someone to talk to because I don't have anyone to talk to and the first time I called they hung up on me, the second time the lady sounded annoyed and kept yelling at me.

I know this is a weird statement, but I don't want anyone to die, I want everyone to be happy. Everyone here deserves their own happiness and its so heartbreaking reading all these posts about wanting to die. It's weird because me myself wants to die so I can finally be at peace. I keep obsessively messaging my ex to try to make up with her but she only leaves me on read. I know its pathetic to be suicidal over this, but I promise the constant anxiety and being people I love has proven to be too much pain to bear. I even am moving to her state to be closer to her in hopes that we can make up. I know my issues lie beyond this but that is the only thing that is keeping me alive for now. 

I hope everyone here finds what they are looking for, I know a lot of people here do not want to die, but they want the pain to stop. If the pain doesn't stop soon enough then I understand why suicide is the option. Even so I hope everyone finds the peace that they are looking for."
1537,I feel like the world wants me to never be happy.,"I had a very large post wrote, took me an hour but I decide to just go with this... Shorter, and rather then my story it is just my emotions..m



At some point in life I realized I became my own biggest enemy. I kept making stupid decisions after decisions, never learning from any of them, no matter the situation i got myself in and I realized I never learn.  Or well this is what I believe... Some where in my head. im so screwed up Im sobatoging my own life.  I have this hatred In my and I dont know where its from but its so far deep down inside, but Im pretty sure its hatred towards myself.   A hatred formed from many years of constantly feeling like I have not only let my parents down and my beautiful girlfriend... But mostly myself. I have made many horrible choices from drugs, to getting myself criminal charges and large debt over tiny stupid things from my own carelessness and anger, my depression... I feel like a prisoner in my own mind, In three years Ive become a person I no longer recognize in the mirror, instead I just look back in disgust. 
Lately, I feel like the world would be better if I vanished, my mother could live without worrying of my problems and if her son will be behind bars  no more, and my girlfriend can find a man who treats her far better then I ever have.
Im so torn and mentally exhausted the my mind runs at a 1000 miles an hour with nothing on it... Just blank. I sleep all the time, but yet I dont sleep  ever.  I feel alone, more alone then I ever have in my entire life. 

The other day I walked into the woods and held a blade too my throat, if not for hearing the voice of two older people walking the path near by  to me and spooking me I dont believe Id be here today.. I fully intended on ending my life that night.

Im stuck, Fincally broke, facing criminal charges without the means to obtain a lawyer, trying to escape addiction, Dealing with mental illness and I dont know where to go.  
I shut off whenever I try to open up, Ive attempted therapy and group sessions.  I shut off,. Incapable of opening up and just bottling it all in.

I dont know where Im going with this or exactly what the point is to anything Ive said... but currently I dont know how much more value I can put into others before deciding just ending it is better then not hurting others.... And how lonely I feel."
1538,I wish my parents didn't love me so I could kill myself in peace,
1539,im either going to kill myself or run.,i can't stand being here anymore. everytime my parents even slightly rise their voice at me all i cn think is that they're going to kill me. they don't even physically abuse me (anymore) so there's nothing that anyone would do. i have three weeks to make up my mind
1540,Story to end suicidal thoughts,"It happened once. One man in America planned it—He wanted to know how people would react
when he was dead. So before his death, when doctors said that within twelve hours he
would die, he declared his death. And he was a man who owned many circuses,
exhibitions, advertising agencies, so he knew how to advertise the fact. In the morning
his agent declared to all the press, to the radio, to the television, that he was dead. So
articles were written, editorials were written, phone calls started coming, and there
was much commotion. And he read everything; he really enjoyed it!
People are always good when you die; you become an angel immediately because
nobody thinks it worth saying anything against you when you are dead. When you are
alive, nobody will say anything for you. Remember, when you are dead they will be
happy—at least you have done one good thing: You have died. 
Everybody was paying respects to this man, and this and that, and photographs had
come into the newspapers—he enjoyed it perfectly. And then he died, completely at
ease that things were going to be beautiful.
Not only do you need others in your life—even in your death . . . Think about your
death: only two or three persons, your servants and a dog following you for the last
goodbye. Nobody else, no newspapermen, no photographers, nothing—even your
friends are not there. And everybody is feeling very happy that the burden is gone. Just
thinking about it, you will become sad. Even in death the need to be needed remains.
What type of life is this? Just others’ opinions are important, not you? Your existence
doesn’t mean anything?!!!! 

Please drop that need, to be worthy, to be needed by somebody.

One thing, you need to be needed; you have a deep need to be needed. If nobody
needs you, you feel useless, meaningless. If somebody needs you, he gives you
significance; you feel important. You go on saying, “I have to look after the wife and the
children,” as if you are carrying them as a burden—you are wrong. You talk as if it is a
great responsibility and you are just fulfilling a duty. You are wrong! Just think, if the
wife is not there and the children have disappeared, what will you do? Suddenly you
will feel your life has become meaningless, because they needed you. Small children,
they waited for you, they gave you significance, you were important. Now that nobody
needs you, you will shrink. Because when nobody needs you nobody pays attention to
you; whether you are or not makes no difference.
The whole of psychoanalysis and its business depends just on listening. There is
nothing much, there is really nothing much in psychoanalysis and the whole thing around
it is almost complete hocus-pocus. But why does it go on? A man pays you so much
attention—and not an ordinary man, a famous psychiatrist, well known, who has written
many books. He has treated many well-known people, so you feel good. Nobody else
listens to you, not even your wife. Nobody listens to you, nobody pays any attention to
you; you move in the world as a nonentity, a nobody—and you pay so much to a
psychiatrist. It is a luxury, only very rich people can afford it.
But why do they do what they do? They simply lie down on the couch and talk, andthe psychoanalyst listens—but he listens, he pays attention to you. Of course you have
to pay for it, but you feel good. Simply because the other is paying attention you feel
good. You walk differently out of his office, your quality has changed. You have a dance
in your feet, you can hum, you can sing. It may not be forever—next week you will have
to come again to his office—but when somebody listens to you, pays attention to you, he
is saying, “You are somebody, you are worth listening to.” He doesn’t seem bored. He
may not say anything but even so, it is very good.
You have a deep need to be needed. Somebody must need you, otherwise you don’t
have any ground under your feet—society is your need. Even if somebody fights with
you it is okay, better than being alone, because at least he pays attention to you—the
enemy, you can think about him.
Whenever you are in love, look at this need. Look at lovers, watch, because it will
be difficult if you yourself are in love. Then to watch is difficult because you are almost
crazy, you are not in your senses. But watch lovers; they say to each other, “I love you,”
but deep down in their hearts they want to be loved. To love is not the thing, to be loved
is the real thing—and they love just in order to be loved. The basic thing is not to love,
the basic thing is to be loved.
That’s why lovers go on complaining each other...

If you have any past trauma PLEASE forget it, if we take half of your brain you will live wonderfully, not thinking about it, it is only your MEMORY that makes you suffer and feel less! 


PLEASE ALL watch this guys videos to FINALLY GET OUT OF THE SOCIETY TRAP and never feel bad about yourself! Love you all

you it is okay, better than being alone, because at least he pays attention to you—the
enemy, you can think about him.
Whenever you are in love, look at this need. Look at lovers, watch, because it will
be difficult if you yourself are in love. Then to watch is difficult because you are almost
crazy, you are not in your senses. But watch lovers; they say to each other, “I love you,”
but deep down in their hearts they want to be loved. To love is not the thing, to be loved
is the real thing—and they love just in order to be loved. The basic thing is not to love,
the basic thing is to be loved.
That’s why lovers go on complaining each other...

If you have any past trauma PLEASE forget it, if we take half of your brain you will live wonderfully, not thinking about it, it is only your MEMORY that makes you suffer and feel less! 


PLEASE ALL watch this guys videos to FINALLY GET OUT OF THE SOCIETY TRAP and never feel bad about yourself! Love you all

1542,Never knew it would be like this,Never thought I would live to be 19 and soon 20. Always thought I be dead by now. It still feels like I'm going to die any day now and it's only getting worse.
1543,I'm tired of this bullshit. My life will never get better.,"I plan to kill myself soon. I don't really want to die but I don't know any other way to stop hurting. My narssistic mother pulled me out of school when I came out as trans. It's been over 2 years since I've talked to anyone even close to my age. I have lost almost all of my social skills so even if I try to move out, go to school, get a job, etc. I will have no idea how to interact with the real world. I have no car( I wasn't allowed to get my permit until I was 17) and no one in my family is willing to drive me to take my G.E.D so even if I wanted to move out I can't because most jobs require you to be finished with high school. This situation is never going to get better and I'm fucking tired of people telling me it will. I have no good reason to continue dealing with this bullshit. No one will miss me anyway all I do is take up space. Even when I am dead I'll just be a waste of a grave"
1544,How do I make myself better guys,"Finding it hard to deal with existing in the past while. I do all of the 'right' things, I exercise a lot. I try to eat healthy but my motivation for cooking is declining. I have a job and a boyfriend who is normal and caring. I find it hard to handle a lot of social interactions because I feel like people would enjoy it more if I weren't around. I feel like this is backed up by not being invited to things happening in my social circles. Most recently not invited to my boyfriends friends wedding (his ex was invited). I feel more and more isolated. I keep thinking about suicide and how nice it would be to not worry about everything. I have gone to a counselor about this, he told me to go to a doctor so I did that he told me to go to a psychotherapist, but all of the ones I've contacted are booked out. It is so hard for someone feeling bad to go through those steps. I have tried to lightly mention to some close friends I've been feeling unusually bad but they avoid talking about it and possibly feel like they are avoiding me more. 

I grew up in a very dysfunctional and abusive home. My immediate family members all struggle with addiction. Meth, alcohol and gambling. It has continued to dysfunction in adulthood for my younger brother. Everything feels weird. I just really want to feel normal again. 

I can't explain what upsets me in particular. Sometimes something small and irrational will set me off and I will get overwhelmed with everything. I am almost 30. I felt like I dealt with everything better when I was younger. I think being more vulnerable to people (my partner) has made me more unstable. I found everything easier when I had more of a guard and assumed everyone would let me down. 

Sorry this is so terribly written I just had to put it down somewhere."
1545,i think i have a problem,"that's probably an understatement tbh. but im obsessed with dying, suicide specifically. i get jealous and depressed when i hear news of it. i get obsessed with the person but moreso their death. which i know is awful. i dig through reports looking for every grisly detail.

it makes me feel weird and guilty. i used to be part of the r/selfharmpics community way back when. they have a website now, and even though the mods want it to be a place of support and growth its a place to fester. my self harm got worse and worse there, seeing peoples reactions to it fed it more, i wanted to see that i was doing it ""well"" and ""right"" and that my sh was bad enough to care about. i got jealous of people who could inflict worse injuries on themselves and i tried harder. now i feel ashamed because i managed to hold off for now.

i ended up in the hospital, not exactly related to my injuries. it was a cold place. i was fitted with medications and given a plan for when things got bad. but they never stopped being bad. and when they were better, i got very afraid.

i dont know how to live without that deep dark emptiness. i dont know who i am without it. i want it back every time it leaves, even though i hate it. it has such control over me now more than ever. i havent sh'd since before i was hospitalized, but i want to. ive wanted to every day, i think about it constantly. i dont know if i even want to make it through the year.
i stopped taking my meds a few weeks ago, and i havent seen my therapist or my case manager. i dont know if i want to go back though.

this wasnt supposed to be an explanation, what i really wanted to ask was if anyone else feels like i do. does anyone else obsess over death that way? or, does anyone else relate to these things? i feel alone"
1546,I think I'm gonna finally kill myself soon,"No one in my life cares about me ever since I started being myself a bit more and even my own girlfriend has seemed more distant lately. I have no purpose, no talents, I have nothing in this world that is of worth. I've decided I'm just gonna end it after years of having suicidal thoughts so that I can finally be at peace. I hope that anyone else reading this who also feels these sorts of things either finds peace within themselves or finds a different way to get a better life rather than being stuck feeling like a fucking piece of shit like I am. 
Best wishes to all of you"
1547,I'm beginning to feel that it's imperative that I die,"Aside from, depression and my life being genuinely terrible, I've found my mentality growing more and more toxic and my mental health rapidly declining. I've become very misanthropic but not just that lately I've been irrationally angry 24/7. My desire to kill others has been increasing and I've clearly been developing mental disorders. I get insanely paranoid to the point I can't sleep, my memory is fucked, random hysterical laughing fits and I hear things. I think all the psychotropics I was on ended up working against me, went from simply being bipolar to this. I'd love to die before I end up hurting someone else. While I still have enough sanity left in me."
1548,Help,Please. Please
1549,I'm still contemplating. And suicide is looking like a great answer.,"I've been contemplating committing suicide for years now for many different reasons, and I think I may soon.

I just quit my job recently so i wont be having income, unless one of the other employers I applied to hire me (which I doubt). I'll be getting my final check soon which I can use to buy a gun. 

I dont want to grow old, I dont want to watch my mother get old and inevitably die. Life is just... horrible, for lack of better words. 

I'm scum. If It were up to me I'd sit inside all day, eat and gain even more weight and play video games. But we live in a society that we have to slave away our lives for currency in order to have a place to live, buy food/beverages. 

If you tell me that you enjoy life, I will never truly believe you. How the fuck can anyone enjoy being alive. Theres nothing I've experienced that made me happy about being here. It feels like I'm forced to keep going because If I dont then I'm a disappointment to everyone. 

I cant even act like myself because of our society being hateful towards anything other than social norms, and just because of crippling anxiety/depression. Everyone judges eachother and if you say you dont you are a liar. 

Fuck this world

I dont know what happens when you die but I hope once the trigger is pulled I wont have a consciousness."
1550,My boyfriend’s ex wife said it’s karma that our son passed away,"Me and my boyfriend had our son Halo on 07/31/19 and he passed away from SIDS on 09/13/19. My boyfriend’s ex wife said it’s Karma that Halo passed away because he wasn’t paying attention to her and her kid as much anymore because he was helping me adjust to my mom life and us with a new baby boy. I just found this out right now that she said that and I can’t stop crying. My baby boy didn’t deserve to die. How could someone be so evil? I’ve been suicidal for years and the fact that my boyfriend said to let it go...how could I even let that go? I feel like I’m better off just dying from a heroin overdose and being with my son and holding him and nursing him if there is a heaven. I can’t stop crying, I want to end my life right now. Nobody understands my pain. Not even the father of our son, who’s baby just passed away."
1551,can someone just hear me out:,idk i need to vent. i feel like an attention whore even posting here but I think about it a lot. Its been tough. I guess even posting here means I dont really want to right. I just want to hear someone else who thinks these thoughts but is confident in not going through with it and has control
1552,"Death is better than life, death makes me feel something life never has - happiness","I have no money

No job

Live in shit poverty stricken place with no opportunities 

All my aspirations are gone due to this place 

I’m good looking but can’t have a gf due to my mental state and also because only one has ever made me feel a certain type of way

Death gives me this feeling of euphoria and happiness knowing this will all come to an end.

Can’t see myself doing a shit generic job for a whole lifetime, therefore there’s no place for me here.

Christmas is approaching and if that ain’t a good enough reason to die I don’t know what is.."
1553,I’ve never had a women ever like me and I’ve tried to kill myself because of a lack of Tinder matches on three occasions. I’m studying in Indonesia (a poor SE Asian country where I’m taller and richer than every other man and Westerners are rare) and get dates constantly. Fuck going back home.,"Why the fuck should I go back home? This is the only country where I’m actually able to date. I’m going to have the time of my life, then hang myself in my dorm on the last day of this one-year study program so I don’t have to fly back and return to never getting matches on Tinder and having girls in clubs refuse to dance with me."
1554,"I've decided, I'm going to kill myself.","Why am I posting this? Attention? Yes, I do like attention. Things keep piling up and I have a plan, I'm gonna begin my process now, it should take a few days for it to work. Try to talk me out if you want. I can't fucking do this anymore. It's this or I kill others."
1555,I lost my first kiss today to someone I don't like. *On the verge of seriously attempting*,"To me, ever since I was younger, my first kiss was the most important thing to me ever. Virginity or anything didn't matter but a first kiss? I'm relatively young and I just lost my first kiss to my best friend who I am dating for no reason other then I feel sad. She asked me out and I said yes, I am not attracted to anyone, men or women, sexually or romantically. I already almost attempted suicide, I talked myself out of it. Or harming at least. I almost swallowed an entire bottle of mouthwash, I've relapsed on self harm, I can't look at my body without crying. I feel horrible. She kissed me, and she did it a few more times today. I held a knife to my wrist, I think I'm gonna do it. Or I'm going to kill her. I can't get this out of my head. How her lips felt, I feel almost violated. I didn't really consent nor did I deny it. She just did it and I acted like it was fine. I feel like smoking or drinking or anything. Swallowing shampoo. Slit my throat. Why shouldn't I kill myself?"
1556,Not being worth anything to society?,"I think, because i have a disorder that does not allow me to work and i'm kind of a social guy, that wants to contribute, it makes really hard thoughts to overcome.  
Actually life somehow tells you ""You are not needed anymore"".  
What would you do, before this leads to suicidal thoughts?"
1557,Comfortable being Suicidal,Im so used to being depressed and suicidal that I don't know how or what to do. I havent had any form of exercise in months. I wake up and sit infront of my computer all day in a small dark room. Im only 17 yet it feels like my body is gonna turn into a pile of mush. Im starting to gain weight again and no matter how much I hate myself for it I keep eating. All I do is dissappoint and I know that theres no point in trying anything because I have zero talent and will always fail. Trying to escape my mindset is too hard and Im more comfortable suffering than actually changing. Im also too afraid to kill myself. Ive had a noose tied around my neck ready to go but I just stop and my mind goes blank. I hope that someday my shitty lifestyle will lead to me getting cancer like my dad and killing me slowly and painfuly so that I don't have to do it myself. But maybe Ill have a too many bad days in a row and finally put an end to it.
1558,“I wouldn’t killmyself because of my family “,"Why is that the only reason 
To me nothing matters anymore I woke up today thinking like everybody is nothing we’re told I’m science as little kids that we’re less then a spec in space if that’s  All we are then nothing matters nothing is real"
1559,What is the most effective way to kill myself ?,"i've been thinking about killing myself for months now, but never really did anything to make it happen, because my parents would find me and i'm scared it would kill me father, who has a Heart condition. i kept it a secret for months until i started noticing a change in my behaviour, i became very jealous and i was bossing my boyfriend around very often. he couldnt take it anymore and told me. that's what made me realise what i was becoming. 
 I really dont have any friends, so i told him about my suicide thoughts and what i was going through, since two of his Friends are depressed, he's used to hear these kind of speaches i guess. It didnt affect him that much maybe not at all. It broke my heart.
 My country is going through a lot lately with fake elections and stuff like that, i don't really know what is really going on since i was focusing on keeping myself alive, but my boyfriend has really been following every detail of what is happening, and honestly he cares so much more about this country than he cares about my being alive or fine. He cries watching people talking about our country but doesnt feel anything when i cry myself out in front of him telling him how much i want to end it all, telling him about the window i keep open at night in case i wanted to jump. I just wanted him to feel a bit of my pain and understand.
 Today is my 19th birthday, and his friends, who i thought were my friends too, forgot about me, and i got in a fight with him (my boyfriend) about him not caring enough about me, i broke up, he hung up on me after insulting me. I cried all night, i am exhausted, i can't get up.
 I am so hurt, i litterally feel my heart breaking, he is the only reason i'm staying alive and for him i am no one. I could just dissappear it wouldn't change a thing in his life.
 I am ready to end it, i just don't know how.
Please, what is the most effective way to kill myself?"
1560,I’ve gave up on myself,"I don’t know when it’s gonna happen but I just know it will , I’ll start feeling like I’m getting better but in the back of my head I still think about it , it’s just something I can’t shake anymore , the hatred I have for myself is just saddening, I’ve been abused , abandoned, shoved from place to place &amp; never felt like I had value , but honestly the number one thing that scares me is losing my father he is the ONLY person in my life who has never left my side &amp; I feel like who ever loved me , he’s getting older now and I CANNOT handle losing him , like I said he’s the only person who’s never left . I wish I could just sleep for the next 20 years , I don’t see me making it much longer , I’m so sorry to the little girl I use to be who had so many hopes and dreams but I guess life had different plans &amp; I let myself down but I hope I can finally find some sort of peace on the other side.  That’s all I’ve wanted for a very long time."
1561,Cool,Looked at the new bill and it looks like I don’t qualify. So back to the old fashioned way
1562,I’m a horrible person,Posted on relationships and got told I’m emotionally manipulative. Someone said I was worse than my fiancé that cheated on me. I feel like I should have ended it and that makes me feel even more horrible and guilty. Maybe I shouldn’t have posted there. I feel even worse. I just wanted people to talk to. I should have cut my wrists deeper or tried again when he told me he was happier with me. I’m such an idiot. I guess I’ve proved everyone right that I’m a horrible person and no one should feel sorry for me. Sorry for being a burden.
1563,the funniest shit happened today,"i ordered rope on amazon yesterday, it was supposed to arrive today. my balance is empty and i made sure i ordered it correctly. it didnt come. apparently there was some sort of mix up now its being returned because they though it was cash on delivery even though i clearly have the reciept for it. 

now, i know what youre thinking. maybe this is a sign i shouldnt kill myself. id like to think so, but now that its come to this im going to be evicted from my home and i dont have anywhere to turn to. im not really sure if this is better."
1564,Wanna go to sleep but dont,"I am tired, I cant sleep due to insomnia so I will need to take melatonin that's beside me but I also wanna overdose severely and not wake up. So I also don't wanna take it, I just cant make up my mind."
1565,I told my therapist about my suicide plan.,"I started going to therapy about two months ago and I really like my therapist. We talked about most of the problems I have, but I was always uncomfortable talking about suicide. That was until yesterday when I decided to tell her that I have access to a gun and I was really thinking about using it. We set up a safety plan together and she sincerely thanked me for telling her. This is far from the end of my suicidal thinking, but it was a big accomplishment for me to open up like that to her."
1566,I just want someone to know about me.,"I'm honestly afraid to kill myself but I can't imagine living like this forever.  A lot of days I hope things fall apart and I finally have the final piece.  Every day is so hard.  I don't know how to do anything except get out of bed and make it through the day.

I just want someone to know about me and hopefully care.

I feel like I failed my mom when she was dying.  That's my biggest regret.  That and not having any family for a long time.

I want to be a musician but I'll never learn. I love piano and music boxes. I struggle with adhd/bipolar. I wanted to live on a farm in alaska but I also hate the cold.  I wanted to be a social worker so I could help people.

I thought I had more to say but I guess... unironically... what's the point in continuing on."
1567,I hope this helps someone,"I may not understand your story but I can relate been fighting my own demons for years but if I'm hear still holding on then you should hold on too, always keep your focus strong, I know times get difficult but them times are also pivotal, people believe in you I believe In you even when your feeling worthless"
1568,"I have a final exam tomorrow and if I fail the course, I've decided that I'm going to end it.","the good news is that I only need a 38% on the test to pass the course, it is out of 102 marks, so like 39/102. If I fuck up again, fuck it. I don't care about what anyone I know will think because I'll be dead lol. Guess we will have to see tomorrow if it fucks me and what my grade will be in 4 days from now."
1569,Idk,What do you do when everything you try always fucks up? When you have no talent at anything? When even the things you enjoy you fail at and ruin so nothing brings you joy anymore. When you can't scrape together even enough motivation to look out for the people you love? I would end it if i had the guts which i don't think i ever will
1570,This is it,"Chugged a fifth of whiskey, about to take all my sleeping pills. Goodbye"
1571,Update to video of me in a porn post in /r/legaladvice,"I was going to update /r/legaladvice but the only thing I have to update is my state of mind.

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dp0ums/theres\_a\_video\_of\_me\_in\_a\_porn\_video\_going\_around/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dp0ums/theres_a_video_of_me_in_a_porn_video_going_around/)  

TLDR on previous post: Porn video of me and an ex started circulating at my med-school and nothing was done about it. 

A month since;

I spoke to the associate dean who offered me some kind words. She also offered to send an email (with my input) that explains how sharing the video could be a crime and suggested that I address the class on Facebook. I took both those suggestions; we worked out what to say and I posted it on our Facebook Group. 

A student commented basically making fun of me and accusing me of lying. The entire post was deleted within a few hours and two students from student government asked to speak with me. It was made all-so-much worse because one of the students who talked to me is close friends with the guy who made that comment. He told me I was being accusatory, so I replied that he only felt that way because his friends were the ones who spread the video. He then sent an email that I interpreted as an attack on my professionalism and character. I was supposed to have input on that email but they sent it without consulting me. I didn't say anything, I'm not surprised.

In an attempt to clear my innocence, I did my own sleuthing. I tried to trace back the video to find who first recorded it with some success. I found my ex on a cam-site. I found out about Instagram log-ins that weren't mine that happened at the same time as the incident. The more 'evidence' I piled up, the more I began to think I was full of shit. People aren't this elaborate, there's no scheme. I was getting paranoid and border-line delusional. At this point, I wanted it all to end. 

It's been a few weeks and things have more or less smoothed over. No one's mentioned it but it's *all I think about*. 

It's hard to make eye contact with the administration and my heart races whenever I go to any of the mandatory sessions. I'm finding it really hard to focus and I've been obsessed with finding the most pain-free ways to die. I'd be surprised if I wasn't on a government watch list by now. I've texted the suicide hotline only to back out a few seconds later.

I pulled myself out of everything, I was trivia master, I am no more, I was treasurer, I am no more, I was clinic coordinator, I am no more. I was just going to complete the things I've already committed to and blend in the background until the end of the year. Then I can go on rotations where no one knows who I am, where I can just shut up and do what I've worked so hard to do.

Today has been my first real day off since the incident. I find myself thinking of ways to end it. It would be easy, it would be frighteningly easy."
1572,I’m done,I’m tired of being a failure. I’m done with life good luck to all of you
1573,Life sucks. I wish I never existed.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e2l1c4/trying_in_vain_to_get_a_job_and_now_my_dad_is/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Above is a link to another post I did couple weeks ago about the situation I was in. Now I'm still like this but it's gone far worse.

I love my family, but my parents and sister make me the idiot of the family. I am the least smart in my family and it feels like I'm being treated that way. My dad is pushing too hard, and is very very impatient when it comes to doing something, like fixing a broken gate motor and forcing me to do the hard work, even though it's insured. My sister is abusive, calls me names, berates me at every opportunity to make me feel bad and when I want to talk to her, she swears and hurts me in a way that would drive someone to commit suicide.

Then, there is my mom, I told her I'm depressed, and having suicidal thoughts, but she doesn't give me hope and help when she yells at me and threaten to hurt me and go live elsewhere. I'm jobless for 2 years since college. Got no friends since school, my family seems to hate me and I am irrelevant.

WHY WAS I BORN? WHAT PURPOSE DO I HAVE IN LIFE? WHY DO I EXIST?"
1574,Arguments for life?,"Hello reddit, I dont want to live in society anymore and refuse to work. I was going to just kill myself but my integrity refuses to let me die with the decision being so easy to make. Let me explain:

I used to have a job and an apartment and a bunch of other things. The day to day grind kind of life most people live. I've always been impulsive and quit my job. I wasnt happy and I was never going to get anywhere with it. I told myself it would be an inbetween sort of thing until I found anything to work towards. No matter how hard I tried nothing ever came and I got more and more angry with everything. That is until I realized I had no obligations to stay. I quit. It was then I began to realize I was only alive because of the charity of others. I have no skills or desires of my own. I'm antisocial and lack the capacity to learn anything new. I realized I couldnt survive in this world and I'd never find success at this rate. So I accepted the consequences of my actions. I lived on the streets for about a month. I thought maybe when pushed into a corner I'd rise above and take control. I didnt. I felt nothing as I walked empty roads across every state I went through. Tired and alone I stayed. Eventually some business with a family member has popped up and I've been with them for the past month.

I'm ending my life on monday. I'd die without charity and I'm willing to accept that. I don't want to die necessarily and it will be hard to go through with it but I will. I dont feel like being a parasite until I get kicked out. Even as a parasite I'm anxious to end my existence. I want to end my life on my own terms but some part of me wonders why after all this time I've never gotten a good counter argument. I've never gotten any points towards the want to live category. Maybe I'm going paranoid but the decision feels too one-sided. I feel like the world itself is pushing me to do it and I want to feel like I'm making the decision to end it all. 

Tl;dr: I've decided to kill myself but the decision to do it feels so obvious I'm not sure if I'm actually making a choice. Any arguments to stay alive that I can think about and refute would be appreciated."
1575,Jury Duty,I have jury duty scheduled in a few months. I hate the dangerous city that I live in and I’m trying to move back home but am afraid of being dragged back. I’m thinking I might end up killing myself
1576,There has to be a way to overcome this fear,"I have come to a point where nothing else work for me,  only way for me to go peacefully is to jump off this very monster bridge,  not 1 but 4 of them within a few miles of drive. Shitty thing is being afraid of height and I want to overcome this but what would it take? 
I'm not going to be destroying anybody because I don't have anyone,  they are all gone so I'm going too but peacefully not during a rush hour holding up traffic for hours no non of that."
1577,I'm going crazy,"Life is so fucking hard and frustrating. And for what? I am 19 years old and should be having fun, but instead have been dealing with a barrage of shit for the past decade. I fantasize about packing up my shit and moving to the middle of nowhere, but I know for a fact I won't be okay out there either. 

Suicide is the way to stop struggling. And I want out now. But my immediate family (dad and 17-year-old sister) have also been dealing with the barrage of shit and are in no better place than me. If I kill myself, my sister will kill herself. If my sister and I both kill ourselves, my dad will be alone and will die from either alcoholism or lung cancer. I love them both and genuinely want them to be happy and I know that won't happen unless I'm here. But holy fuck I want to die."
1578,I need courage,"I’ve tried many different anti-depressants, been through therapy 2 separate times. 
Those helped me for the first few months, then at some point I just fell back into the cold, dark hole I was trying to climb out of. I tried distracting myself with school. But during my semester, I just felt like a zombie with a routine. Being so sad for so long has sucked all the hope out of me to the point where now I’m just a very miserable person.
When I die, the people I burden will live better lives. I just need to build up my courage to attempt this again. Hopefully it will be my last try."
1579,I don’t know what to do anymore about life,"I’m a 20 year old male and I’ve had depression for 8 years now. Just recently diagnosed with Persistent depression disorder, I take 100mg of Zoloft. It helps but on of the problems is sometimes I forget to take it or I run out and procrastinate about ordering more, and within in less 12 hours of not having it my mind goes back to that depressive state and I sit there and wonder “I’m supposed to live life this way, taking medication for the rest of my life. Then breaking down when I forget to take.” I tried therapy but I hate talking to someone who gets paid to listen to my problems. It doesn’t feel genuine. And I can’t get out of this mode of being in fear of finding happiness because I’m afraid I’m going to lose it. Like I don’t want to be in a relationship because i don’t want to know what life could be like, just to have it snatched away from me. And I know that’s part of life but my life has been this way since I was born. Getting these moments of happiness just to have it taken away from me. I can’t face the truth that life does that to you. And when I get to these low points, I lose all hope and can’t bare with the thought of living anymore. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve spent hours on the internet for advice but never came across anything helpful. So I’m hoping maybe someone on here can help me"
1580,Does it actually ever get better ?,"Does your mental health actually get better, please excuse my illiteracy and ignorance but I just gotta kno. I'm slow like kinda slow in the head about doing things or thinking about it right away and it sometimes makes me think bad about myself cause something that should've taken like a sec in my head takes like a min to actually put it together and I have a very short attention span so it makes it even harder to  
connect things together even now I just had to reread what I typed out cause I lost my train of thought. My mind just runs 24/7 and I can never seem to stop it it's like there's always voices saying things about me to me about me and I kno its me but then I believe it's true cause why not maybe it's true maybe I am annoying and aren't comprheanceve or how ever you spell the word or even if that's a real word I don't kno I can't even explain like how I feel but I kno its a bad feeling I get the occasional suicidal thought like today I was at work as a seasonal helper for delivery driver and I ride with the door open on my side and I just thought ""were not going fast enough to kill myself but maybe if he was driving faster the wheels might hit me better"" it wasn't exactly that but you get the big picture I don't kno I feel like my mental health is just really bad and its effecting me only in my brain and my body is just this thing I use to show people that I'm happy I mean it's not hard to fake it or even actually feel happy at moments but then I just get this bad cloud just hanging over me just waiting to rain on me and I kno to expect it cause It comes in waves I'll be feeling good and happy but then idk it just happens at random and I try not to think about it but then it gets worse I can never really wrap my head around it writing this made me feel a Lil bit better but I just wanna kno is this wave of sadness a regular thing or am I crazy I feel like I'm crazy and wanna end it all the time and then saying I don't wanna die but feeling it in me to do it and then talking myself out of it just to keep thinking about it i mean I kno it would hurt but it could be short and then nothing but withen that moment of hurt would i regret it or do I really wanna kill myself and to scared to do it but I like living and right now the job I like it I don't have to remember stuff had cause my driver reminds me of the house and how many I need to take so no math involved which is awesome I can be the muscle and get paid for that Im waiting for my first check cause then I'd have money for stuff but really I am ranting on. am I okay? Should I be worried for myself? Does your mentality get better ?"
1581,I shouldn't be home tonight because my suicide method is here and I'm feeling like using it but I don't have anywhere else to go. Yay me.,"I really don't have anywhere. I don't have any friends and I don't have any other family to talk to. I'd seriously go drive my car somewhere and sleep there but it's currently 18°F here so that's not an option either



These are the moments I wish I just had LITERALLY ANYONE in my life. But no. It's me and only me, me alone"
1583,Effective ways to induce coma?,Is there such thing?
1584,The only thing stopping me from ending it all is my dad,"My dad is my best friend in the whole world. He almost died two years ago but he recovered like the absolute badass he is. He is the kindest, most accepting, smartest person. He’s a doctor, but he is also an artist. The other day he drove three hours to my city to give me a hug and bring me a tea and help me study.  I can’t talk to anyone else like I can talk to my dad. I’m a clone of him in so many ways and he is my favourite person on this shitty fucking planet.

My sister was suicidal as a teenager and it was so hard on him, and he already worries about me so much even though he has no idea that I’m THIS depressed. It would fucking destroy him if I killed myself and that is the only thing fucking stopping me and it scares me because now i don’t have the escape route."
1585,Goodbye.,"If you read this I'm sorry that you felt like being like that with me, you'll fine just hold on and keep trying."
1586,Tried to contact Reddit support over something innocuous,"and noticed a way to ""REPORT SUICIDE/SELF-HARM"".   So, I reported myself.  I haven't been to work in two days, have hardly been out of bed.  I haven't called in.  I may be fired, which in my situation triggers nearly immediately homelessness.  I've been in similar situations, but this one is different.  I'm three thousand miles from my nearest friend and it's cold.  I could call for emergency help but being locked up in such a strange place is frightening."
1587,"I need to change my life, and attempting suicide is the only way I can think of.","This works out one of two ways:

1. I die, and all is well.
2. I survive. People realize and hurting and things drastically change.

I'm 18 years old. I graduated from high school in the spring, where I was happy and interested and had amazing friends and mentors. I got fired from my job this summer by people I loved and trusted. I went to college, made no friends, was failing my classes, and got so depressed that I left to take a ""gap year."" After I came home from college, my high school coach - a huge role model for me - told me not to come to events with my team; he's moved on. My friends from high school, now in college, have moved on. My friends still in high school has moved on. My family and I don't get along sometimes. My friends from my job have moved on. I have probably 4 friends, all of whom aren't too close and I talk to rarely, never face-to-face. I'm a fucking failure. I wish they'd see I was hurting and care.

I need something to change. I've been to therapy for 3 years. Yes, I've tried multiple therapists, the one I'm with is the best so far, but still not working. Yes, I'm on medication. Yes, I've tried hobbies and activities to ""find friends."" Yes, I've waited for time to fix things. A long, long, time. It hasn't. This is the last option. I know people will tell me ways to improve stuff, I really do appreciate it but I bet it'll be things I've already tried. This might not work, but it's my only shot. If I die, that'll probably be okay too; at least I won't even be able to feel devastated when no one shows up to my funeral, which they won't. I need support, I need to know I'm not human trash, unworthy of anyone to care or really anything. Let's do it."
1588,I'm scared.,"Today, I went deeper than ever before. Its like a drug for me, just cutting myself open, but it's the only thing that keeps me entertained. But I realized that I dont feel in control of my actions. In the heat of the moment, when I feel like shit, I could kill myself at any moment. Im scared of what I might do. I showed one of my friends, but know chance that theyll coax me out of this. I'm a stubborn fuck, and don't listen to anyones opinion when I have my mind set. My arm aches from some of the scars, and I finally hit blood today, too. It's just a matter of time before I snap, and finally end it."
1589,I saved someone from suiciding,
1590,Suicide watch,"Suicide watch...

So it isn’t for me, it’s for my girlfriend, she keeps saying she “can’t think of good things to out way the bad” which is what she did to help when she got depressed, (clinically)  she’s really behind in school, her friends have stopped hanging out with her, which is when I would say this started. And she just got on her period and that’s when things get hard because then she becomes in pain constantly and she keeps saying she can’t handle it anymore and that she can’t take it and I’m scared because idk if she might do something"
1591,"moving back to my abusive parents' place in four months, kinda losing hope if i was being honest.","i have a lot of mental illness that prevents me from being independent and living on my own, on top of being disabled. i was able to move away from them when i started college and lived with my grandma, aunt and uncles (my grandma's sons and daughter) but everyone is moving out and they're selling this house which means i'm forced to go back to my parent's place. my stepdad is mainly the reason for all my ptsd (i was abused as a kid by him, all the way to me graduating highschool) and my mom would fight with him about it but its not like my mom can leave him because she probably loves him and he's her source of income. i acquired a job after art school (community college because no way in hell my stepdad would pay for my tuition) anyways it was going well for me, worked for four years at home because that was home based but you know, the company shut down this year and i'm just here like. too mentally ill to do anything.  


idk man ive just been thru a lot of shit this 2019 i guess im just dumping it all here i just get anxiety thinking about coming back lol like ""i'd rather hang myself before that happens"" been having a lot of these psychotic intrusive thoughts that are more fucked up than my normal suicidal thinking too nidk i just want it too end i guess because its not like i can get on my own two feet not like my aunt and uncles can allow me to live under their roof im just kinda a waste of space its kinda sad when you think about how no one wants to support you, at least i have my mom and grandma. but we're dirt poor and idk, unless i get the mental and physical help i need i wont get better. life just sucks a lot. i wish i can just get up and get a job do my shit but its easier said than done especially if you live in my country with the debilitating disabilities and crippling mental illness i have, i just wonder why god hasnt killed me yet to end my suffering"
1592,"I've been unable to get a college its killing me I've stayed 2 years home preparing but I just cannot push myself to study hard and have lost ""the fear"" that gets you going. I'm unusually calm in all situation no matter what. By the end of the month I think I'll leave forever",
1593,I have everything planned out for tomorrow,"Long story short I’ve been dealing with depression for about 10 years now. I attempted suicide a few years back and was found and cut down. Because of the seriousness of the attempt people did seem to care but after a few months that ran its course and the novelty of having a depressed friend wore off and people stopped caring. I started my own business and tried to make somewhat of a life for myself but the problem is for the past year or two I really haven’t even had a friend. I have absolutely no one to talk to even to just have a basic human conversation. The past few months this gnawing loneliness has been eating away at me as I wait for someone, anyone, to ask me to do something or to talk. And I have tried to reach out to people but most times they don’t even respond or if they do they are busy etc. I’m not going to send a mass text saying “Talk to me or I’m going to kill myself”. It’s clear no one actually will miss me, or if they do they miss the idea of me or something because no one wants to talk to me or spend time with me. Anyway, I have all of my possessions packed up and my apartment clean and tied up loose end. Tomorrow I’m going to pick up a bottle of some decent whiskey and a pack of cigarettes, and start drinking around noon. By 10pm assuming no one has reached out to me (they won’t), I’ll be hanging myself and ending the constant pain that has been my joke of a life. Cheers"
1594,Life threatening emergency,Wanna know why I’m suicidal? Because I just survived a life threatening emergency and called literally 20 people to help me and it went to voicemail for all of them.
1595,Why?,"Why go on, without knowing anything about me or mine, tell me why."
1596,Whats the point,"What is the point in living if I have nothing to live for.  I have no friends, no family, and no future.  Why live?"
1597,My (22F) Boyfriend (23M) of 8 months didn't come see me in the hospital after a failed suicide attempt,"So i overdosed on some pills with the intention of dying but got cold feet and checked myself into the nearest hospital. Fortunately, I was on time and they were able to treat me.

On the road to being fully detoxified, I was place in critical care under a 24 hour watch from nurses as well as a 72 hour psychiatric arrest.

Only a few people had know what happened and were aware of the whole truth (all of which came to visit me)

My boyfriend of 8 months never showed up (granted he was texting me a lot)

I was released early from the hospital earlier today and haven't heard from him since.

I'm a bit heart broken right now because he was a really big reason i decided to live (not that im saying that he should be obligated) but i really thought we were end game so im trying to see things from his perspective.

Anybody have insight or experience something similar? I would ask him but he hasn't responded for a while now and im losing my mind here lmao.

Edit: he is in medical school and is currently on rotation where he gets home kind of late. I thought this was a good reason not to visit until my best friends pointed out that i actually almost died.

TL;DR
i attempted suicide and was kept in the ICU for 3 days. My boyfriend never came to visit."
1598,Hope.,"Funny word, isn't it? People always say to hope for a situation to end, or hope for it to get better. Hope for life to improve. ""It always gets better!"" ""You'll be ok! Just be happy!!!"". I'm trying to believe that, but in all reality, I don't know if I can. Life has been hell for years for me. Life hasn't gotten better, it's gotten worse. Going from being assaulted, physically and mentally all my childhood, to being assaulted mentally and physically as a young adult. I'm sitting here, questioning if I even fucking matter. If hope even really exists. I'm sitting here, alone, wishing it would all just stop. Drugs don't help. The pain I put myself in doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm just done. So fucking done..."
1599,Just. Tired.,"

I'm tired of family issues and being the black sheep that almost everyone hates due to a narcissistic mother that gets them to turn against you for the fun of it. Luckily I still have my dad who isn't as dumb as the rest.

I'm tired of mental abuse.

I'm tired of a world where the bad is outweighing the good.

I'm tired of seeing so much hate.

I'm tired of seeing our planet dying and not enough is being done to tackle the issues.

I'm tired of waking up and repeating the whole suicidal thought cycle every single day.

I'm tired of modern society in general.

I'm tired of having to ""suck it up"" and just ""deal with it"" when it comes to asking for help.

I'm tired of existing.

I'm tired of being too cowardly to end my life due to the fear of pain.  But maybe someday i'll finally snap and I won't be that scared to do it anymore.

Writing this makes me feel even worse because I know that there are many others out there that has it much worse than me. Hell, I can't even think straight anymore. I don't really want much in life honestly. I just want 2 things.  
1. Is to see my dad happy and free from all this toxic family politics. 
2. If i can find a way to do so, i'd honestly just want to dedicate my whole life to cleaning oceans or any polluted areas in the world. 

As soon as I put my phone down for a break, it'll either be back to staring at my suicide note and plan or trying to hold on as much as I can until I snap someday. Who knows? I just know i'm sick of existing when there's no reason for me to even be here in the first place. I wished I didn't care so much about everything, but dumb tiny me still does. Fuck I wished I had the guts to kill myself now honestly, even i'm sick of my own rambling. Thank you to those who took the time to read these rants.."
1600,petty roommate drama is apparently enough to send me over the edge,"overheard my roommate telling a few of her friends that i'm not who she thought i would be, that i always acts weird and says weird things. she's definitely right, i just didn't think she would ever do this to me. she thought i was sleeping- i was about to go to sleep, actually, but now i'm looking at my pills and wondering if i should just take the whole bottle and ruin her weekend a little bit."
1601,Occult suicide,A means to an end. Already dead and full of despair so dabbling with the occult might be my golden ticket to getting the hell off this planet. It's not like I have six bottles of neumbutal.
1602,Wanting to die but I can’t,"I’ve had manic depression for years, suicidal ideation included. I thought once I was out of my abusive household and medicated the thoughts would go away but they haven’t. I still have a strong urge to kill myself. Tonight it came from no where and I have no outlet. So here I am. 

I’m not afraid to die, I genuinely want to. Before what was stopping me was my family but I’ve moved away. Now it’s my job, I take care of the elderly as a personal support worker. However, it’s just not doing enough at least not for tonight. I just don’t know what to do. 

I know better than to give in to the suicidal parts of myself but eventually this nightmare has to end, right? 

I’m not in danger, I don’t want anyone to panic I don’t have anything in my apartment I could feasibly kill myself with. But I’m really struggling.."
1603,I'm planning to kill myself in a few weeks,"I've tried it 2 months ago my third time and it failed miserably and I was sent to a mental hospital. I want to think this one thoroughly this time and not fuck it up. This girl I really like is sneaking into this guy's house that I really hate at night and I'm really scared that he's going to making a move on her but I'm done at this point I can't have her I can't be happy everything hurts. I can't keep faking my retarded smile anymore I fucking hate it I just want out of this world. No one understands me but her. I hate it, I hate it all I just want to sit down and smoke a joint without feeling like I'm getting screamed at in the face. I'm scared, I'm so scared I don't want to die I'm scared of dying but I don't want to be alive I don't want this anymore I hate school I hate it so much it feels like I'm suffocating. More and more it gets worse and worse everything hates me and I hate it I hate it all. If this world doesn't want me here then so be it."
1605,I can't do this anymore,"It's been three months of constant thoughts of suicide and I don't know if I'm posting this because I want to be stopped or I'm doing it to vent.

I broke up with my girlfriend which made me lose one of my greatest friends. He's not a great person and I say that as in he's not perfect. I vented to my ex about him and a load of drama that occurred over the past three months and she told him. He confronted me about it today and told me that I'm an abusive person, and I ran away on the brink of tears because I've only been trying to fix everything. He later texts me ""you are going to keep my name out of your mouth and you are going to stay away from me and my girlfriend. consider this a warning."" 

I'm wanting to cut but my boyfriend said he'd cut if I did so I'm not. I promised him I would make it past Christmas. I know it'd kill him if I did this and I know it's not the only option but I'm at my limit. I can only handle so much and I've reached so far past that point these past few months I can't handle it anymore I just can't. I'm going to kill myself in January as far as I'm concerned right now."
1606,Last 24 Hours Of My Life,"I’m going to basically document my last day. I’ll update this post until I commit suicide. Hopefully this works out.

12:16 AM - It’s kind of weird how in less than 24 hours I’ll be dead. I’m honestly not scared just nervous. I’m going to listen to some Pearl Jam and head to bed. Night."
1607,Don't know how much longer I'm going to be here,In the long term I don't see my life turning out that good. Maybe I'll have a few good times in the following years but I have this feeling I am going to die young and I'm kind of comfortable with it. Good things usually don't work out long term in my life. An example would be someone comes into my life but then I inevitably push them away. Another example is I have such a great opportunity that I to advance in life that I inevitably waste. I'm starting to feel like I should get out of this world while I'm young so i don't have to experience most of my life in pain. I don't know how I'm going to die whether it will be an accident or on purpose but just thought I would share these thoughts I'm having.
1608,Thinking about suicide comforts me,I don’t drink or have any other way to deal with my problems. And no matter what I eventually always end up in this state of mind. I’m so stupid I can’t even learn how to tie a noose right. If I died who would care? Or if people found out I was depressed I’m sure they would just move on with their life. I’m sick of being a burden.
1609,What sleeping pill can I use to OD on because iv lost everything dear to me...,"So... I'm a 28 year old man who has lost everything he had, my family my exgirlfriend whom I have 3 wonderful kids with (2 boys one 2 and one 4 and a 11year old who isn't mine but still consider him my son) I have a GED but that has done nothing for me I had a job but wasn't good enough for my family we lost our apartment and starting living with her mom after sometime we grew distant fought more and more and she decided it was my time to leave and end our 5 year relationship... I didn't want to but something told me I had to for the kids sake I have a very high depression level that I can not seem to manage anymore and I'v decided to end everything so I don't have to harm my family anymore then I already have I have failed as a father and a person to everyone and I don't wanna be in this depression anymore..."
1610,"Weird but, does anyone want to have a group voice call?","Just to talk about life, what’s making us suicidal/ feel suicidal, and to provide support for each other. The only rule is to try to refrain from being ignorantly optimistic (*cough* prolifer’s). 

If you’re interested pm me :)"
1611,everything feels unreal sometimes,"when i look around, nothing feels real. i don’t feel anything. when people talk to me, i don’t smile anymore or react. everything seems still."
1612,Make girlfriend makes me want to commit suicide..,Sadly I still exist on this planet of dread and pain.. This person I'm with drives me to complete insanity.. She makes me want to end my life so bad.. I wish someone would shoot me in the head tomorrow when I go to work.. Maybe ill be lucky enough to die in a horrid car accident.. I need help to escape this nightmare I am trapped in please any advice is welcome.. Maybe ill just die in my sleep tonight.. I wish God would answer my prayers and take me...
1613,My Mom Saw My Cuts,"My mom saw the cuts on my wrist. I told her I tripped yet I had just gotten the same cuts on the top of that arm and said I tripped that time. So I basically ran into my room and my dad followed me and he asks “are you cutting yourself?” I said “NO” and then he kept asking what it was I finally cane up with the lie that I cut myself with paper clips in school instead of bitting my nails. 

Then I had to go to swim practice and my mom drove me and she talked for a long time about what I’m going to do she kept asking if I did this out of boredom or if I’m depressed I said I did it out of boredom.

Yea I feel like I’ve very much screwed myself in the future cause my mom says if I keep cutting my wrist I have to go to a theorist (I don’t wanna) 

So yea life is great 👍"
1614,I'm sick of this living business,"I have never been happy. I do not know what it means to be so. I feel like I don't deserve it. I'm too cynical to be helped with cliches like ""think positive"" ""talk to a friend"" or ""it's temporary."" I've been hating myself for the better part of 20 years and it's not going away it's only getting worse. Literally every day I wake up and say to myself, ""you should kill yourself. Everyone hates you and no one cares. You're a bad father and an even worse husband. If you weren't such a coward, your life would have been better but you've been fucking up since 2nd grade."" And other things similar but more specific.

 I have no friends to speak of, even online ones. People talk to me, but I rarely have anything useful or interesting to add to a conversation and all one on one talk is just small shit with my coworkers. All I ever think about us suicide and nobody wants to talk about that. I treat people poorly, as if they don't matter. I'm often brash and abrasive and some may even call me toxic. When I think about why I'm like this I cant find any emotion. I am often in this state of numbness and I feel like nothing matters at all, certainly not my death. I can think of ways the lives of the people who know me would get better with my permanent absence. Maybe I'll write it later. 

I have a large extended family with cousins by the dozens and none of them ever contact me. I assume it's because I'm standoffish and quiet at any gatherings. I wasn't invited for thanksgiving by anybody, but my father has agreed to let me and my wife and son stay for a couple days with him and his wife for xmas. 

I don't know what I want from life. In 5 years, I see myself as dead. This is how I saw myself 5 years ago and 10 years ago and 15 years ago. I am a food worker and am easily replaced in all facets of life. I live in section 8 housing on food stamps and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. My wife can't work because we have no-one to take care of our child. It isn't fair that everyone else gets to have families and friends and I was born with this inability to recognize a future for myself."
1616,Here I am living a perfectly good life yet I am killing myself.,What do I do huh. Somebody talk to me please?
1617,My friend is trying to commit suicide and I'm failing to talk her out of it . Help. She needs it and so do I.,
1618,You ever just feel like not existing anymore,"(Dont know if this is the right place to post but yea)  like wish you'd just die in your sleep 
Everything is going fine I have a job and stuff but I just kinda feel bored I can't make friends and have like no friends I procrastinate I can't remember crucial information I just can't do anything right and it's getting me down quite a bit and kinda wish I wasn't born or that I'd just instantly die"
1619,A thought,I wish I could trade places with the people who are dying but don’t want to
1620,The world is empty and everything is meaningless,"It’s like every social interaction is transactional. No one really cares about anyone but themselves. We lie to ourselves to keep from feeling alone but the feeling remains buried deep. I’m tired of being so sensitive and caring about people who don’t care about me, and i’m tired of seeing people treat each other like they’re disposable. I’m tired of feeling used and abandoned and always having my heart broken. Love is a lie that only leads to more loneliness. I’m tired of life."
1621,Anyone else wish they could hire a hit man for themselves?,"Throwaway account FYI.  But I don’t want to live anymore.  I’m 21M with an STD that I haven’t gotten diagnosed cause I’m scared.  

It sucks, I know I would never kill myself.  That would destroy my family.  But I wish I could pay a professional assassin to kill me within 6 months or something.

I don’t want to see it coming, I just want to be shot in the back of the head without knowing it.  Just poof, and be dead. 

Fml"
1622,I didn't consent to being born,The breeders have trapped me here. So I want financial compensation or I'm going to kill myself.
1623,I feel like I'm staring death in the face,I don't feel like I have a choice but to either die or live a painful life. There can be no success for me. I'm just not good enough to make friends with people and I never will  be. In life if you can't make friends than there is no hope. There is no hope. I'm not too stupid because I say I am. I just am. I cannot just let go and enjoy life like normal people. I never will be able to. I'm too weak. Everything effects me emotionally in a negative way. I can't do this. I was never meant to succeed. I just want it all to be over.
1624,"Instead, I think I'll just go to bed","I haven't slept properly in four days now.  I suspect I'm having a manic/mixed episode in that I can't sleep for more than an hour or two at a time but still want to kill myself.  I know I'm tired and that doesn't help.   

What does help tho, is someone I  met here.  They are forcing me to be more responsible and think of someone outside myself.  So maybe I'll just go to bed instead.   Maybe when I wake it will be better.  Just maybe"
1625,I've been wrong my entire life,"Continuation from this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ea0099/please_listen_to_me/

I guess I have the desire to end my own life because... Deep inside, I know I am probably rotten to the core, and I'm doing every single thing wrong. 

And now, I realized the kind of person I've become... A coward, a stupid, spineless coward. 

There are other people who want to die because of things beyond their control, something they didn't have the fault in the first place... But I'm the main culprit to almost everything that has happened to me in these past five years.

60% was my fault, and 40% was other's fault.

There are times when I've been envious at others because they could easily do what I've struggled my entire life, to connect with people, to get acceptance from others, to not have troubles and difficulties in life... That's everything I wanted...

I'm not someone who could've turned into a hero, or a person who could've protected others... Instead, I'm just a faker, who wanted to be accepted by others...

I know that I became like this because of the bullying other people did towards me... I didn't understand how true friendship was like. Aside from a few people who showed it to me, I don't really understand it in the first place, and since I grew up being bullied and manipulated at high school, when I got to college, I didn't know how to connect with others, and ended up dumping many chances.

Because, no one is going to wait for another person forever, and I was a narcissist for wanting people to wait for me until I tried to talk with them. 

I'm going to end this decade with insane amounts of regrets and failures... Sometimes I don't think how I will turn into a psychologist, since I don't really know how to understand other's people hearts...

I drove away many people, I mostly have superficial relationships with others, since I can't truly connect with them... Because my heart is broken.

That's why I want to die, I guess that's also why I started self harming in my left-wrist, I didn't want to face reality, but now, I have no other escape...

I endured a decade filled with conflicts, depression, broken relationships, hypocrisy, inmaturity and so on... I failed, I fucking failed, I'm not a hero, I'm just a misguided hypocrite..."
1626,I got enough courage to kill myself,"Before you read this, let me tell you this past year I lost all my friends, got terrible grades, drank alchohol, I can't function on a normal day without ADD, OCD, and antidepressant pills, and most of my family wanted to disown me.

Anyways I've been wanting to kill myself for the longest time but I was too scared because of death, and my mom would be sad. I've gained all my courage by going on r/2meirl4meirl, r/suicidewatch, alchohol, joji, and my grades. Tomorrow is my last day on this Earth, because I've been suffering for way too long and everything is stressful and I just want to go. If you're reading this, don't comment and say shit like ""don't do this"" or ""it will get better"". It only gets worse. I just wanted to spread awareness and hopefully get someone to care before I go."
1627,I’m only here to help my parents take care of my disabled brothers. That’s all I’m good for.,"I’m so mad at them every day. I’m mad at my parents for giving birth to us and I’m mad at them for caring about me and not letting me die and I’m mad at society because no one likes my brothers because they’re disabled and if they didn’t have me and my parents there would be no one to pay for their food and housing because nobody cares about them, not even the extended family. I wish I could just ghost them and drive the highway until I have no idea where I am anymore and then yank the wheel and fly off the road somewhere they’ll never find me. 

I almost did it with pillz last Monday but I chickened out. I told my dad and he said he would be so hurt and angry if I died that he would hate me forever. Big whoop. He’ll change his tune when he gets the money he would have spent to send me to college and uses it to buy caregivers for the brothers instead. 

I should have killed myself years ago. My youngest brother is 12. I should have done it a long time ago so he would have been too young to remember. 

I wonder if I could make them stop loving me so I wouldn’t have to feel bad about them losing me."
1628,Helping someone I know,"I’ve had my fair share of browsing through this sub for help when I felt emotions I thought I couldn’t control. But theirs a problem, my new-ish friend seems to feel the way I used to.

I want to help her but I believe she’s in the wrong. According to her, her heart was broken and she wants to kill herself. I’ve told her time and time again how valuable she is but she thinks otherwise. I’d love to say more but I can’t because it wouldn’t be true.

It seems her “heart being broken” was a rejection. Someone didn’t like her back and felt bad but she doesn’t feel the same way and thinks they hate her now. 

Although I believe that’s a somewhat drastic reaction to rejection, I don’t know what she’s gone through in the past and I’m not about to open new wounds without her being open to it. How do I help her? Any ideas would be appreciated, thank you."
1629,The world wasn't meant for me,"I'm 24. I have nothing in my life that proves life is for me. I'm still in community college after 6 (going on 7) years. I thought I'd finally be able to transfer this semester and move on with my life. To finish school and get a job like everybody else. I did so well this semester. I live at home. I got dumped by someone who truly loved me but of course I fucked that up too.

Some things weren't made for us. For me that's world."
1630,How do y’all fucking do it,How the fuck do you stay alive. How the fuck did I stay alive? Only to come to this place again? And again? And again? I can’t kill myself. But I’m ok letting someone else do it. Where can I go to make sure I can killed not just raped or left disabled or some shit.
1631,Any suggestions on help lines that WON'T make things worse?,"Like perhaps somewhere I can talk anonymously and not have a gun pointed at my face and 15 cops show up at my house to lock me down?

I can't go to a hospital, they do the same.  I've exhausted all my friends, and even my family just asking someone to talk to, and I'm in quite the rough situation.

If I can't find REAL ANONYMOUS help tonight, I think it's time to pull that trigger."
1632,ECT last resort,"I spoke with a new psychiatrist that offered to help me get into an inpatient ECT. My memory is already fairly poor so I'm sure I'll excitement troubles there but I don't know what else to do. I've already started the process of preparing the end my life. Getting rid of belongings, about to re-home my pets, doing research on suicide methods. My pets were a large part of helping me stick around but I feel like I'm tired of caring for them. Like, I love them but right now I find them to be incredibly tiring. It's best if they go on to a bigger and better home.  I am trying NOT to hurt myself until I do the ECT but it's really difficult. Especially this time of year."
1633,this shit is so pointless,"Honestly I'll never be happy. I keep lying to myself saying that things will get better and sometimes they do at least for a short time. I've been unhappy for long I don't even really remember what it's like to feel genuine happiness. I Fucking hate the holidays pretending I'm okay to family it's all fake they don't really love me anyways. I just want to disappear forever. I've tried to reach out to people in the past but It's always some ""it'll get better"" or ""pray about it"" bull shit. fuck this shit I'm so close to being out."
1634,I plan to do it,"I know I’ll do it one day I just don’t know when 

Everything just fucking goes to shit in the end doesn’t it? 

I’m lost. My depression has taken over so badly. I feel so alone all of the time. This world is an absolute fucking joke and I don’t know how to deal with it to be honest."
1635,Forced help...,"Does anyone ever feel like maybe the only way to save yourself is to attempt suicide and hope it forces you into getting help? You cant just reach out to anyone, but you're feeling so much tension  and it's about to bubble over..."
1636,What am I supposed to do?,"You know how every protagonist has a major overarching mission? Like saving their family or avenging the death of their father or finding shoes or just finding happiness. I feel like I know my mine: not killing myself. I know that I should aim for something more, but I can't even express how much of a challenge it is for me to want to stay alive. 

In times like these, I think about Virginia Woolf and how she was so desperate for death that she drowned herself in six inches of water. 

I want someone to prove me wrong one day and love me back to life, but i know love doesn't work that way. You either fix yourself or drown.

I'm not strong enough to fix myself, and I don't want to drag anyone down with me."
1637,Suicidal,"I want to kill myself but I don’t know how to.
I’ve tried overdosing but each time it fucks me over.
I don’t want it to be extremely painful. I just want it to be quick and easy."
1638,I'ma not die,When you are reading this I am still alive.
1639,I'm saying goodbye but I don't know how to actually...you know.,"I've said my goodbyes. But now, I'm a chicken and can't actually do it. Now, I feel like I have to since I said goodbye. 

Maybe I should just run away from home and hope I die? Idk. 

I'm too chicken to seek help either. I think it would be worse to be in a psych ward for Christmas. 

Isn't that fucked up logic?"
1640,i dont know anymore,"I really dont give a shit anymore, im done with this bs. I wake up like shit, go to school like shit, let people push me around like im shit, put on a fake ass smile so if im sad no one says shit, i go home like shit, take a shower and think about how much of a piece of fucking shit i am, then i lay in bed cutting my wrists trying to not feel this numbness anymore. I wanna end it all but im to pussy 2 do it. I tried over the summer, that was a fail bc someone texted me and i thought that was a sign that it wasnt my time. looking back on it now i shouldve ended it, i shouldve killed myself. I feel selfish when i wanna tell friends how i feel bc i dont wanna put my problems on top of theres, so i just feel alone most of the time. I can b in a room with a million people and i will feel lonely as shit, no matter how many people i surround myself with i still feel this FUCKING lonelyness inside. I started 2 feel this way about 1 year ago, i didnt know what i felt exactly so i just didnt bother, it started 2 escalate and then i started to cut my wrists and get all of these negative thoughts. If u were to tell me a year ago i would be having mental break downs and bad ass anxiety everyday i wouldnt have believed you. People would come to me last year bc they said they wanted 2 end it all bc they were numb, i thought they were crazy for wanting to end life, but now im 110% know how they feel. I dont have a fucking mom bc shes dead, people @ school think im crazy for saying ""My moms dead"" so freely, i was only 2 what do u expect. But deep down I fucking cry every night bc i think its my fault shes 6 ft. under. If my mom never had me she wouldnt have been worried to buy dippers and wipees and basically stress bc she had to take care of a baby. Its bullshit to bc my dads a drug addict that lost custody over me and my brother after my mom died bc he od on drugs. My grandma on my moms side only takes care of me and my brother 4 one reason and one reason only, its bc when my mom died me and my brother started to get checks, like CHECK CHECKS. Every night she talks about how we dont love her, that were pieces of shit, gifts from hell, and that we've been a burden in her life for the past 11 years. The summer of 2012 my grandma on my dads side got partial custody of me and my brother. Me and my brother would ask about our dad all the time and if she would let us see him, at the time im 4 or 5 and little did we know by the law we werent aloud to. Winter 2013 came around, my grandma tells my dad to come and drop milk off and say hi to me and my brother. She told him they would say my dad was my cousin. Eventually he couldnt bare the fact we didnt know he was our dad and not our cousin so he told us. He was my Best friend and I was his, i trusted him, i looked up to him, i loved him with all my heart. At my age i was his LITERAL tail, i would go with him EVERY WHERE. He stopped doing drugs for a little. Fast foward a little he starts doing it again, since im way to young to even know what drugs are i had now fucking idea y he would leave 4 such long periods at a time and when he came back my grandma would yell at him. He would leave @ like midnight or when my grandma would fall asleep and take me and say that we were gonna go 2 wawa or get something to eat, we obviously didnt. he would go to random peoples houses and get high with me in the car, i would ask him if we could go home and he'll say in a little bit or in a couple minuets. i was scared. He knew i was young so he took advantage of me and said dont say anything about were we went or that we went to my ""friends"" house. I listened to what he said bc i loved him. I obviously got older 1 year ago he got high at 4 am and started to act crazy. My brother tried to calm him down and shit but my brother eventually got pissed and was about to hit him, my brothers 14 teen years old so ig he thought it was his job to snap him outta this shit, my grandma called the cops and i called him and said i was done with this shit and having 2 deal with bullshit lies everyday, and having 2 feel alone all the time and all that shit. Fast foward to rn 9:45 pm, 12/13/19. My dad is ig better and lives in NewYork. I refuse to talk to him bc i have no trust with him anymore. The last words I told him was I want to see u dead. I feel the way i feel bc the shit ive been through, i feel numb, i feel pain, i feel lonely, i feel like ill be in a corner with no one 2 talk 2 4 the rest of my life. I really dont know how to escape this bottomless hole, i wanna die, i feel useless to this shitty ass world, I literally just lost a friend today bc i wanted 2 b an ass. I wanna kill myself, i dont want to feel this useless-ness anymore. Im only 13 years old and im writing this, for all the older people you could say its a faze, but to me this shit is forever, i really dont give 2 shits about how im way to fucking young to feel this shit and how i should go to a teacher or family member or some bull shit like that. Its really not how it fucking works, and if u thinks someones that dumb to go to a fucking school teacher and tell them all that shit well then honestly go fuck urself if u think telling someone u know jack shit about how u fucking feel and u wanna die every day and that u feel a numbness that weighing u tf down every single day of ur shitty ass life."
1641,Title,"I want to die, but I can't leave my mom, sister, other family members, and friends, I don't want them to be sad"
1642,I don’t know what to do,"I’ve been crying so hard for hours, I can’t remember the last time I’ve cried so hard I bruised myself beneath my eyes. I feel so broken and alone and there’s nothing I can do. I tried calling the hotline but got so anxious I immediately hung up. I feel like I need to go to the hospital but my mom and sister are going away this weekend for my sisters birthday and I don’t wanna ruin the trip and Christmas is so soon. I just wanna hurt myself but I don’t wanna let people down and I just can’t cope with this. I can’t do this anymore"
1643,Blood thinners?,Will these help me bleed out?
1645,I got denied yesterday,"Life fucking sucks so much. I’ve never had any sort of girlfriend, and it’s gotten to the point that I’m so awkward that I’ve basically been shut out of that forever. I probably won’t even have my first kids till I’m in my late twenties or something. And sure that happens to people, but that makes me fucking depressed, because I’m really sad and suicidal all the time, but I always have that little bit of hope for love in the back of my mind not matter how much I tell myself that it isn’t happening. Basically all I had going for me was that and my college applications. But I just got denied by my Early Decision school, and now I just feel like shit. Getting through the day, hearing people at my school talking about how they were accepted to Dartmouth, Cornell, Brown, etc. and I can’t even get into Swarthmore? And even the others who didn’t get in at least got deferred. I just got flat out denied. Am I that sad? Why have I been holding out on killing myself all this time? Is it just my fear, or is there maybe something better for me in the future?"
1646,holy shit just had an extreme manic episode,"i feel like the real me is so trapped and that sounds super corny but it’s true.

i was laughing so much and felt so high and good but i feel like i’m slowly going insane. i’m actually looking forward to my next appointment tomorrow. jesus."
1647,I did it again,"Ive been cutting myself with a paper clip all day, it fucking hurts but it doesn’t break the skin and my arms heal in a matter of days. I just can’t left you my sleeve on my left arm, it’s not that bad.
I don’t want to die, I don’t know why the fuck I’m doing this to myself, I don’t like needles I don’t like blood!
But I used a thumbtack today on my hand, it didn’t work so I used a needle. I don’t know why the fuck I’m doing this. I have a bandage on my hand now. I’m scared and trapped and alone. It’s the second post of mine, but it’s getting worse. I don’t want to die."
1648,"goodnight, my friends",i love you and i'm going. tonight i'm taking a ziptie to my neck. here is your last chance to say anything to find. I m no riddle . Just outside too long and cant find the dooknob back inside..
1649,I wonder after I dead what happens next,
1650,planning to kill myself,"im not completely sure how yet, but im going to kill myself. i have a letter written to my boyfriend, i plan to see him one last time to give it to him. there are things i am worried about after im gone, like my dog, who gets really scared and upset when he's away from me, or my little sister, she won't have me to look up to or have me to keep her secrets and cover for her when shes doing something behind my parents backs. i don't want to leave my boyfriend, and with him being suicidal as well  im afraid that he'll just follow in my footsteps.

but im just so tired of living. im so tired of the constant stress and constant anxiety, being in the best mood one second and then having to fake it the next. im tired of not being able to sleep and only having nightmares when i do. im tired of feeling completely out of place, im tired of this world, im tired of my species. 

it's like, i just want to get away, but there's literally nowhere i can go to avoid everything and actually be completely genuinely happy for once. so killing myself is my plan. i want to tell someone, like my best friend or something, that i want to kill myself. but if i do it'll become this huge deal, and i don't want to end up in a mental hospital.

im giving out my valuable items, most to my boyfriend. i have a friend who lives across the street that i made a drawing for. i haven't talked to him in months (completely different story) and i walked over today and gave it to him, even though its not finished. he said he thought id never talk to him again, and all i could think about is that that'd be the last time ever. i wanted to say something but i don't think hed understand, therefore wouldn't handle it correctly. 

my boyfriend is away right now, and has no way of contacting me. not being able to talk to him makes me feel like i have nobody to talk to, nobody to trust, nobody i can tell my feelings to. hes the only person id be able to tell that i really want to kill myself, that im thoroughly planning it out. 

i don't even know why im writing this post because i don't think anything is going to change my mind, i guess i just felt the need to get it out that im doing it. im just so done with everything. i know people say committing suicide is the most selfish and weak thing someone could do, but i don't care anymore. maybe this is all because ive been keeping mild suicidal thoughts bottled up and now because im in this really bad state of mind, its all coming out at once, but either way its made me fully realize that suicide would truly be better for everyone and everything at this point.

i don't know when my boyfriend will be back, but my plan is to kill myself the day after i get to see him. i don't know how much longer i can stay here though. 

if something happened to change, or you stumble across this after im gone, keigan, i love you, and im sorry."
1651,My ruined life,"I'm currently in college and I love where I am. But I'm gonna fail out. 
Last semester I had a rough time. I failed. Lied to my parents and they couldn't found out. They helped me get to doctors. I got my funding reinstated. 
    For a while this semester I was doing good. 
I really was. But it went down hill. I lied again. They think it's all okay. I have skipped every final. 


 I blew my chance. My life is all over. I can't face my parents knowing I lied. The hurt they will feel will be twice as worse. I just can't do this. They think I'm coming home. I'm just gonna do it. 

    It will crush them. But my life is ruined and it's my fault. My friends have gone home and I'm all alone. 
It was nice for a while I though I had hope. 

I just need to die"
1652,I’m at a loss,"It’s minus 35 degrees, and higher with wind chill. I want to sleep outside tonight, and enough pills and booze could help. I’m sick of this shit. I’m tired"
1653,Does anyone else feel this hopeless?,"Does anyone else feel the same way that I do? I am as lonely as they come. I have never felt in my life, like I fit in with anyone. Everywhere I’ve went, there’s always been someone(s) that didn’t like me. I feel like I am a bit on the ditzy side and lack competence. I’ve always had issues with my weight and have always been invisible. I’ve never had true friends, even when I attempted to put myself out there and be friendly. As a result, I am completely alone. I don’t get along with my family and live with my dog. I don’t ever get asked out my guys and when I have, they were guys that I did not find attractive. What about me is so undesirable? Why am I so hopeless? It doesn’t feel nice knowing that you’re better off dead on a daily basis, contemplating and wondering “what if”. Even after trying medication and counseling, I only end up feeling frustrated and as if I wasted my time. Anyone else relate?"
1654,How do I write a suicide note,"I’m going to do the deed soon, I just need help with writing the notes. I’m not good at goodbyes, and I don’t want my last communication with people to be sub-par, so some help would be nice"
1655,Everything I’ve done was for nothing,"It’s a really weird feeling knowing that every single thing I’ve done in my life was completely pointless. 

I just finished another semester at college and this is likely going to be my last because of how poorly I’ve done. I’m most likely going to fail out after I receive my final grades for the semester. 

I have no ambition, no drive, no motivation, no hope, no worth. Sure many people believe that there’s nothing after death and that everything we do is pointless anyway, including myself. The difference is that’s all opinion and speculation, there’s no way to actually know. This feels different. It’s like someone telling you to write a 5 page busywork essay and when you finish they take it and shred it then erase the file. You know that what you’ve just done had no purpose, you just did it because you were told to. This is what it feels like. Like everything leading up to this point was utterly worthless because none of it made any difference. 

I don’t know why I bothered posting this. Who fucking cares and I’m sorry you wasted your time reading this. Don’t feel like you need to reply and ask what’s wrong or offer me suggestions on how to improve my life, I really don’t care anymore."
1656,Genuinely over empty platitudes by people not dealing with this unending sorrow.,"It doesn’t always get better. Sometimes it feels like all there’s left for you in the world is misery. I hate people telling me to consider how everyone else will have to deal with pain if I take *my own* life when no one is checking for how much pain I’m suffering through. Deciding that I no longer want to take part in this life is as much a right as any other human right. Currently lying under my bed with a few tears nuzzled in the corners of each eye because I’m too empty emotionally to produce anything more. Wondering how many days it would take someone to find my corpse under here if I go through with it. I wouldn’t want anyone finding my body though so I’m waiting until I can find a solution to disposing of my own body simultaneously. It doesn’t always get better and in the time between now and this supposed “better” time period, a lot of us are still here in a quicksand of self-loathing and crippling emptiness."
1657,When is it a good/realistic option to pick suicide,I hate my life and am failing already even at a young age and am wondering at what point is suicide justified
1658,I can’t keep going,"Everything in my life has led to misery, I try and I try to be ok, but I never am. I think at this point it might be ethical to end it. I can’t keep doing this it’s becoming too hard to deal with. I just want my pain to stop."
1659,One of my fav poems,"It is selfish
To make someone suffering
Stay that way
Let him take his life
Let peace settle in his bones
And his heavy heart
Because suicide is not because
You dont want to live
But because you do not
Want
To
Feel
Pain"
1660,They were right,Loneliness really does kill.
1661,Ready to just end it all,No one can help me and that really hurts. I’m in an abusive household and the only way out seems suicide
1662,I want to die but my anti psychotic meds are making it tough,"I’m on Olanzapine depot injections. My brain hurts. But worse than my brain is my heart which is black from all the things I’ve watched on the Internet. I can hear neighbours yelling things at me. I’d die just to give them peace at this point. Suicide is difficult I don’t know how people do it, maybe it’s just my meds making it harder for me to make the final decision."
1664,"Every day is just a little bit worse, and every day I make the world a little bit worse","I bring nothing to the world, I just use up resources that someone smarter or kinder than me deserves. I’m a burden on my loved ones and they deserve better. My coworkers only tolerate me because I’m the only one trained for my specific job. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore, and all of my hobbies feel like a chore. I’ve tried new hobbies but when they inevitably bore me or stress me out, then I feel guilty for wasting money and time. 

Every day I just feel a little more tired and a little more burned out. And every day I feel anxious and panicked about wasting what could be my last tolerable day. I’m scared that one day I’ll wake up and that last little bit of hope I have will be gone, too."
1665,Tonight my boyfriend fell asleep with his head in my lap. Tomorrow he's going to wake up to find me gone. I'm freaking out.,"I don't know how to feel. I love him so much but I can't do this anymore. It's happening tonight and I've been relieved since I decided that, but all the sudden I'm panicking."
1666,Helping a friend - or trying to,"I have a friend who is really struggling to believe that ""everything is going to be ok"".

He's autistic, and desperately sad, and I'm terrified that he's going to hurt himself.   
I mentioned that I feel helpless to help him, and suggested that I conference in a hotline, and he freaked out. Seems the 1st time he tried calling a hotline, he ended up in handcuffs and forcefully admitted to a hospital. The next time he tried, the same thing happened.   
I'm on the phone with him now. I'm trying to convince him that tomorrow could be better, but the large issues he is dealing with are not easily resolved. 

He keeps telling me he doesn't feel good. His back hurts, but his emotions are hurting every bit as much - or more - than his back."
1667,What does love feel like?,"What does it feel like to love someone or someone love you back. I’m just all alone in this shitty thing and no sign of it getting better. 

One day I will make the leap and do it but for now I just cry myself to sleep."
1668,Just Needed A Spot For Vulnerability,"I'm 27m, and process suicidal ideation daily.

I've placed myself into a cycle where I have left no place to be weak. Not weakness in a negative sense. Healthy, vulnerable weakness.

I act as the confidante and advisor to the people I know. Once they've begun on a healthy path of overcoming their woe, (eg. alcoholism, obesity, bpd) through working with me to develop strategies, obtain resources, and create motivations, they cease communicating with me.

I'm perpetually the organizer, planner, and initiator of all my time spent with friends, on both an individual and group basis. If I don't reach out, I simply will never hear from them again.

Yet in both these scenarios I am receiving praise, gratitude, and insistence of more time being spent with one another. In no way is their desire to end the time spent communicated, which leaves me at a loss as to why the time is lost.

I don't have a family, so the obligation of blood relations is not an explorable option.

As a teacher and leader in my communities, I've created a presence that peers come to rely on, but have expressed discomfort in being relied on.

My counsellor has been helpful in helping me develop coping and processing skills, but there is still that distinction between an equal relationship with a friend and a paid professional service.

I'm candid and transparent about my past with all the friends that have inquired. I was molested and beaten for ten years, attempted suicide thrice, found the bodies of two of my friends post suicide, and watched another die in hospital post car crash. This developed a, likely related, PTSD, depression and anxiety.

This isolation in a crowd feeling has gradually led me further down the hole of another attempt at suicide.

I've accomplished my goals. I've saved lives, forgiven my abusers, and successfully created and supported communities that actively rescue and help youth, queer, and aboriginal groups at risk.

It feels like I've done enough for redemption and to leave a net positive. I'm exhausted now. I've achieved my self-actualization of being an average human.

I feel desired until I've strengthened the vulnerable and they, now strong, leave. I don't help with the expectation of reciprocation.

All these things I've done feel hollow, empty.

I don't want to be strong anymore. I just want permission to be weak.

Thank you for listening, faceless ether of peers."
1669,Wish someone would kill me,"I truly wish to die. I have struggled for a long time now, and am sure my girlfriend is the only reason I don't kill myself. I wish I could end my relationship and then kill myself, but I don't know how to do it in a way that doesn't make her life much harder. She tries very hard to make me happy and doesn't deserve any of it. I am, of course, a black hole. I take in all the privilege and fortune I come across and have nothing to show for it. I have come to terms with the fact that I am extrordinarily disappointing for a variety of reasons.

Of course as time goes on I suspect I'll eventually do it regardless. Which on top of everything else that I am unsuccessful at will add on the fact that I will be an unsympathetic, selfish, nonhuman being.

I didn't ask to be born, but I certainly didn't do right as I lived. For fairness sake, I didn't get a good start in many ways. But I still misused what I was even given, making me worse than garbage."
1670,my time is almost up,"well, its finally time. the beginning of the end. happiness isnt real. love isnt real. family isnt loyal. friends arent real. sobriety really is a curse huh. im killing myself on christmas. goodbye abuse!!:)"
1671,Today I finally realized how fucked I am.,"Just came back from an afterparty. Here's everything I did wrong and what I noticed other people do.

1) Upon arriving I was greeted with ""ooh... it's X_Ix3..."" and let me tell you something - I knew I wasn't going to enjoy myself at that moment because it was a clear hint that I'm a boring fuck.

2) I took a close look at all the people who were there. I saw some acquaintances and instead of greeting them I walked past 'em to take a seat. Jesus Christ, what a fucking pussy LMAO.

3) I did alright during 1 on 1 conversations but group chats were horrendous. I wasn't really in the talking circle, instead people came in front of me like I wasn't even there. When they told stories I was THE ONLY ONE who they didn't make eye contact with. That already says a lot.

4) I couldn't join in or add something to the conversations since I have 0 knowledge on how to fucking socialize. I just stared at those folks speaking and did my awkward laugh at times when they were telling jokes. Man, I must have looked like a legitimate moron.

5) I was finally done humiliating myself and decided to leave after doing nothing for AN HOUR. I fistbumped 2 guys and bounced. One of them told me to come back but I said I'll go for a drive instead.

6) Here I am writing this pathetic post in my car. Going to head inside and probably cry, hopefully no one will notice. I want to kill myself so badly but I just can't seem to find the last straw to finally push me there. Ah, maybe one day."
1672,One day,"I guess I’ve been suicidal for about 5 years. Not the whole time but it’s always there. It just gets to the point were nothing can stop me it just fucking consumes me for then goes away for awhile. I’ve tried counseling and depression and anxiety meds didn’t feel anything but side affects and didn’t like counseling. I know, I know try more but I’m fucking sick of trying. Put me on a waiting list for 3 months and I’m gunna talk myself out of that appointment what good has any other appointment done for me? 


I recently went back to college. I had a lot of shit luck this summer and was broke so I’ve had to ask my parents for a lot of money in addition to what they’ve already done for me. And I’m still too broke to pay for food and other expenses because I spend it on weed and alcohol. I honestly hate myself for it. I’m spending my parents hard earned money on an eighth that’ll make me feel good for 3 days? I’m tired of being a fucking drain on them. I’m tired of fucking up. I’m just tired man. I don’t want help I’ve had enough of that. I just want it to stop. I don’t think I’m built for this. Some people are just weak and there’s really only one way out."
1673,"Thinking about buying a gun with my paycheck next Friday, using it the day I get it to finally stop suffering",
1674,Fucking bored of my life,"It's so uneventful and worthless, I hate it"
1675,Someone please help,"I’ve been thinking about it a lot today. I picked up the gun but didn’t want to do it. I broke some glass on purpose to cut an artery and make it look accidental. I am failing my class, I can’t fucking walk because of surgery. My life is shit right now. I don’t want to kms but at the same time I want to be dead."
1676,ayyyeee,"so hello there! haha well, i'm planning to kill myself on the early hours of january 11th.   


the reason for the delay is because it's my mom's birthday on the new year's eve.  
i would most likely have executed the act earlier if not for the circumstance.  
speaking of circumstances !!  reasons for this self-inflicted death would be 

  
\- pre-determinism 

\- nihilism (optimistic)

\- frivolous evaluation in contrast to the cosmic calendar  
\- the unknowns of the universe and our (most probable) lack of capacity to comprehend such

&amp;#x200B;

could be summed up with "" unorthodox beliefs""   
yeahhh uhhh so haha 

&amp;#x200B;

anyone to talk with?? out there?"
1677,I never seriously considered suicide until now.,"Hey, so, let me tell you my sad story. Basically, I'm a pathetic 23-year-old virgin who still lives with his mom. I want to go out, I want to be an adult, I want to be a man. But I'm not. I'm just a pathetic loser who's meant to stay here and just watch while everyone in life around me is getting jobs, careers, relationships, finding love, having the life I always wanted while I just sit here and rot. These feelings have been swelling in me for a long time. The catalyst was that I was stupid enough to ever think that me and my friend that I loved (who I was ""intimate"" with in the past) revealed that she now has a boyfriend. An actual man. A man with a job and who doesn't live with his mom. It's my fault for ever thinking someone so weak and pathetic and bottom of the food chain as me could ever have a girl like her. I'm just tired of going on living if this is what life is. I'm tired of the hurt, the feelings of worthlessness, everyone around me moving when I'm just staying still. I actually looked up some methods, but I can't find one that works for me. I thought about chugging some pain killers but I don't think that will do anything. Honestly, if I had a gun, I might just go through with it. Quick and painless."
1678,It feels inevitable that I'll do it since I have no hope. So shouldn't I just get it over with?,"I dont think I can last 60 more years. I am so unhappy, hating myself and going no where. I am hopeless and tired. I dont enjoy life, i have no goals anymore. I just want it over. I dont want to hurt myself and suicide is very scary to do. But honestly maybe i need to suck it up and just do it"
1679,This is the weekend,I’m going to the store tomorrow morning when it opens at 10am and buying a shotgun. I know I don’t need a permit to buy one. I’m going to suck down to the barrel and blow my fucking brains out. Im going to do it in my apartment. I’m sorry to whoever has to come clean it up afterwards.
1680,I don't want to be alone,"I'm sick and tired of being alone. I'm fed up with being used and abused by others, and that either people want to change me, want me to change, or simply just treat me as a tool... and these people are my ""friends"", my ""family"". And I didn't even talk about all those people who don't even treat me like a human being. All I wanted in this life is to be able to love someone, who doesn't kick me. But I guess it's my fault for being born this way. And I really want to die, because at this point I'm pretty sure I shouldn't ever dream about a relationship or even friends to begin with. And don't tell me ""this'll get better soon"", because it won't be. It was the same in my entire life.

And whenever I try to meet someone and think things will change, they either won't or I'm getting used once again. Because if it is this hard to find decent people, I'd rather than just die. It'd still be better than living my entire life all alone."
1681,I've never wanted to kill myself more than I do tonight,I'm just sitting in my car after work. Just got done cutting up my leg. But the pain in my leg pales in comparison to the pain I feel inside myself. All I can do right now is think about how nice it would be to cut myself even deeper and just bleed out and die so I can get away from life. Just the idea of living another day makes my stomach turn. I want out. I can't take this anymore
1682,What has your counseling experience been?,"If you go to a therapist or counselor, what has your experience been? How do they handle difficult things with you"
1683,nothing interesting to find here,"This is my first post so I don't really know how to write this but yeah

I don't know what to do anymore. I just had a phase of getting better and just overall really wanting to get better. Set myself some goals and kept working on them everyday. But today was the worst day in a long time and why should I even keep trying if this is the reward? I literally have one friend that I see once a week. I am socially awkward af and always get ignored. Everytime I try to contribute something to a conversation, other people act like I'm not even there. Probably my own fault like everything else. I once tried building up a social life but couldn't stand it, it was just so exhausting, and still, I crave doing stuff friends do together.

I had a ed a while ago, a few months now, and I can't stop thinking about how good I felt back then. I actually know that I was miserable but I liked it. Feeling my stomach hurting constantly, sometimes almost breaking down because I felt so weak and exhausted.

I don't really know why I'm writing this. I don't know how to discribe what I'm feeling. I visit this sub every few days, mostly when I'm feeling worse than I normally do. Currently, I just feel helpless. I live right besides train tracks and really want to end it that way.

Sry if I made some mistakes, English isn't my mother tongue. And sorry that almost every sentence starts with ""I"".

Have a lovely morning/afternoon/evening/night."
1684,i just want some attention,"I'm one point away from getting an A and the professor won't round my grade. I feel very sad, feel like i don't have a future, feel like i'll never be important to someone. I lost everything when my grades went down. i feel sad i know nothing will help but my brain feels like its burning and i just want someone to pay attention to me. i still have work to do for school but none of it feels worthwhile anymore i just want to die. please"
1685,I don’t want to live,"Everything I’ve done to get help has driven me closer to the brink.
I don’t know what to do"
1686,my grades,"And don't tell me I'm worth more than my grades or anything like that. This is my place of self-worth.

My grades are falling. I'm going to get a B in one class and I missed it by one point. If I had .38% more I would have gotten an A. Normally when I get suicidal, I get very emotional and have the shut down effect where I just lay in bed and don't do anything and it passes when I wake up. This time I feel a lot more serious about it because I truly see no future. I'm not going to make it in academia. I got low grades in important classes. I don't know how to do research. I haven't applied to graduate school. I don't have enough letters of recommendation or the simple level-headedness to get me through. There is just so much pressure that I'd rather give up.  Even if I did do well, it's impossible to get a tenure-track job because the job market is horrible. The path from undergrad to assistant professor is  pure anxiety. I know I won't enjoy it and I won't be myself. I just want to do research and make contributions but I can't because I'm stupid and lazy and my GPA is ruined and I'm too self-loathing and helpless to pick up the pieces. 

I don't know what to do now. I'm thinking about going with helium because I want it to be super painless. Or maybe jumping off a bridge (just as long as I don't drown). I don't know when to do it. Should I do it over winter break? Does anyone know how schools react? I hate the mental health obsession out here (which doesn't help because the counselors suck) and I don't want the school to jump on my case. Should I do it after I graduate (next semester)? There's nothing out there for me. I have no interest outside of science and no value besides being a good nerd. I lost my value. I just want to go. It hurts to walk around all slow, always fatigued, alone, my heart hurts. I'm so devastated and hopeless. I don't even want to try to try. I don't want to confront how painful the mark is on my transcript. Every time I feel hopeful, I feel a surge of anxiety. It's just better to give up because I can't tolerate any of this. I have a bad brain."
1687,I want to die,I want to walk to the nearest bridge and jump off of it. I want to stick a knife in a electric socket and stop my heart. I want to take all the pills I can get and destroy my organs. I want to slit my wrists wide open and watch the blood run down my fingers. I want to hang myself off of the tree in my backyard like a swing. I want to fall to my demise and watch as my body splatters against the cement in a desperate attempt to stop existing. All I need to do now is act on it and them I'm free. It's just that simple.
1688,Uninteresting,"No cares about me, no one wants to hang out with me, no one considers me attractive, no one worries about me, no one is nice to me.  
  
I am a worthless, pathetic person and I don't wanna live in a world I am not wanted."
1689,I'm Almost Done,"Honestly? So much shit has been happening w my sister that I no longer have the desire to actually enjoy being home. 
My sister has been on and off drugs for the past three years and she's starting to use yet again. I want to cut and I want to see blood but yet again I'm so fucking scared."
1690,Therapist told me to go to call a hotline or 911,"I emailed him yesterday. Today he responded and said he’s leaving for the weekend and busy till our next appointment next week. And he wonders why I don’t trust him... I’m absolutely sure he wishes I’d die so he won’t need to see me anymore. Despite my confronting him about it AND his denial. 

So Merry Christmas, therapist, I’ll be gone before New Year."
1691,"With Christmas quickly approaching, just want to shout out all the John and Jane Doe’s, it is truly a miserable life with no money no family no friends and just pain. I know all too well. Just know that you aren’t alone.",All I know is complete pain and misery. All I do is just look for hookups and casual flings to feel absolutely anything.  Of course I never even sniff success.  I would end it all if I had a surefire way and had no worries about a botch.  To everyone who knows truly nothing but agony and misery. Just know you are not alone in your suffering.
1692,I’m going to kill myself on January 6th,"Don’t try to talk me out of it because I’ve decided. I’ve decided that life isn’t worth living, I’m a failure and I just want it all to end. Death is peaceful, death is relaxing and I’m ready to experience it. I’ve already come up with a plan: I’m going to overdose on Midol. It’s perfect, people won’t know I killed my self they’ll just assume that I’m stupid and if it doesn’t work I’ll just pretend that it was an accident. January 6th is perfect because it’s far enough from the holidays to the point where my family won’t associate my death with Christmas but it’s close enough to the point where I won’t have to deal with life anymore. That’s all, I want to thank everyone on the page for always being so kind. See you on the other side, goodbye."
1693,Another kissless Virgin Incel contemplating suicide 24 years old I cannot take it anymore,"You can blame blackpill all you want but guess what? I was pretty blackpilled since young age, I just didn't know it. And what did I do?

I numbed all those feeling man, I started playing video games like a madman and for a long time it made me happy but now I am sick and tired of it, I want to live in the real world but with the knowledge of the blackpill it is pointless. 

At this point for me to improve my situation I need surgeries and steroids, nothing else is gonna give me the will and confidence to be social and be a normal member of society and before you roll your eyes I have 3 BIG ISSUES right now, an deep overbite aka maloclusion class 2, low testosterone levels (ence why i talked about steroids but i shouldve had said TRT) and acne.

But folks the damage has been done, I missed on teenage love, I have never felt what it was like for a girl to be in love with me and also my family
is disfuntional, living with my single mother and raised without a father figure.

Folks at this point I have no reason to live, my daily routine consists in going to the gym or going to the mall or supermarket, I am narcissist and some days I wake up thinking that I am an Chad but the reality hits me everytime I go out and NO WOMEN show interest or looks at me.

While I may be above average in looks they are not good enough and thus my mind is shattered."
1694,Birthday,"My 14th birthday is in a month, im kinda exited too see if i make it alive till then"
1695,One more Christmas,"I don’t see myself being around for the Christmas of 2020.. so for this one I’m going to smile, and I’m going to laugh, I’m going to look around into my families eyes and enjoy this Christmas.. ✌🏻"
1696,Ready to take all of my psychotics in the bottle and I hope at the very least I slip into a deep coma,"Or I die. It doesn’t matter as long as I’m not aware of anything happening. As long as I can leave. Yesterday during my eye check up, I hoped I had something that would make me go blind. At my doctors appointment, I prayed to god that something was wrong with my body, I had a disease, something. Anything that means I wouldn’t have to be here. I just want to die. And I’m ready to go ahead and do whatever it takes to do so. My mom doesn’t think I’ll do it well we’ll see what happens. She’s such a fucking bitch. I hate her for screwing my life up, I hate her I hate her. And I hate living, I hate being stuck with her. I wish I could be talked out of it but I don’t even know anymore, I just want someone to care."
1697,Guess who's back?,Honestly I expected to be back here but not so late. Well I'm back and worse then ever hooray! Ok I'll start now: I'm more depressed then last time and I've completely lost my emotions. My father still calls me a lazy fat slob though I do everything in the house I've started cutting and feel like ending my life every second of the day. I'm trying not to for my brothers and sister but I can't for much longer. That is all I have to say for now....
1698,I constantly feel like I’m not enough.,"I have nowhere else to go. I feel like I have no friends left. Over the past year, I’ve drifted from all my friends. I feel like it’s my fault. I’m not pushing them away, they just don’t like me and don’t want to be friends with me. I’m not good enough for them, I’m not nice enough, I’m not smart enough, not funny enough, not athletic enough, not pretty enough, not skinny enough, not talented enough. I’m too awkward, too crass, too insecure, I don’t belong. I feel like I’m not good enough for my parents. They say that I’m fine as I am but I know they want me to be better.

About five years ago, my friend told me her birthday. Then we didn’t see each other for a few years. Last year, after I asked about the date and she said that had been a lie. It was actually a different day. I accepted it and moved on. Today I found out that the date I had originally remembered was true. I heard from another friend that she lied about the date because no one remembered her birthday. I remembered her birthday for four years and my then best friend still didn’t trust me or like me enough to tell me her birthday. She was comfortable lying to my face for a full year. Instead of telling me, she told my other friend, someone she doesn’t like and regularly calls annoying. Then she lied about the reason. I remembered her birthday, but she still lied to me so her reason is obviously untrue. 

Thats not the only part. The friend she told only told me after I got upset. He said he’d known for a month, but didn’t want to betray her trust. I’ve been close with him for over a year. He used to like my other “friend” even though she thought he was annoying. Later, one of his friends  told him that me ”friend” was being really toxic toward him and manipulative (which in some ways she was). Even after believing her to be this toxic person, he still valued her feelings over mine. I thought we were closer than that. But apparently, a year of being there for him, giving him advice, helping him, and comforting wasn’t enough. He’ll always care about her more than he cares about me.

In the span of about five minutes, I found out that both my closest friends weren’t as good to me as I thought they were. I feel so alone. I hate this. I hate this so much. I don’t know what to do. I have no one to talk to. Im too scared to confront them. I hate my life. No matter what I do, I’m not good enough for anyone to care about me, at least any more than people they adamantly dislike."
1699,It's been a week since my suicidal thought came back,"I don't know what to think and how to deal with it. Until last week everything was right but I just want to kill myself. 
I managed to improve myself a lot but now it's feel like I did nothing. Obviously I know the root: my family and my bad grades. 
No matter how I interact with them I just hate myself at the end and feel more depressed. Obviously I live with them so It can't help. Then I try to work hard in college but no matter what I do, my grades are still shitty. My family will try to manipulate every aspect of my life that they can witness. So without graduation i can't escape them. And it's taking me so long. 
I try to stay more confident but seriously, it's too hard. I don't even know what beinf  confident mean. All I have is fake perception.
I try to figure out a solution but my patience is at its limit. I can't fight anymore."
1700,I attempted last night and it failed,"I tried overdosing but it didn’t work. I want to do it again but I’ve run out. I don’t want help, I just want to go.

Please someone harm me to the point where my guts are spilling everywhere :)"
1701,I had an amazing month and then today reminded me that I will never escape from my problems,"The past month I have done well in school, felt like a new person and on top of the world. I am meeting my goals, one tiny step at a time. 

My relationship started getting better. It was feeling amazing. He even suggested we buy rings together. 

Until tonight, when a fight with my boyfriend had reminded me that I will always be a sick, disturbed, piece of shit idiot. I get consumed with rage and now my throat is raw from screaming. Not even words, just primal screaming. I will never be able to change. And I really do try. It just isn't good enough. 

Every time I think I have changed, been reborn, every time I see myself growing and becoming better, it's squashed by the reality that I am a disturbed individual. 

He wants to move out now.

We were supposed to have fun, just the two of us, with our family being out of the house for the weekend. This is the only time we've ever been alone together in the house. 

But tonight was the first fight we had in a while and he ran away from the house. He took my car. I let him, but now I'm stuck alone in the house. 

My success in my academic life is nothing compared to how much I want success in my relationship.

I am tired. Being a good person is hard. Being there for my friends all the time is hard. Being a Dean's List student is hard. I don't want to put in this work when I get nothing of substance in return."
1702,What's the point of holding on?,"It's the same shit all over again and again. Every day spent being too numb to feel anything. Every night spent drinking and feeling too much and crying.


I've been stuck for too long. Any progress I make I end up messing up anyway. Been in this rut for many years. I may get better for a little while, but I end up in the rut every time. Mom is always bitching about it, saying how I'm not doing anything to help myself. I did try, for a while. She took away the one thing that was helping. And now, I suppose, she's right. I've stopped trying. All I do is drink and feel sorry for myself.


All everyone says is that I shouldn't kill myself because of how the people around me would feel. But I'm so sick of that. I've stopped caring about that.  Why should their emotions matter? Why should I suffer just so they don't have to be ~sad~ that I'm gone?


The one light I had in my life is rotting away six feet under. With him, things were always manageable, almost happy. Without him, things are like before, only worse. And today marks exactly one month since he killed himself.


There really is no point to anything anymore.


I just need to get shitfaced enough to finally have the courage to off myself. Shouldn't be too hard."
1703,I am just so tired.,"I feel like I have no strenght left. 
I don't know why I am typing this. 
I am so ashamed of being such a sad person.
My life seems like a long wait for the end."
1704,I don’t know how to not hate myself,I cannot think of one positive aspect of myself and I hate how much it makes me feel so drained. I’m terrified of having the few friends I’ve got leave me alone for good. I can’t do that. I honestly don’t see myself living past 30 if it means dying alone. I’m so scared
1705,losing it a little bit more recently,"i feel stuck. i’m in a beautiful, loving relationship. i’ve been suffering from some sort of chronic psychosis and BPD for as long as i can remember. which makes it very difficult for me to keep afloat in such a high intensity relationship. i adore my girlfriend more than anything. we’ve been through so many hardships together and stuck by each other and no one’s ever loved me or cared for me like she has. she never ceases to remind me how valued i am, or how i deserve a place on this planet. 
recently, i’ve been dipping in and out of probably my biggest breakdown. it just keeps going. it never ends. every week i’m winding up in at least three moments of crisis. my psychosis is off the fucking chart and everything is so lucid and fleeting. 
my girlfriend has been through a very similar thing to me. she’s currently getting help and she’s doing so well. sober and stable. and i couldn’t be prouder. 
at the moment, i’m finding it so hard to communicate how difficult everything is for me. both of us have come to realise, i’m really really ill. and she can’t deal with me having another breakdown. which hurts me so much. i understand it, but it burns. so i’ve been finding it hard to come clean about how suicidal i am. she knows i’m struggling a lot, and is helping me get help. and god fucking knows i want to happy and healthy and stable and enjoying existence with the love of my life more than anything. but i’m scared of jeopardising the best thing that’s ever happened to me. she’s stuck through by me consistently, and vice versa. 
i’m really isolated at the moment. and things are a big tense because of how depressed i am right now. i feel like i cant tell her when i’m having a bad day because she spirals and thinks i’m going to hurt myself, which leads her to think it’s all her fault or something. and we’ve talked about how this isn’t true, and that she naturally panics, but i despise myself for ever even letting her believe this. and i despise myself for hurting her by being so ill. i swear i’m trying to get better. i am. i really am. i’m talking to therapists. i’m following up medication. i’m sober. i haven’t attempted to kill myself in a while. i’m really fucking trying. but my heart breaks a little bit more everyday. i’m so devastatingly scared she’s going to leave me if i even present slightly worse. so i’ve been isolating myself. to be honest, this pressure of trying to be better so that she doesn’t fall apart is making me more depressed than whatever has triggered this breakdown and it’s soul crushing. i adore her. i know we can get through this. and we will. but i’m scared. i’m very insecure. and i’d somehow rather kill myself before it reaches the point where she’s considering letting me go because it hurts her to see me like this. it’s so heart breaking. i want to kill myself because of it. i just want to be better though. i want to be alive with her and healthy and happy for her. why cant i get better? why am i so ill? i just want to make her happy"
1706,I need help,Do you ever feel like you’re just a background character? Or that you’ll just always be that one person in someone’s life that killed themself? I keep zoning out thinking of how I could end my life and tell people. I kind of find comfort in that I could just end it all and be fine. I keep getting really scared of my brain and I listen to music a lot so that I don’t have to be alone with my thoughts.
1707,My experimenting with gay sex makes me wanna kill myself,"Fuck my porn addiction. I hate my life, I snapped out of it as soon as both times were done but I have nothing but regret. I just wanna kill my self cuz I loved women all my life and feel like I betrayed them."
1708,Should I kill myself?,That's it. Nothing else. I've had a horrible life so far and dont want to continue. What's the point?
1709,What's the point of holding on?,"It's the same shit all over again and again. Every day spent being too numb to feel anything. Every night spent drinking and feeling too much and crying.

1711,Attempted suicide a few days ago but made myself sick. I keep wanting to try again,"So a few nights ago I tried to kill myself by taking a load of sertraline pills. After taking a packet, I lay in bed for a minute or so then made myself sick.
I'm having feelings like I'm a coward and just want to have the push to just end things.

I was at my Christmas party tonight. My ex was there. She wore the dress that she knew I always wanted to see her wear. Got her hair cut just how I like it and she didnt say a word to me.
The pain I'm feeling emotionally is unbearable. How the fuck do i get past these feelings. I dont want to mutilate myself, or jump in front of a train because I want to not look a mess. I just want to drift off and never wake up."

Its takwn me 10 years and a lot of blood sweat and tears to get it. I got this place to make sure me and my daughter were no longer living around my violent mother.

Anyone, someone, please, help me. My daughter is autistic. I have literally 7 dollars to my name, until Wednesday. If anyone woukd please be kind enough to let me borrow at least $100 for a few nights stay in a hotel, so we don't have to sleep in my car(its 18 degrees outside), and to be abke to get her prescriptions, you will literally be saving us both. .

I worked so hard to get away from her grandmother. I put it all on the line, and this happened. Sorry for the typos, I can't quit crying. Please, someone. I'm begging anyone."
1715,Anyone else just feel like a broken toy for good,"Used and abused by everyone else for their own ends never really going for your own or giving up on them then but still going through finding happiness in weird places and small things and then eventually someone you let play with you plays a little to hard and breaks you for good this time and you don't really come back for it 



It hasn't even been 24 hours yet but this time it's so different from everything else and every other time that I can't help but to think this is it. Whatever time I got left around here it's gonna be in this emptiness just broken for good, hurt and completely discarded one too many times 



3 years ago my own gf killed herself and it still didn't feel as hopeless as it does right now didn't feel like ""what's the point anyway"" as it does now so I suppose it's all accumulated into this not a single moment but a series of them and then one too many too hard by the wrong person."
1716,To continue living as a failure or die with a promising image of what might have been...,
1717,i want someone to stop me,"i’m writing my goodbye letters. i have my night planned out. i’m prepared to let go finally, but i still wish someone would stop me. i wish my boyfriend would read my last text, but he won’t. i told him my plan, but he doesn’t care i guess. i’m so ashamed to have thought someone might care. maybe this is how my life is supposed to end, no one in sight and no one thinking about me. why can’t someone show up and stop me and tell me i’m loved?"
1718,"Everyone I cared for has left my life, and I just want someone to talk to","I don’t even know what I’m hoping to get out of this, I just want to be noticed. 

What’s the point in going in when everyone around you seems to glance over your without a second look?

I spend most of my day alone with no one to talk to, I’m starting to think “what’s the point”..."
1719,"Life is always empty to me, it's always a void to me and I hate every single day.","Parents emotionally deserted me since I was a baby and I have extreme traumatic memories starting that early. They basically only kept me alive and abused the shit out of me all my life. Sometimes I get narcissistic tendencies as a coping mechanism and I'm always dissociated and disconnected. I have no sense of self and it's always empty to me. Everything I do is empty and I'm not IN life. I'm not a part of it and have no attachment to anything. I just see a meaningless dead picture and everything is empty and futile.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Had existential depression since 5th grade. I'm introverted, full of pride, have resilience bordering on masoschism, intense, sensitive, independent, kinda gifted, eccentric and people give absolutely no fcks. They said it's empty behind my eyes. Another said there had to be something psychological about me. Another knew I was damaged. One comment was my facial expressions never changed and another said it seemed fake. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody even initiates or talks to me in college even if I look happy and open. They go to their friends and talk about clothing or trivial details as if they're a big deal. Invisible as sht.

 

Every single day is empty and dead to me. I have no connection, attachment or care about anything. But I'm sick of this extreme neglect. I want to love someone. Someone who will actually know who I am, what I lived, all these traits I listed and actually find me interesting. Everyone and everything I lost, things I will never get to experience, are all in my heart constantly. Always in pain.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never felt the emotion of security, never seen genuine care or love and I've been told I was handsome and at least above average. I only attract attention seekers and sometimes random looks. I'm not at good height for women. Maybe it's because I had to eat popcorn for breakfast at 13 after parents divorced lol. I'm the invisible guy in class who's just reading sht on his phone and pretending he's not always in pain. Welcome to my pity party as everyone calls it the moment I talk about anything about myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything left for me? I'm very well worn, always feel world weary and sick of living. Could anyone even love the person I tried to describe here? I'm not truly suicidal right now, but getting close to it, even without depression. I can feel it's getting to be a logical choice rather than due to pain or desperation. Like, it's still a good idea even if I was really happy. I really need to hear someone's reflection on all of this."
1720,Help with my suicide note,"Hello all. For a bit of context, I absolutely hate my life. I don't understand reality, and it continues to get worse. It seems that good things in my life get torn away from me without any explanation ( my younger brother / best friend dying of brain cancer, and now my wife just left me without much of a reason why). I've recently found clarity in all of this and it all leads to the answer of taking that leap. Any way I'm not the best writer, and somewhat dyslexic. I was hoping that you could help me with my suicide note, wordage, grammar, sentence structure etc. I just don't want to come off as stupid. I feel stupid too often and would like some of my last words be meaningful. any help you can provide would be great. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

To you all,

I am sorry to have put you through so much hurt because of my actions. Loss hurts. It hurts deep, and hurts big. I hope with the passage of time you will come to find comfort in knowing that now I can truly go home. I can finally and truly be happy.

All of my life I have had to endure the pain of this reality. It has rarely made sense to me, it worsens over time, and the rare occasion of finding peace or some semblance of sense get ripped away as if I were being tricked. The most sense I have found is that life has been leading me to this point. I am supposed to do this.

I have never known fate until this point and now it is so clear to me. I can fallow my life, every path I've walked, ever encounter I've had. It's all a story of being guided to take this leap. I see it as beautiful. A beautiful story. I don't see it as an end anymore, it's my prelude, or maybe it's a short story in the bigger picture, or maybe I wasn't suppose to be here in the first place and this is the world correcting itself. Either way it is beautiful, and this is how it must go.

Please know that I truly love you all. You are remarkable people and knowing you and being in your lives as well as you being in mine has been one of the best experiences I'v ever known. People are all so bizarre and funny. Your wants and desires can be so wonderful, terrible, calming, maddening, and so on. It's all so confusing most of the time but it's all beautiful either way. You are beautiful. You art art.

I ask, even beg you, that you do not follow me. You are too important to the bigger picture, you are too important to those that love you, and you are too important to me. If you care about or have ever felt any love for me then please do not follow me. Instead find love, because it is the best thing there is. Never prevent any opportunity for love, and hold the love that you have close and dear to you, because it is the most precious. This is why I am taking your love with me on my journey to the next. It will be my guiding force in what ever lies next. It is also the most valuable thing I can leave you. Hold my love dear and close to you, and remember it in dire times because then I'll be right there with you. Always.

Goodbye

Love,

My Name"
1721,Iam a failure,"So, iam from a foreing country, sorry about my grammar.  
  
I have been diagnosed with severe depression since i was 21, i struggle with it ever since (and even before that). To make things worse iam unemployed for 6 years now, making ends meet with less than 10 dollars a month, luckily i live with my parents and iam not homeless yet.  
I cant find a job because iam ""not experienced enough"" (prior to this whole situation i have worked hard since i was 14, plenty of recommendations on my resume but i never worked in the same place for more than 2 years), now my father is also unemployed and the only ones bringing something to the house is my mother and my brother. I cant even afford my medication without struggling to pay for it the next month.  
  
I have a girlfriend for 2 years now, and i honestly cant understand why she is still here. University is taking all my energy, i walk day and night looking for a job, still... Nothing.  
All i can think is how to end this miserable life, or to waste it away going for crime and drug dealing. I cant afford to go out and have a beer with my friends, my GF has to pay for everything when she invites me out.  
  
I dont feel like a man at all. What are we supposed to do? All i can think is suicide. My parents cant afford to have a dead weight sucking all they have while giving nothing in return.  
  
Iam a failure, and i think i had enough."
1722,Virgin whore,"The only thing keeping me alive is the temporary thrill of posting nudes, getting attention from older men, realize what I'm doing, delete everything, feel disgusted with myself, get bored and do it all over again."
1723,Support is hard to find,"After going through 5 psychologists, who were not willing to deal with me - they just kept sending me to someone 'more qualified' - I finally decided to talk to my boyfriend about my suicidal thoughts and plans. All he said, in a sarcastic tone was: ""Well, Sorry I can't make you happy then, even though I do so much for you..."". He fucking made it all about himself, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? 

I am struggling with alcohol problems for a while now 'to cope with the pain' of wanting to die on daily basis, when I'm drunk I feel more and more suicidal but I also hurt myself trying to hang or trying to stab myself to death. Tbh I am drunk right now while I am writing this.  
In an older post I mentioned buying 'chinese suicide pills' off the internet, They are sitting in a drawer in my bedroom. One day I am going to get drunk enough and have the courage to take them and finally end all this fucking nightmare that is my life.   


I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT."
1724,"I don't want to commit suicide, but it's almost all I think about.","Okay, ""want"" is the wrong word. ""Can't"" fits better.

I *can't* kill myself because of what it would do to my family, how it would tear everything apart. I can't do that to them. 

I need help. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I want to get better, I want to go back to how it used to be. I  just can't do this anymore.

Please please someone help me. I can't keep feeling like this."
1725,Mom died lost everything that kept me alive,My mom passed away this October out of nowhere. I was always suicidal but I was able to contain my self for her. With her gone every day just gets worse and worse. I don’t know what to do don’t even know why I’m writing on here.
1726,STAHM,"Still alive, told my fiance I wrote goodbye letters. He was disappointed, he just cant see through the depression lens, feel like I disappoint him daily. He knows my full potential, and here I am living my life like a vegetable. Fuck mental illness."
1727,Book recommendations on how to be comfortable being alone/not feeling lonely all the time.,
1728,i just want to end it all but i cant,theres one person i love so much and i just cant leave him alone after so much he did for me. hes literally the only person that cares about me. and even if i cant feel that he loves me i still love him. and if i leave him hell probably kill himself too. i just dont know what to do. i dont want help but i cant handle this myself and i just want everything to magicaly fix itself. im too tired to even cry and i just want to fucking dissapear
1729,I Don't Know What to Do Anymore,"I'm an insufferable asshole. I love my boyfriend but I don't know how to show it and he thinks I don't. My family thinks I'm lazy and I just lie to get out of things. Whenever I try to be happy it never works out. Meds don't do shit, but I still take them. I've been in therapy for like 6 years and things have just gotten worse."
1730,Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there,"Why are people praising extremism so much these days? 
I hate this fucking era of red or blue thinking... Why can't we be green?

I've just got shaddow banned by youtube, for trying to tell one of such extreme group  to calm their fucking tits and stop being deluded. They must have colectively marked my comments as spam. 

Never challenge your bubble of delusions... 
Your agenda is the most important agenda... 

oh wait you should call it nicer. 

Hate banwagon? 

Oh no, no, no that's even worse.

It's the only way of life....

Well, being selfish cunt has officialy become a positive thing.

I just can't cope with this shitty world. It feels like being surrounded by zombies."
1731,Can I trust any therapist with suicidal tendencies?,"I need to get this off of my chest:

I've been talking to my therapist about a more philosophical viewpoint on suicide. To sum it up: He told me that it is his professional duty to prevent any suicide attempt by any means necessary. Regardless on how he personally feels about it. This is for me scary. I've been already hospitalized in a psych ward earlier this year and it was an awful experience. Boredom, unstable patients, no freedom, no activities.

The thought of me being potentially locked up for an unknown amount of time for just being a danger to myself is unbearable and I'll rather be dead than in a prison-like institution.

Can I trust any therapist with saying that I have concrete suicide plans?"
1732,I just want to be in a coma,"Self induced coma. I'm sure there is a way. Stupid I'm talking on some forums where no one really knows you . Title sounds stupid text sounds like a stupid fucking teenager begging for help. Fuck every single person who ever thought they were shit. Sucks reaching a point in life where no one else could ever hurt me again but my life is constant pain every single day I have to hear the person I love scream and scream and not be able to stop..
BUT WHAT IS TERRIBLE IS. I can't get in her head. What if she is just weak and can stop? I have never felt many emotions. Why can't I just say something and it work? There Is no help for people with no insurance in America. Fuck the system and fuck whoever's supports it. 

They want you to go to college do shit yadda yadda but If I wanted I could make 3-500 dollars a day selling but my girl can't let me even sell now because I don't have a spot to sell out of and she gets too anxious when I'm gone. 

Fuck this I want to get OUT.A

NOW MY ORGINIAL title doesn't even make sense. 


I just wish I had the BALLS to do it because every night I go to sleep I wish I stayed asleep but then I get scared like a PUSSY about dying. I'm too scared my last thoughts will be REGRETTING dying and not being able to do anything about it

But FUCK it I have to die eventually. Maybe if I get fucked up or drunk or something I'll lower my inhibitions and it'll be easier to just do IT

BON VOYAGE MOTHERCUKERS HOPEFULLY IM DEAD BY 2020"
1733,I feel better,I set the date and made the decision of when everything will be done
1734,Should I kill other people before dying?,"Hear me out.  I had perfectly treatable medical conditions.  Problems that would of cost mere hundreds to solve. No one helped me. I became disabled and months continue to go by.  It took becoming a criminal to raise the money for myself.

Should I kill everyone responsible?"
1736,Feeling numb,"A few months ago my boyfriend and I were robbed at gunpoint. Didn’t feel real at all. I felt like the whole time it was happening I was watching myself. It’s hit me that what happened was real. Not going into detail, but lots of other things could have happened to me. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I was going to be sex trafficked if my boyfriend wasn’t there.

I see news articles and videos that make me feel guilty that I lived. Why? I don’t know. I see things like “Single Father of Two. Robbed and Killed” and it just makes me feel so AWFUL. I’m so thankful that I lived but why? Why did I get so lucky? I don’t have family, I don’t have children, it wouldn’t effect much if I died. Then I feel so guilt because those people would be so thankful to be alive. Why did I get to?? What is my purpose? I’m too scared now to leave my house. What if something bad happens again? You can’t predict it, that’s what drives me crazy. Why can’t I get over this?? Why am I so awful??

The weed and alcohol isn’t helping me get rid of this feeling anymore. Too pussy to try anything else. I want to be happy. Why can’t I let things go? Why can’t I just be thankful? I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be here anymore. I wish I didn’t exist. That feeling of like i’m watching myself, it hasn’t gone away since then. I just don’t want to feel like a shell."
1737,"I’ve been thinking about it a lot, not sure if I’ll go through with it eventually.","life’s been an absolute bitch and I’m not sure what I’m going to do with my “future”. I have friends who love and support me very much and it would pain me if I hurt them by doing this, but I honestly don’t know how much more I can take. they’ve been helping me so so much lately with everything but I honestly don’t think it’s ever going to get better from here. I might not go through with the new year."
1738,I've hit a brick wall,"I don't know what is going on with me anymore, I have my plan in place and written a note hoping no one will find it."
1739,Feels like it’s over already.,"Throwaway account. 

Bear with me, this is a bit lengthy.  

To preface, I’m a high school student in an affluent and progressive town. My parents have no issues with money and I’ve lived my whole life with all the luxuries and pleasures that can be afforded to a kid. 

My parents are both Soviet-born. Smart people who worked hard and came up from nothing to build a far better life for our family. For this I have nothing but the utmost respect for them. A few years back I was found out as gay by them, they walked in on me and a “friend” kissing in the basement. It was ugly. I understand the struggle isn’t uniquely my own — but I truly hope no one has to hear their own mother call them a faggot in a hysteric fit of tears. 

All this brought up a lot of shit I kept hidden in the back of my head. When I was 7 I was molested by a complete stranger. I’d lived for years actively trying to pretend it never happened.... but developing feelings for another boy brought it all back. What if that terrible experience made me gay? Was it my fault?

All this burst into my carefully controlled life as if a dam had just been broken. My grades in high school dropped, I had no motivation, stopped talking to friends, and generally disengaged. That summer after a breakup with my then boyfriend I found myself hospitalized for suicidal ideation. 

It Was hell. An all expenses paid trip to the shoelace-free hotel — no — *prison*. It made me swear off ever trying to get help again. I called the hotline to talk to a single sympathetic human being in a time of crisis, I had no intention of killing myself — I made that clear. And still I found myself institutionalized for a week. 

My parents (obviously) were livid. They grew up in a society so diametrically opposed to the conversation of mental health, that they themselves were alien to it all. And now their son who “grew up fearing god” (my fathers words)  was contemplating suicide? 

That leads us to here. Today. Two months ago I got broken up with again. It’s a crucial year academically and I’ve only now realized that with my abysmally low GPA I stand no chance of getting into even the state school I wanted to go to. I have these grandiose dreams of one day being a lawyer and having a life that’s my own, but quite frankly sitting here now with a 2.9 GPA, it all feels like a pipe dream. I’m not an idiot by any means (I don’t think so at least) but I am on paper, as a statistic.

I’m scheduled to take my first standardized test tomorrow, I’m a mess. I don’t want to die but it feels like I’ve practically wasted the only life I’ve been given."
1740,Really considering right now. Feeling extremely hopeless.,"I feel like I don't fit in the world. There's been so much heartache and bs the whole ride. I feel humiliated because of my problems. Something happened today to set me off. Wishing I could talk to someone right now. Wishing I had a guardian angel that would hold me when I was feeling like this. And my family? They just gaslight me, stonewall me, and have conversations where they are laughing with others. They do this deliberately. They refuse to talk to me or hear me. Then they conversate with friends in person where they know I can here it. They laugh to make me feel left out and like something is wrong with me. They've always done this anytime they've done something to hurt me. They just refuse to hear me, leave and make me feel at fault."
1742,"Don't know if I'll kill myself, snap and leave reality, or leave and be homeless across the country","It's hard seeing the person you love go through pain every single day hitting herself screaming terrible panic attacks, failing school classes( this one's thrown in there but I don't really give a fuxk ), feeling nothing , making mistakes you can't take back . Reading that makes me sound like a fucking kid lmao. 
Well anyways I always imagine me shooting myself I put the gun to my head yesterday without putting one in the chamber to practice , but that might be too scary for me honestly. I think I'd die in fear if the last thing I heard was a loud ass gun shot. Maybe something more peaceful for me. Wish I could ask for recommendations.  But anyways. Maybe I won't kill.myself. I'm just trapped here because I love someone who holds me back only because of how hard of a situation she's going through. But we don't have insurance and no money so she can't get help. But leaving her behind would kill me from how much pain shed be in .

Maybe I'll just snap and put myself I.n another plain of reality like I do some times. Actually I wish I would snap and go crazy. To be honest I try. I try and go crazy.  My head is jumbled and sometimes it does scencoairs especially if I'm going crazy. But I really wish I'd just snap completely and be crazy that way nothing could hurt me I'd be in my own little bubble if I thought I were God or something."
1743,I just survived a near fatal attempt and I'm not happy I woke up. I'm not okay.,"I recently attempted suicide via OD. I was in a coma from sat to Thursday that week, I woke up on thanksgiving. I don't remember an entire 1.5 weeks of time. 

I'm not happy I woke up. I'm not happy I got saved. 

I had taken 125 pills, but now I have counted out and saved 480 plus like four scripts I have yet to even pick up. 

I don't have the balls to do it again, but I do know that if I do, it will be a success this time. 

Shit that drove me to the attempt is still there now, only way way worse.

I am not okay, and I don't know how to reach out for help without getting immediately hospitalized again. Hospitalization does not help, it only makes things worse. Hell, i dont even know if I want help, but I had to get this off my chest somewhere, it is heavy holding on to the secrets alone. =("
1744,My baby makes me want to die,"I don't think I have postpartum depression. It's been 16 months since we had the baby and increasingly I find myself thinking of how much I want to die. I spend my days at home with my child crying and envisioning just leaving her in a safe place and ending my life. I still am barely able to do what I need to do to be there for her but it has been so difficult and I can't see any happy times in the future due to my baby possibly having autism. Everything is a struggle with her. She doesn't eat well, sleep well, communicate at all, throws epic tantrums all day and night. She's going to be in therapy probably for a long time. It's always going to be a struggle and I already can't deal with it. I think it would be better to die now as she doesn't seem to have any particular attachment to me. In fact I rather suspect that she does not like me at all. She doesn't give her daddy near as many issues as she does me. I have pills and alcohol and guns in the house. I have a car and I often think about just driving it into the Mississippi because I don't want to chance the possibility of being able to be saved. I have tried to talk to my husband about needing more time for myself, more help for the baby, maybe going to therapy, etc., But he just shuts down and won't talk about it. He thinks there is nothing wrong with her, and I have no idea what he thinks about all my sadness. Somehow all of my needs get left behind always. Sometimes I think I am being selfish and I feel guilty and that just makes everything worse. And we have arguments whenever I can actually get him to talk to me about anything. My baby is so messed up already and I don't think that I am helping her by not being able to be the best mother for her. Having her was the worst mistake of my life and I don't know where to go from here. I would get a divorce but I don't want to have to deal with the guilt of leaving him alone with a special needs child. But I also don't want to spend the rest of my life as a robot who does nothing but cook, clean and take care of a child who is incapable of loving me and a man who doesn't treat me like a partner. He has changed dramatically from the person I was in love with. All my friends dropped off the face of the planet when I had the baby and attempts at trying to make new friends have all failed, leaving me more isolated and frustrated. My family is non-existent and his family is a critical and unhelpful Trainwreck. I miss my job. I miss sleeping. I miss having hobbies and free time. I miss self-care. I miss sex. I have no identity anymore. I am not me. I am not going to hurt my baby for sure but I can't promise the same for myself."
1745,Please someone just take the pain away,"I haven’t eaten in days and don’t plan to.  I’m going to die young, hated, alone, and in love with my ex.  That’s what really broke me.  We were so in love, I swear.  And then out of the fucking blue, I’m right back where I started.  Depressed, lonely, and suicidal.  I can’t do it anymore.  I’m so fucking alone.  No one gives a shit about me.  All they do is use me and leave.  He said he loved me to death.  I guess he was right"
1746,What do most suicidal people think leading up to suicide and how long do they think that way?,
1747,Live and suffer or die and pass the suffering?,"Recently I had a trip on mushrooms and developed HPPD.  I have been stuck in a bad trip for a month now.  Depersonalization/derealization is my reality now.  Its like my soul left me.  Some days Ill wake up and have full blown psychedelic visuals.  I was already diagnosed with CPTSD and BPD from childhood trauma and this just seals the deal.  Every moment of every day I just want to die. I just can't imagine the magnitude of hurt I'll pass onto my family, especially my mom.  

I'm sick of crying all day.

I'm sick of the anxiety eating away at my soul just for breathing.

I'm sick of feeling disconnected from myself and reality.

The real question is can you still get into heaven if you kill yourself?"
1748,I’m going over the balcony...,
1749,I see no other way out,"I suffer from BPD. Been to therapy and on antidepressants before, nothing's worked so far. I keep pushing away the people that care about me. I hate the loneliness. I entered a severe depression episode and stopped going to school, failed all my classes, and basically screwed up my plans for the future. I live in constant emotional pain. Can't even get out of bed. I'm just so tired, I just need a break from my own mind. I tried to kill myself three times before, when I was 13, when I was 19 and a couple of months ago, but I'm too much of a coward and I'm scared of the pain. I'm not afraid of dying, just of the pain that comes before it, or the possibility that I may not succeed and end up suffering more. I also resent my family for wanting to keep me alive when they see how much pain I go through daily. I think it's selfish of me to want to end everything, but I also think it's selfish of them they'd rather see me suffer every day of my life."
1750,I failed my finals,I want to die even worse. School is the only thing i half have going for me. And i even suck at that.
1751,People care more about proving themselves right than listening to me and accepting me for who I am.,"I hate this world for being so cruel. It's always been cruel to me, just because I'm ""weird"" compared to most other people. Most people might say they care about suicidal people like us, but in reality, they don't give a SHIT. They say things to us that they know push us over the edge, just because they think it's the ""truth."" They don't listen, they just run their mouths.

I feel like I could stay in this world if people would just respect my identity and treat me the way I want to be treated. But no. They'd rather force me into society's preordained box. They'd rather see me dead than treat me as the little girl I am. 

So fuck all of you that treat me like garbage. Fuck all of you that won't accept me for who I am. When I'm dead you better not DARE come to my funeral or post on social media about how ""sorry"" you are for my passing, and how much you care about suicide victims.

BULLSHIT!!! You only care about them if they're normal, valuable, socially acceptable people."
1752,"I am strongly thinking about killing myself right now. Closed in the bathroom and with a razor blade close. I've tried to get help from my friends, make them understand I need help, but no one understands. But I can't bear all this pain anymore.",
1753,"If I get out of bed, I'll kill myself. Should I just stay in bed until my therapy appointment later today?",
1754,I got fired today,"I wrote a bit ago about how I was reprimanded at work, and how it made me really depressed. Or maybe I wrote that on the depression subreddit. But either way, I was terminated from my job today.

I really, really liked this job. But this is the third time I've been fired from a job. And it's always the same reason, I am a condescending jerk who doesn't respect his coworkers or authority.

I try, but I keep making the same mistakes. The first time I can just assume that I was not the right fit for the job. The second time, I worry that I need to improve and I actively try to make those improvements in myself. But this third time... This is an obvious pattern and the key factor is me.

The worst thing is that I know a lot of these behaviors are the same behaviors that made my last relationship go sour. I thought I was improving upon them and getting better. I spent 20 minutes at the end of every week going over what I had done and how to be better, but I still ended up here. I lost the job I really love for the same reason I lost the person I really love.

I can only conclude that I am a failure."

I've been deeply depressed for months, and experienced more frequent suicidal thoughts. I feel so isolated because I'm ashamed to open up about my financial struggle when everyone around me talks about how paralegals make such good money. I can't ask for help from my parents, they're having their own struggles. It's hard for me to focus on my passion for creative writing because I'm always stressed about how or when I'll have my next meal. I don't know what to do anymore.

1772,My back hurts,Dayum been hurtin for a while
1773,I am 19 and feel like life has nothing left in store for me,"Hello everyone, 

It took a lot of time and guts for me to post here. Mainly because I felt and feel like this is insignificant compared to what other people here have been through. The last few days however, my thoughts and dreams about death have become more extreme and specific.

In July of this year I graduated high school. Shortly after in October I started university studies of history and French which I cancelled two weeks ago. 
In October my girlfriend broke up with me and she’ll go away (to another country) for six months with the possible intention of staying there. 

In the weeks before our finals I realised how much I was going to be lost, when school would be over. I never thought I would miss school when I was younger but now I just wish myself back there every single day. 
I switched schools for the last two years before graduation and began to love it. The new people at the new school were massively supporting and welcoming and I also got to know my, now ex, girlfriend in that time. 
Ever since all that has disappeared from my life and I “suddenly” have to know and choose who and what I am going to be later, I feel lost. Now that seemed normal to me at first, I mean everyone kinda has to figure out who he is at some point of their lives, but I fell in a hole that had no bottom. My girlfriend was, and I know that may sound stupid coming from an 19 year old, the love of my life. I had a girlfriend before but with her everything was different. We connected in so many ways, I never thought it was possible. Possible to love like that.
She had previously had a hard time psychologically and had been taking anti-depressants without her parents knowing, before we really got to know each other. That psychological scar she had, I could periodically see, when she began to cry for no obvious reason and “out of nowhere” and I always tried to care  for her and comfort her as good as I could and told her not to be, when she said she was sorry for being “broken”. Throughout the year of graduation we had a lot of great times together and she made me happier as I was ever before. We talked about our future a lot and it all seemed mature and “real” on a whole different level, than I had ever experienced or expected to experience before.

To shorten this, she became my pillar and my anchor.

When we started to disconnect I became increasingly unsure of what I wanted to do for a living later. We were planning on becoming teachers together. I started at university to fulfil that idea but quickly realised that I could not enjoy a second of it.
I slowly sank in a dark place and could not really enjoy anything for real. I began to flee into video games and books, movies and poetry and barely left my room.
I did not only feel alone, I felt this void that swallowed everything and anyone that was there for me until I forgot about all the people that are here for me. I felt alone despite not being alone at all. One friend of mine wasn’t giving up on me that quick and she has been trying to talk and care/love me out of that ever enlarging hole I find myself in. She is the only one that knows I am thinking about killing myself. But she does not know how severe these thoughts are getting.

I have to clarify; I do not want to die. But I do want to flee all of what makes my life a living hell every single day. I feel like a coward, even though I know suicide has nothing to do with being a coward. I feel like I am being unreasonable but still am starting to see no other way out of this misery. Pulling the plug would erase me like an unwanted hard drive. I am not religious and do not believe there is something after death. The nothingness is beginning to look friendlier with every night I lay in my bed staring in the darkness unable to drift of in dreams that end with me dying, waking me up and leaving me disappointed. Disappointed to still be here.
My friend tried to explain to me how my family and friends love and respect me and could not forgive themselves for losing me and I get that. Hell, every time I think about just doing it, I see them and am thinking about how I do not want them to be sad and all. I never think how shit being dead might be for me."
1774,Is sleeping in a hot car effective?,"Is it hard to kill myself that way? I have no chemicals, gun, etc... or money"
1775,I am a waste of oxygen and deserve to die.,"Let's see. Where do I even begin? I am a 19 year old soon to be 20 year old virgin who has never held hands with a girl or had any sort of romantic experience. The mere thought of another female being interested in me sounds absurd. I have no job. I rely on my mother for basic necessities such as clothes, food, and hygiene.  I have no license because of my social anxiety disorder and unwillingness to study for my permit test. 

I am in my first semester of college and I am barley passing most of my classes. My GPA is around 2.5 and I don't expect it go up. You know how college is supposed to be a time where you meet people and make new friends? I have made NO friends at all. Nada, zelch, zero. I commute to school back and forth and spend the rest of my days playing videogames, eating, and masturbating. 

I am a PORN addict. I cannot go even three days without looking up some sort of sexually explicit material. To be honest, I use porn to self medicate and dull the pain of having no intimacy and relationships with women. All my efforts to cut out porn have been in vain.

1777,Someone please talk me out of this.,Im currently suicidal because after 4 months of being dumped by my ex he already has a new girl and is treating her better than he treated me. I wanna kill myself i still love him so much ill never find someone like him again. Ive written a note and im thinking of jumping off the nearest bridge. Im ugly worthless and pathetic without him. I want to die.. no i need to die. But deep down i dont want to
1778,Unpopular opinion: Sometimes it's ok to let people go.,"""Life sucks but it's how it is and you can't die because of that"", I'm so tired of listening to that. Nobody will understand the real reason I would like to kill myself. There's more about the *I* than the *others*. I'm too sensitive, everything superior to me lets me terribly down and we all know that thinking about people who's in a worse situation than me is something that won't work at all. 

This is something very personal. My best friend has the best genetics one can imagine and he's even very lucky. As I said, everything superior to me literally puts me down. I always suffered from depression but this friendship has increased it a lot to the point I transmitted him my depression. He said ""I want to die because of your incurable depression"" and I was like FUCK, you have everything, you get used stuff that work better than the ones I get new, you got free passes to do plane spotting inside the airport and I have never stepped on the apron for anything else but boarding under pressure, you got a beautiful family with great education and I'm raised by two almost fascist boomers, you are heterosexual and I'm just a fucking ugly useless faggot. How would you ever die for my depression, let me fucking go and don't feel guilty for that. He already would let me go but he would feel guilty, and it's not the proper way. I want to go because I work my ass to be competent with this society and I try my best to be the top of myself, I don't compete with anyone but try to improve myself and nobody notices improvement, I don't notice it either. The more I live the more I suffer. It's awful. I would spend all what I have on self euthanasia right now because I just can't live anymore, but I can't die knowing that this man will feel guilty for nothing but me, myself and the fight I have with my demons."
1779,I’m just the Toxic One,"I think I finally realized that maybe I’m just the toxic person in my life and everyone else that I meet. I have serious mental issues I seem to never get pass and always screw other people with them. After giving my bf another chance and giving him hope that we can still work, I keep taking it away and hurting him even more than ever I feel so fucking bad. I hate putting my shit on people especially when I know they already have their shit dealing with. Maybe I should just stop, suck it up and move on cause it’s life, just need to learn to deal with it and stop cause so much of a problem to everyone around me."
1780,"I wanna die so badly rn, I don’t want my life taken away from me and I don’t want to disappoint my parents. I rather die and never see their reaction.","I skipped the entire quarter of school.  THE ENTIRE QUARTER!  I went the first day, and never went back.  I was so stupid and lazy and I’m just such an idiot.  I got an F in art and a V (vanish) in English.  Pretty sure my math will be bad too.  I literally can’t believe I did this.  Thought I was gonna get away with it and move on and eventually deal with it later.  But now I’m having my school loan taken away, and I can’t pay for it myself.  I’d have to tell my parents that I’ve been lying to them this whole time.  It’s high school all over again and I’m scared this will fuck everything up.  Things were going so well and I fucked it up.  I’m not ready to give everything up.  I don’t wanna have to tell my parents.  I can get an appeal but I don’t have my SS number and it would be weird to ask.  I’m fucking done.  Maybe the appeal might work and I’ll get my loan back but my parents would still be disappointed in me and never trust me again.  I just want to die."
1781,"I have a plan, I've written a note. I'm scared.","I'm wrestling with a lot right now. I dont want to kill myself, but I do want to die. I want the pain I'm experiencing to just end. I feel so hopeless and like nothing I do will ever matter and that nobody will miss me when I'm gone. I know that's not true but I am really struggling. I'm wondering if I should check myself into a mental hospital."

Gone untreated 4yrs, episodes escalating.","I’m thinking about harming myself then going to the ER. I’m too afraid to call 911, but would it be better in my case to do so?"
1785,Things have gotten so much worse after surviving a hanging attempt,"I wont elaborate much on my personal BS, but I'm painfully lonely, ugly, stupid, and incredibly unlikable. Ive failed 5 courses now and im in my 3rd year of engineering, I honestly feel that my friends,classmates, and profs couldnt care less if I killed myself. To prove my point further, in my first year I missed an electricity lab due to getting into a car accident. I tried explaining that to the professor, just for her to reply ""your method of transport to school is not my problem"". About a month ago I tried hanging myself, I dont know how long I was up there. I just remember waking up on the floor in a panic with no memory of what happened. 

Ever since  that night things have just continued to go downhill, school got worse, Ive done a god awful job at maintaining friendships. Is there any hope honestly? I feel like such a burden to my family and those around me."

1788,Stabbing,"I don’t have any guns, nor know anyone with them. Hanging/pills/jumping from a bridge have too low of a success rate. My plan is to stab myself in the chest/ribs deeply for as many times I can handle it and hope the blood loss and trauma is enough to take me.


I’ve been on this sub for a while, posting over the last two years. I’m surprised I’m still alive, but lately the end is really coming for me. I didn’t get accepted into my reach school and don’t want to spend the rest of my life in student debt being a disappointment to everyone who knows me. When my dad died everyone said “well at least he gets to go be in peace and be reunited with his mom now” but I don’t get any of the same forgiveness. Meanwhile I have to stay alive at all costs like my life is worth something. I’ve lived in it for 17 years, I know it isn’t and will never be."
1789,I see the end in sight,"I'll try and keep politics out of this, but let's just say the end of the national health service being in sight means the end of my life. I'll be completely fucked. I picked a day in January. People are selfish, uncaring and they despise people like me. I don't know why, but they do. Hope there's a light at the end of the tunnel for you guys one day."
1790,An anniversary...,"Today is the one year anniversary of my friend's suicide. He terrorised his wife (my best friend), and his two kids before putting a hunting rifle to his head. When his brother managed to open the garage door, with the police standing in front of it, prepared for something else, he was still alive, barely. And then he wasn't. 
 I was a bridesmaid at their wedding... drugs eventually changed him....made him lose his mind. He was a good person before it took over...

They heard it. They were home. 

As soon as my friend's mom phoned me we drove there. We sat at the house for 4 hours waiting for the coroner to come. My boyfriend had to help them put the body in the vehicle. I saw blood and skull and far more than I should have. I held my friend as she cried and struggled to breathe. I tried to convince her she wasn't dying and it was a panic attack. I took her and the kids to my house and talked....and talked... and talked. 
It stays with me. Its ingrained in my mind, my memories and it haunts me EVERY day. 

RIP CJ...."
1791,Just found out,"I just found out my boyfriend hasn't been getting better. I thought he had been, but he told me last night that the reason we haven't been having as much conflict for the past several weeks is because he's been ""hiding himself from me"". I should have seen it before. I guess I just thought that maybe he was figuring out how to handle his suicidal thoughts (don't knock me, I'm suicidal too and I understand what he's going through), but then he tells me yesterday that he's just been pushing them down and not talking to me about it. 

I don't know how I'm supposed to feel. Should I feel guilty because I didn't figure it out earlier that he wasn't actually getting better? Or should I be upset that even though we told each other we could tell each other anything he didn't tell me something crucial like that? 

I feel like he's made the problems worse by hiding them. We fought last night for the first time in a long time. I feel so stupid and careless for not seeing it."
1792,Angry Suicide?,"Has anyone else ever felt so angry you wanted to die? Perhaps I’m confusing my emotions, but recently I find myself becoming so frustrated and defeated that I’m consumed with rage and want to actively harm myself, sometimes to the point of death. I’ve been suicidal before because of immense sadness, but this anger thing is new. Thoughts?"

1795,"I think I'll just get high a couple more times, then when I'm about to run out I'll od in my sleep.","TL;DR - Suffering has no objective value and thus I don't want to waste my time suffering anymore. 

Subjective - Personal views, opinions, value granted by how we perceive things

Objective - Fact, the same regardless of who perceives it, outside of our opinions and beliefs

Since we don't know what value our actions hold after life, making the value of things indeterminable, they hold no objective value during our life. We can assign personal, subjective reasons to continue living and doing things, like being of service to others, or being as happy as possible, or finding purpose through responsibility. These don't give permanent, objective value, but they do provide some relief in terms of providing purpose. They've stopped providing relief for me. Some people literally say not to think about it, because there is a positive correlation between thinking about it and being dissatisfied with life, and to that I say that I know I keep asking questions hoping that the next answer will make me just a little less miserable, but I don't want to get sucked into suffering if there's just no point. Some people say that the purpose of suffering is gratitude for good. This is ok I guess, but that's subjective value, not objective. Then there's the real big problem, I don't think I would be happier if there was some grand purpose. I would feel trapped, miserable. At least in this case we can assign our own value to things, like yay, minor victory! I'd rather just stop, say goodbye to the things I love, then leave this life behind peacefully. 

Sorry for the rant, hope someone takes the time to read and respond to this :(."
1796,I can't go on,"I can't keep living like this, and I want to lock myself in the garage with the car running. I don't see a point in my future where I'll look back and be glad I didn't kill myself."
1797,This subreddit is absolutely disgusting!,"Everyone just sits back and basically encourages people to kill themselves. Only a few people ask to talk to the person, and the rest of you just say “farewell” and “what are you gonna do for the last day”. Have some fucking heart you sick bastards. Go ahead and ban me mods. I’m gonna be reporting all of this to the police."

1799,Anyone From Canada?,"Specifically Ontario? I desperately want to end my life and the only options that are immediately available are hanging and getting hit by a train, both of which terrify me and from what I've read online, the level of pain and duration of time until death is not something I can put myself through 

Please someone I just want to find someone that makes sense, everyone sounds like they are speaking nonsense, I have told people about my depression but not the suicidal thoughts and I always get things like ""hey in there bud"" or ""oh you never know what the future holds"". Is everybody fucking stupid? I'm supposed to continue this miserable shit because everyone around me has an irrational obligation to continue the silly pointless game of life? Fuck them."
1800,the accusations of hypochondria make me want to smash peoples teeth out,"I have been living with unbearable physical pain for over an entire year and I have been ridiculed, mocked and had my pain aggravated constantly ever since July 2018 when I became sick.

Now that my pain is getting worse all I can think about is the arguments, and violent retribution on those who hurt me.

I cant even remember what its like to not feel sick and have pain all I remember is violent fantasies that go back years."
1801,I don't know if I can manage the next time,"It's always the long way to the top, and a second-long fall back in the ashes. I know people talk about the three-days rule, when thinking about suicide you're monitoring the next three days and try to see at least one good thing in them, which should make you want to keep up. But I know it will become better, it will be that I won't care about anything which made me feel down earlier. Like a nice sleep where you solve all of your problems or they fade. But when it's back, I don't only suffer from what's affecting me right now, no. Everything comes back, the realization that it has never gotten better and definitely will not. And with each time I become more and more afraid I will not manage the next come. I never attempted seriously, but I was at the very edge once, and everytime it's here, I feel that day like it's here, along with all the other terrible days."
1802,Want to go by the end of the year- it is the only humane way.,"At 48, I have no milestones in life. Almost no romantic history. I have no clue even how to make friends, and at my age it is difficult  for even normal people. I question if I'm attractive or not to women, but I'm not sure that is my problem. I'm on the thin side(not muscular) but have no problem running 15 miles. I'm also a serious skater. I don't smoke or drink.

I'll never have a family or children, very unlikely at this point. I thought about sex workers but the thought really disgusts me. Who wants to buy something like that, and around here the cops have nothing better to do than set up stings for desperate men. I would never think of any shit like that if I had a loving wife. It is not even so much for the sex but just for touch and someone to talk to. It would probably end up as death by cop in that case, better than the humiliation.

I do make money but I don't travel because of upbringing and fears. I have a successful tech business, make well into the 6 figures. But money is worthless if you can't enjoy it. How much shit can your order from Amazon? You get happy for a day after the big TV arrives, then you feel worse. I'm invisible to the world. I hate this existence, I wish I wasn't born. I would NEVER choose to come here.  Seriously, I already feel dead, this is like a dry run. No one even acknowledges my existence in the world.

I research ""humane"" suicide. I love cars, and CO looks like a great way to go. No one is going to find me for a long time anyway, so it is 100% sure bet for me. No one is really going to miss me. I read lots of men around my age commit suicide, and they have kids too. I truly have nothing and at my age it is over."
1803,Having no friends is going to kill me,"It’s so hard to explain this frustration to others. The average person has friends, a group, a support system etc. They don’t know how hard life is without them. They say shit like “who needs friends” “focus on hustling instead” “people are temporary who gives a fuck”.  But they’ll never really know how detrimental it is to ur development &amp; mental health. 

I’m only 21, and I feel like I haven’t had real friends since 16. They come and go, ditch me, forget about me, fuck me over or treat me like shit. I’m sick of it. I don’t even know how to make new friends and the effort of changing friends each year is exhausting. I’m not the type to get along with everyone &amp; make friends easily. No one gives a shit about me. I have no one to do things with or go out with. I’m wasting my youth by decaying at home doing nothing - lonely and bored out of my brain. The few distant glimpses of real friendship I’ve had in life pierce my heart with their memories."
1804,Anyone open to talk?,"I'm really confused, and frustrated. Quite frankly, I don't know what to do from here on out. I'm a junior in highschool if it helps to put things in perspective I guess."
1805,I need help,"Sorry in advance if I format this incorrectly. I want to give a trigger warning that this post will include the topic of suicide.

This is kind of my last resort, I know I shouldn't expect strangers online to help and I really don't even know what I need or want from this but I guess just someone to listen. I have been having a hard time but unlike previous times that I've felt sad, I can't link this to anything. I'm 21 and just opened a store so that has caused some stress but I'm doing what I really want to do so I should be happy, right? 

Everyday I just get worse, my chest feels heavy and I just feel constantly sad and for the past few weeks the thought of suicide has come up in my mind more and more. I have tried talking to people, my boyfriend says he wants to help, and I know he cares, but he doesn't know what to do and I can understand that. I don't want to put my problems on him. I have tried talking to my family and I always get the same ""your life is good, what do you have to be sad about?""

I'm just at home right now, alone, and the thought of suicide is now starting to feel more and more real. I don't want to be sad but I don't know what to do and I am in so much pain. I also don't like the idea of antidepressants because I was on Cymbalta for anxiety (before I felt depressed) and it completely f'ed me over emotionally and physically (that's a story for another day) so I'm really weary of going on another antidepressant. 

I don't know what I want from this but thankyou for listening."
1806,I was going to kill myself wednesday,"The title says it all. I had stayed at a friends house the night before, I had my note, my plan, and I had told my friend goodbye for what I thought was going to be the last time. I got in my car, put on my music and was heading down his driveway. He and his mom came running out and stopped me from leaving. They forced me to say. He told his mom he thought I was going to end it. So there I sat because my mom told me to stay there and she was going to pick me up. I really wonder if I was meant to die. I'm looking back right now, I lost my only chance I had to die."
1807,My 32nd birthdays are today.,"But I'm not celebrating.

I could write here my story, but since amount of topics here is so big, it would most likely be gone in a second, so there's no use writing anything long.

Adolescence is overrated. 

Teens want to grow up, do adult things, but only after you lose it, you know what have you lost.

I don't see any benefits of being an adult, I can legally buy and drink alcohol, and that's it. I'm not even into it, as I have weak head. Very few benefits, plenty of responsibilities that don't pay off.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to do some shopping for today, and saturday/sunday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Saw my school mate from &lt; high school, she has 2 kids already, while I'm still lost in time. That's what trauma is. And that's also why I mentioned adolescence. Things don't change that much, I'd say, they don't change at all. Just because I'm older, grown up in general, it's still me. If you know what I mean. Still the same me, the very same that I remember. My views might drift, but the rest remains in status quo.

I used to think, that if reincarnation exists, I might one day have a chance to live the life I always wanted, but I doubt. My life has been filled with negativity since day 0. It's all I know. 

I wanted to believe that somehow ""**apple does not fall far from the tree**"" is a lie, but it turned out to be 200% true. How can I live a good life, if all I was shown were bad things, I was taught bad habbits, and the worst of all I inherited poverty, on top of stupidity + more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll never move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Money would help but, but wouldn't solve everything, pain is permanent, it's a stain, or how I call it ""mental rape"". 

&amp;#x200B;

My internals still hurt, but monday, who knows, I'll get up early, and be done with it."
1808,Failure,"Since I hit 30 this summer any kind of hopeful thoughts about the future just seem stupid or like the opportunity already passed. For the last 10-11 years I've been failing at multiple universities and been stuck in the ""student"" life. Obviously my use of cannabis that's been part of my life for as long plays a big part in my failures. Gradually my social life has completely dissipated and I have no friends left. My love life is as pathetic as it is empty. I'm still trying to graduate with an exam but again my studies are starting to fail. Basically for the last decade I've been mostly high and either playing video games or watching some pirated show or movie. I can not begin to explain how little I think of myself and how I constantly fantasize about the relief of not existing at all. Can't say that I lost my sense of purpose since I've never had one. I don't know what I want from life anymore since everything I used to want is so far out of reach it's pointless to reach for at all. I know that I will die bitter and alone, so why suffer and spread the darkness to my family. I tried a bit of honesty while on the phone with my mother earlier today and, like the toxic piece of human garbage I am, I only made her cry and feel hopeless. I know my psychological addiction to cannabis plays a big part in my life and does nothing good but offer temporary relief. But the shame makes it impossible to talk to anyone about. I'm going to try shut down any and all emotions for the holidays together with family. Once another lone New Year's Eve have past and the potential holiday associations are over, I'm done."
1809,Does somebody dive in swimming pool and want to stay there for as long as possible just feel the silence and to float?,
1810,It doesn’t get better,"Tried to kill myself last night and somehow got arrested for it. It’s not going to get better. Now I can’t even get a job. The only people who would even notice I’m gone are my dogs, and I’ve already told my mom to come get them. 

Graham, I love you and I’m sorry."
1811,I think today is the day,It is too much to unpack in this post. My boyfriend broke up with me. I’ve been best friends with him for so long and he had become the person I lean on and trust. It has completely broken my entire being. We have a home and a dog together and I have been so happy where I am at. Now that it is over I am having to quit my job and move away from all of my friends to live with my mom. Everything that I have worked for and the life I created with him has been ripped away and I just don’t have the energy to restart. I don’t have the energy to pack my things or talk to anyone. I just want it to be over.
1812,"I can’t hold down a job, any job I get pays dirt. No marketable skills whatsoever. +I have a criminal record. No friends or love.","Just a completely unsuccesfull person, life is so unenjoyable since I ruined it. Why shouldn’t I just end it?"
1813,The fantasy that keeps me going,"I'm 28. Born to shitty and selfish parents who never taught me how to function in the world. I have a son, but I feel like my mother is trying to poison him against me. Every time I try to escape, I last a few months and then poverty brings me back to one of my parents. (They're separated.) I'd elaborate more on how awful these people are but I don't want to think about it rn. But what keeps me going is this fantasy that maybe I can save up every dime of child support I get (my asshole dad cost me my last job by abusing my son. Couldn't trust him to watch my kid for an hour after school) getting a cheap RV and going on permanent vacation with my son. Maybe use fake ids so no one will find us.  We'd go touring national parks until we find somewere to park it for good. Somewhere so far out in the boondocks no one will think to look for us. We could hunt and fish and live off the land for the most part. My son's dad is as close to a deadbeat as you can be while still paying child support. But also a control freak. I could make it work with some careful planning. I just have to NOT kill my entire family and myself first."
1814,Sometimes it's too difficult,"Growing up my mom often said I was a bad kid and sometimes I wonder if her and my step-dad still have the younger me in their heads and not the adult one. Since a young age, she would talk to me about her problems, insecurities, especially about her family. She would always say that I'm the only person she can talk to and she would joke that I'm somewhat like a therapist for her.
 
As a teenager, I was never popular and really sensitive and caring about others. When my sister started being a teenager, my mom really wanted her to be popular so she isn't ""like me"". Meaning: not cool and not a lot of friends. She says my sister is a strong character and good looking so that's why she's now popular. My mother always says she doesn't compare us but I feel like she does. She never called me pretty out of nowhere but she's always saying how my sister is pretty. She does say I'm pretty when I ask and when she compares my friend she says I'm one of the prettiest but one of my friends is prettier than me. When she says that I'm like ""okay, at least she's honest"" but it still bothers me because as a parent, as that something you shouldn't say and if it is true, is it better to just say a little white lie because I feel like parents words are the ones that hurt the most.
 
I know sometimes she asks for services and sometimes I'm really busy but she gets soooo frustrated and then starts threatening me (""you can't see your boyfriend"" or ""you'll start paying rent""). And then she says I always complain but that is not true. I often help without complaining and whenever she goes do the grocery and comes back and I'm in the middle of studying, she expects me to come help right away. Maybe that's just me being insensitive or selfish, I don't know. This summer, she forced me to take two weeks off work so I could watch the dog while they go on a camping trip yet I have things to pay. Most of the time, I feel like my life doesn't matter to her and that I need to drop everything to do whatever she wants me to do.
 
The other day, I said I was going to the corner store to get something for my boyfriend because he was picking me up in less than an hour and she wanted me to grab milk (a specific brand) and juice. The had juice but not the milk she wanted. So when I got back with the juice but not the milk, she got mad at me and didn't believe that they didn't carry it and then she called the store to verify if it was true. Then she wanted me to go find the milk, but my boyfriend got here so she told me : never mind. I then leave with my boyfriend and we were 15 minutes away from home and my mom called me demanding to have the milk right away or then my boyfriend wasn't allowed to come over no more. So we had to make a detour, find a store and then give her the milk meanwhile we were late to the place we were going.
 
We do fight a lot, my mom and I. When we both have an opinion, we both stick with it. Whenever we fight, there's been a lot of times where she says she doesn't know why she gets so mad at me compared to my siblings but it's just something about me that pisses her off immediately whenever I do something. My dad used to have the same effect on her. Growing up, she compared me a lot to my dad, said I was destroying our relationship, etc. It hurts a lot because I never considered myself as a bad person and I know I have my flaws but I really don't know what I do wrong to the point I feel like she hates me. She hates my dad so much and I didn't like him either because of the stuff she said when I grew up. No, he isn't the best dad, was never really there, was a bit manipulative too and also an alcoholic and depressed. But when your mom starts comparing you to your dad and says you're just like him, the first thing that comes in mind is : she hates me.
 
She hates my dad and she says I'm just like him so that must mean she hates me. Then she figured out the reason why she gets so mad at me easily is probably related to the fact, I'm like my dad or can act like him. She says I play mind-games, just like him. I never understood what I do that is considered mind-games. All I know is that I have a big problem at expressing myself and my emotions so sometimes I can defensive or distant.
 
Her and my stepdad told me a few times that they felt bad for whoever marrying me later on in life and hoped that I don't find anyone.
 
Whenever we fight, she always wins because she'll ""manipulate"" me in someways. She's going to threaten me on stuff she knows I can't control so I apologize and change my attitude. Ex: I'm going to kick you out by the end of university...
 
Sometimes my mom says she doesn't mean that stuff but when it's repetitive, it must be because somewhere in your head, you're thinking about it. At this point, I don't know who to talk to because most of my conversations with her are going to turn against me.

And then my boyfriend is an amazing person and he didn't have it in easy with his dad but sometimes he has a bad attitude (never been abusive) and he is gets annoyed with stuff easily but he's more independent than me and I don't understand why I'm dependent. I didn't think I was but I overthink the worse all the time. We never text and the only time we talk is when he does on break of after work and sometimes he only calls me at 7pm. I know I never developed a secure relationship with my mom nor my dad. When I grew up, my dad would sometimes not pick me up on days he was supposed to. Sometimes he wouldn't talk to me for weeks. My mom, on the other hand, would always threaten me to kick me out and make ne move to my dad's. It sucks because I've realized it affects my relationship and I have trouble dealing with that. 
 
Sometimes I start wondering, maybe I am a bad person.
I just feel like a failure and that I can't do anything right. I can't handle this. I thought I could.

I wish I could consult but I got not enough money to pay 200$ per session and can't access free services because the wait is too long and my university sucks at offering help."
1815,have no reasons left,Im borderline (bpd) and i was dumped by someone i loved more than anything. I am so empty and sad. The pain of my breakdowns is getting to me and i cant keep doing this. The pain is so severe that i dont want to wake up anymore. I feel like i dont have a reason left to either. I am giving up.
1816,Please help,"I don't know why I'm writing this but I just want to talk to someone, anyone. I have no idea what to do anymore.

The last thing I've heard from my mother was ""why don't you just die?"" and that was almost 3 years ago. My life has always been shit but I'm at an all time low right now, the girl who saved my life and gave it meaning and made it something worth waking up to every morning left me for someone else. After she saved me from my parent's abuse and my own self destructive ways, after making me feel wanted and loved, after making me feel like someone actually gives a fuck about me, after everything we've been through. I finally had dreams and aspirations, I've been trying my hardest in everything for her sake, I tried my fucking best. What hurts the most is the fact that she left me with no remorse, she knows me better than anyone, she knows how weak I am, I didn't want pity but the fact the she just left without showing any concern for me as if we never happened just hurts too fucking much. If I didn't meet her I would've already been dead, but I really fucking wish I never met her, this hurts way more than the abuse I've received and the loneliness before I met her. After a failed attempt last week, I'm contemplating on trying again.

If you come across this by any chance, Moni, I just wanna say thank you for making me feel happiness even just for a short amount of time. Even after what you did I still love you, I love you so much."
1817,I can’t do this anymore,"Never been happy with my life. At 17 I almost killed myself. Then i met the most amazing girl of my life who helped me get back on track and become a better person mentally and such. Yesterday out of the blue, she said she does not love me anymore and wants no part of me. I’m destroyed, confused, and lonely again. I keep on looking at pictures of nature thinking if this is what would happen in the next life, a much happier one with a fresh start. Idk i’m just rambling at this point. I think i’m going to give her the present that i’ve bought her and write one last note before I make my decision tonight. Bye for now."
1818,"DAE feel a perpetual, mental state of nothing?","This might sound strange but, for many years now, I haven't really 'slept'. Not the way normal people do. I don't rest. I close my eyes (hoping to die perusal) and open them again with no change whatsoever. It feels like my battery is constantly at zero. I'm not physically tired, only mentally I guess.

Just wanted to know if anyone is/was going though the same thing and if there's a way out of this (besides the obvious).

Thanks for reading everyone and hope it's going better for you all!"
1819,I want end everything. Im so confused.,"I feel like crap everything in my life is falling apart i have no friends to talk to,my parents dont care about me and  my dad lives in the other side of the country for work reasons and i live here with my mum and i hate it i hate my mother i just found out she's having an affair with some guy which she says is her 'cousin' or some shit like that and my dad doesn't know about this but im not planning on telling him this, it's just so confusing i really dont know what to do im just 15 and i hate this all i cant talk to anybody about my feelings because they will think im a lunatic, i cry everytime i feel like nobody understands me i only can post this on the internet thinking people will get me,i feel like killing myself so this pain can end im stupid i do horrible in school and im really stupid, i had this fellings with me since i was like 12 i tried killing myself by overdosing but that didnt work and know i just want end it all i really dont know what to do."
1820,Let us pray,I keep asking God to kill me.  Maybe he'll hear my prayer today if a bunch of yous pray he kills me too.   Thanks.
1821,I despise myself for sometimes wishing the things that keep me alive to just disappear.,"I am exhausted to the core of my being. Every is just constant crying and silent pain. The only reason I haven't actively tried to kill myself again is because of my dogs. They save me everyday and I fear they day they will be gone. But in the lowest points of my life I wish they're just gone so I can just go as well. This year has been one mess up to another; lost job, cheating ex, people who constantly come in my life and leave as soon as they get better themselves. I'm tired of being left behind, tired of waking up to nothing, tired of crying, tired of having this pain that never goes away. The holiday season is just enforcing my loneliness and my bitterness over people who are merrily spending it with their love ones and I hate myself for feeling like this. I just want to go home, wherever home is."
1822,Suicidal,I don't Understand why am I alive.. just feel like my life is waste of oxygen and every other thing.....
1823,"Why, when there's no point","I feel like no subjective value will ever be enough to fill the void that is my meaningless existence. What's the point of experiencing life if my joy will just end and my suffering has no objective value? I feel this way because I've been trying for years to find answers, to find relief from my depression, and neither searches have been fruitful. I think I'm just gonna get high one last time before taking a bunch of caffeine pills."
1824,Not everyone wants to die,"I always forget it’s unusual to want to die constantly. To be forming a new plan to kill yourself every week. To say when literally anything inconvenient happens, “fucking idiot, why don’t you die?” It just seems so normal to me at this point. And then I hear people say stuff like “oh yeah I used to be depressed, and I actually thought about suicide a few times but I realized my family loves me and blah blah blah...” like it’s a big deal to them. Well I want to die every. Single. Day. It is every thought, every Google search, every part of me. And somehow, I just assume it’s like that for everyone else, because it’s so strong for me. But it’s not. Most people want to live. I just... don’t."
1825,My parents are my only reasons when I try to convince myself not to do it anymore.,Life consists of peeks and vallies. The idea of ending one's life usually only comes into one's mind when you're in your lowest moments. And when the means to cope are outweighed by the desire to give up. I'm not going to make it up the next peek. I'm scared of who I'll hurt. But I give up
1826,I can't take this anymore,"I keep crying over and over again. I hate living like this, I just want to be happy. This is too much for me and I don't know how to get over the reocurring suicidal thoughts. I'm just scared."
1827,Guilt is slowly seeping out if my veins...,"The guilt and paperwork I still need to file was keeping me alive but I am suddenly feeling (or not feeling) like I care about anything or anyone and the paperwork can go to hell, it will no longer be my business... My therapist and psychiatrist don’t give a shit beyond getting paid and peace of mind, so I am pre-paying them so *I* can have peace of mind without feeling like I owe any debts. Which I don’t. I have never been more sure and ready to make this happen and never cared less about the consequences and reactions of other people... I’ve reached out to both my therapist and psych and got zero response. It’s a sign. Amd a matter of time. The sooner the better."
1828,Help...I hate myself so much and I cant do this anymore,"I dont know what to say...ive been researching ways to off myself, but all of them are kinda hard to pull off. Let me explain. 

My preferred method is jumping. I would prefer to from a building, but bridges will do. Buildings near me arent an option because it'll traumatize the people who may see me jump, see me dead, and also major inconvenience for students at my uni. Unfortunately george washington bridge now has high barriers and netting set up so thats not an option. Other bridges in area are not accessible by pedestrians. The ones that are pedestrian accessible have a decent protective barrier to scale and I dont think I can do it fast enough without getting caught. I might maybe try worst case... other bridges closer are too small to guarantee death. I am not risking a failed attempt.

Pills? At my dorm, I do not have enough of any sort to do the job for sure. I would rather be dead than alive with consequences after a failed attempt. I could buy stuff though? I am looking into this. Or i might go home and get enough to do the job in my dorm. I have a single so no one to really traumatize too badly. 

I am not into hanging and i do not think i even have string or rope to do it. Also not sure of calculation for distances and all. Slitting my wrist? I do not have a knife and kinda sounds like not my thing. 

Any suggestions? Yeah...I am tired and I do not think I can live with myself any longer. My hatred for myself is increasing and I do not know how to get professional help. I know i have people who care about me .but its a long story. I am getting tired of it, but I like living so much. I have so much I want to do, but I dont think I have it in me to keep going for that."
1829,I'm done with living,"I've been an outcast for most of my life. All my life I just wanted someone to care about me. I talked to about 200 or so people online and I've always got my hopes up. I've been to the hospital because of being ghosted. I don't believe in reincarnation, I saw people that have been murdered. I just don't believe in it. We don't live in a 'simulation.' I met a dude at the hospital for my suicide attempt that told me to not meet freaks online. I don't believe in reincarnation, the after life. None of that. Most of the people you meet online are like the devil's incarnate. It's not me, it's you. I'm killing myself like my online friend did because everything is pointless. I always thought he killed himself because of me but I guess he realized everything is pointless too. I've been beat, bruised, and most of the time I just sleep in my room all day. I just wanted someone to love me. I'm buying Everclear for my 21st. I made my mind up."
1830,To next life.,"You, shall be a brave, confident aspie that can handle with harassment, bullying, taunting, provoking and teasing, even fighting back against injustice and bully as a shepherd, and, as Batman.

1838,My Parents Deserve To Die,"My parents ruined my life and they deserve to die for it. I have no empathy towards them and I would feel absolutely no mercy, pity, or remorse if they were burned alive. It's time for me to end my life. They need to take responsibility for their actions. They are pathetic, disgraceful people and I would take everything they have just for myself because they don't deserve any of it. By virtue of them being Americans and raising me in the US which is the worst country in the developed world and a disgraceful country, they've already committed a crime. It's time for things to be fixed and they are complete sociopaths that deserve to die. Burn in hell!"

This is a delayed/scheduled post, mainly because I don't want to be convinced to not do the act.Usually, I resent the statement that people who commit suicide are cowards, but that probably applies to me right now. The thing is, I'm not depressed, it's purely suicidal-ness. I don't want myself to exist, it's more trouble than it's worth. And, it's in combination of beliefs, like the whole, ""life is temporary,"" speel. And, I have it planned in whole, such as; delayed messages to police department, warning signs, and so forth.

1842,It economically doesnt make sense to be alive,"I don't want anything out of life. There's nothing worth living for. 

I've been working to move out lately and crunching the numbers of expenses and its just too much work for zero benefit. The work required for nothing that I value just doesn't add up. 

The things that feel good like food, drugs, and alcohol kill you. Half the stuff that feels good is illegal or some scheme to trick you out of money. Our political leaders are corrupt, the rich get away with everything when we go to jail if we can't pay child support or parking tickets. Everyone only cares about themselves and instant gratification. We spend money on dates and cars (guys) makeup and clothes (ladies) for people who we'll forget about or hate eventually. And all the people who do care are silenced or die too young. 

We are slaves to money to live these meaningless lives, it really just makes more sense for us to die if we can't go on. At least then we have a choice. 

I just really can't understand what there is to live for that justifies slaving away everyday."
1843,I'll likely not last the year,"My spirit has finally been broken. I'm not even sure what happened or how it came to pass. It just did. I no longer fear death. I no longer think ""what about the things I'll miss if I go now."" Now i just want to go. I've lost any and all hope for a better future going further. When i look at what's coming all i see is a dark road getting darker. I keep trying to improve, keep trying to learn and correct my mistakes but it blows up in my face every time. I go to therapy, take meds, exercise, journal, make friends. But then it dawned on me: none of it is worth it. Nothing, for me, makes life worth living. And that is the most miserable situation one can find themselves in.

I have no one to live for one. I have no great cause to champion. I have no project i need to see to completion. I am just bumbling through life trying to merely get at a state of self sufficiency. But when I think about that, I think then what? Just go to work, come back, play more video games and sleep? Forever? This might be fine if I had something or someone to dedicate my life too, a passion or a love interest but I don't have either. Writing is the close to a passion i have and that's not nearly strong enough to keep me here and because I'm schizoid I'm basically incapable of forming relationships. I don't ever connect to others, they're all just aquaintences.

What's worst of all? For the first time since maybe high school I'm actually happy. Happy that i may be putting an end to all this soon. This is what makes me happy, the idea of my life finally reaching its conclusion. I just can't deal with it all anymore. Dysphoria, PTSD, my eating disorder. My entire life has been dominated by anxiety and mental anguish that i struggle every day to keep a lid on. And every day it gets hard to see the point in it all. I suffer simply to suffer for the next day and the one after. And that's hardly life at all.  I'm planning on taking a road trip. See some things I've always wanted to see. Camp some. And when i reach my final destination that'll probably be it. I can't fight anymore. Every year the life from my drains just a little more. I have been dealing with my ED and PTSD since I was 12 and I'm near 24 now. I just... I can't do this forever. I can't. It is a night and day struggle not to just completely fall apart at the seams. And the more years i get under my belt the more recovery just looks like nothing but a fantasy.

I hate that it has come to this. I didn't want to be here. I don't want to inflict the horrid mental anguish that suicide causes on the ones close to me. But I just don't have it in me anymore. I'm taking the year to make sure my affairs are in order. Make amends, do a bucket list that sort of thing. But after that... after that I don't think I'll have much reason left. I'm so sorry. I really wish i could just keep chugging along. But even i have a point where it's too much. Even i have a breaking point."
1844,I have to somehow survive this until after christmas,"I don't want to hurt my parents, my family. If I would kill myself it would hurt them so much. But I just can't do this anymore. I'm just waiting for me to die naturally or by an accident but it just won't happen. I'm 21 and who knows I'll live for another 60 years. If I decide to kill myself it has to be after christmas, I just can't ruin christmas for my family. The only reason I'm still alive is because I don't want to hurt my parents, sister, family, friends.

I just can't live with things I've done before. The remorse and guilt is eating me up inside. I had sex with my then-girlfriend after she asked me if I wanted sex and she unenthusiastically told me she wanted as well. She has BPD and our relationship was becoming very unhealthy for a few months. She projected her irrational fears onto me, got mad at me for every small thing and we had arguments a lot. We just had a fight and she was still looking angry/sad. I just accepted it. I knew she looked unenthusiastic, not moving and staying silent. That she was most likely not into it. That she had a history of dissociating during sex and thinking about past traumatic experiences. That she had a lot of irrational fears of me leaving her if I wouldn't get enough sex because of experiences with her past exes. Somehow I convinced myself that since she initiated she knew what she was doing. That it was not illegal or anything since there was consent. That it did not necessarily mean she was dissociating, but could also mean that she was just angry about the fight. But was I really sure about that? My thought process was so flawed. If she says no or stop I will stop, I told myself. I should have just stopped or not engaged in the first place. The next day she told me in tears that she did not like what I did. She forgave me the same day however, but I don't know if that's because she meant it or because she just wanted me to stay with her since she had no one else. I broke up with her not long after since it became all too much for me. The relationship sucked and now this happened. I found it hypocritical to ask me for sex, and then not tell me you actually did not want it until the day after. It was the final straw. During the break-up she even admitted that she sometimes manipulated me into getting angry to see how far I would go, for her to get confirmation that I truly loved her. I can't bear living in a reality where I've possibly violated someone. It's disgusting. She was the girl I loved and did everything for, always put her first. I never wanted to hurt her. And then I make a selfish, careless decision. It didn't dawn upon me what I did until 2 years after. But now that I know better I can't live with myself anymore. I did something that I've always been absolutely disgusted at. Something that never crossed my mind, that I've never even had the slightest urge to do.

Please, please, everyone, only engage in sex if it's initiated enthusiastically. Most likely the other party is only doing it to please you and don't want it themselves. It's possible for people to freeze up during such things. No one should go through that. It's the best for both parties to not engage in it. You don't want to feel as if you've violated/traumatized someone. I can't live with it."
1845,done,"im so desperate to die at this point

i will probably stab myself since i dont have anything else

im sorry"
1846,I cant do today,I cant deal with all the assholes or the bullshit I have to do. Im thinking of just going for the knife idgaf anymore life is so painful and not worth it.
1847,I tie nooses to cope,I already attempted to hang myself but it failed. Why can't I just leave??
1848,"I need help, fast","Okay so I don’t know where to post this and honestly I don’t know how much time I have. 

So I was bored tonight and decided to go on Omegle and chat to people. I matched with this one guy and after a casual hi he told me that he’s not doing well. I instantly went into panic mode and asked if he was suicidal. He said yes. I asked him when we was planning on doing it and he said after Christmas. I started a conversation and gave him the crisis help line. We continued talking and through giving made up information about myself, I was able to get his first name, age, and what state he lived in. I told him that I was hungry and asked him if there was any family owned restaurants that he likes near him so I could pinpoint his exact town. 

Now I have his full name, age, and town of residence. I know it sounds creepy but I wanna help him. What should I do?"
1849,hey how’s your day,im very mad at everything and i kinda wanna die
1850,I’m alone and suicidal,Hey everyone. I’ve been depressed and suicidal for over 5 years now and not only do i want the pain to stop but i want my whole life to stop. my days are always horrible and i had an attempt 3 years ago and i wish i died then bc i have nothing good happen so there’s nothing to live for. everyone says it’ll get better but when my life genuinely sucks i don’t think it will. i don’t want people’s pity i just want to die.
1851,"When I finally felt happy and at peace, I tried to end it all.","For months I have planned everything. I traveled alone to Japan (summer 2018) to do things I love (hiking and anime stuff) before ending it all by entering the suicide forest and never come back out again. On my last day in Japan was a trip to the forest. I felt that I was very much at peace. It was a different kind of ""peace""... it scares me when I think about that moment now. I felt relieved of everything and I was ready to die. I accepted the kind of life I had and that was it for me. It was time for me to go. Nothing much to do. No point in living. I was happy. I was at peace. And now obviously, Im still here because I changed my mind.

But I fear that the day would come again when I could have that ""peace"" and finally kill myself. I dont know if you understand what Im saying. The recent death of my old beloved cat made everything worse for me. Im having suicidal thoughts everyday."
1852,My GPA (2.53 after 3 semesters) is too low for gradschool and all I want to do is to put a nice warm bullet into my skull," 

Got recently got banned from [r/ausguns](https://www.reddit.com/r/ausguns/) for saying I want to commit suicide in an Australian shooting range but whatever, I am going to do it anyway like a man, either that or sell all my belongings and book a one way ticket to Hong Kong (got some family members there so might as well try to help them against the oppression there).

Just failed my calculus 2 final, (covering laplace, vector calculus, and complex calculus) and just feeling hopeless (my university requires students to pass the final to pass the course). My 2.53 on a scale of 4 GPA (4.429 on a scale of 7) after 3 semesters of study means I will never get to grad school. I am Australian so grad school is an nonnegotiable necessity for me to work in the industry I want to which happens to be space systems as I need an EB-2 visa (which requires a postgraduate degree) to get into the US as a US person. Well, it's either that or making a space related startup from scratch which is even harder than grad school. 

Now my life has no meaning whatsoever and I'm just sitting here listening to some depressing music.

To make things worse, I was once considered pretty bright in elementary and high school (graduated 91.45 percentile from high school). I worked all my life to try to reach this goal but now it's just gone to shit in two hours. Guessing I really did fail the 10 year challenge.

TL;DR: All my entire life's work and dreams gone in a matter of two hours."
1853,"my friend is suicidal, and i refused to help her. was that wrong of me?","  

I had a friend who I got really close to in the ninth grade. She was the type of person to lie about a lot of things - for example, she was well-known for self-harming, although in multiple instances she had coloured her skin with red ink to make it look blood, etc. However, I wanted to be her friend anyway, because I had known her for a while and I hated that she was obviously in pain, even if she was lying about her symptoms sometimes.

Throughout the course of our friendship, we confided in each other things that we never told anybody. 

During our ninth grade final exams, she took me into another classroom and confessed that she had tried to commit suicide twice in the past month, but the attempts didn't work. I was heartbroken, and I told her so, cried for her and begged her to call me if she felt like doing this ever again. She agreed, and she said, “You’re the only reason I’m living right now. You’re saving my life.”

A week later, our summer holidays began. During this summer, she stopped talking to me. I would text her and call her to check up on her, but she left me on read and ignored the missed calls. In school, she would walk away when I would approach her, or have a max two minute conversation with me, etc. After a while, I got the hint and stepped away. For weeks, I wondered if I was the one at fault, but she later came up to me and apologized, saying, ""I'm going through something, and I knew if I spoke to you I would spill everything, which I didn't want to do. I won't ignore you again."" And so, of course, I forgave her.  But she did the same thing. Walked away, looked away, acted like I was a stranger. Now around this time my mental health was really bad - I was perpetually tired, always feeling helpless, and for the large part of that year I was suicidal, and I had nobody to talk to. It was routine for me to break down and want to talk to someone, especiallyher, but she just wasn't there. The more time passed, the harder it became for me to reach out for help, and the more hopeless I felt. I would usually ask her for help, but by that time she was an actual stranger to me. So the whole year goes by like that, right, and the summer comes and goes, and new year comes in, and I make new friends who I get really close to. My mental health is finally getting better, until she shows up.

She calls me up sometime in October, crying, accusing me of not being there for her at all. She said it was horrible that the one reason she was living didn’t care about her at all, and that she was really struggling and had no reason to live. I apologize to her, and say I’ll do better. This is where I’m stumped, though, because I haven’t had a full conversation with her for at least a year and a half or something, and I don’t know who she is anymore. 

She meets me in school the next day, and tells me to forget about the phone call, because she will never mean to me what I mean to her (i.e. she will never be the reason I am living, like I am the reason for her), and she’s not okay with that. She gives me no room to argue, and says that she doesn’t want to speak to me anymore, unless it’s to do with work. 

A month later, she drags me into an empty classroom, and says, “I refuse to have you be the reason I live and die. You’re responsible for my life now, you’re responsible for whether I live or die. I don’t care whether that’s right or wrong.” I nod and agree, because like she said, whether it’s the right or wrong thing do to, this is a life-or-death situation. 

But I walk up to her the next day and say that I can’t and will not be responsible for her life, because I had realized that I would not be able to save her. I was trying to be strong for myself, and I felt like I didn't have the energy to be strong for someone else. Also I was kind of done with her bullshit, however bad that sounds. She nods and says she understands.

Later on in the school year, she comes to me crying, saying she needs me. I take her to the bathroom so she can feel better and talk to me freely, and I tell her she needs professional help because she can’t keep living like this. She leaves me with, “Whatever. We both know this is your fault.”

So, reddit, is she right? Is her mental state my fault?"
1854,Proud of myself,"I’m proud of myself. Last night I had a really shitty night. I normally cope by cutting, but I didn’t cut last night."
1855,Scared of myself,"Hi all. OSDD here. I'm usually pretty in control, and when I'm triggered into a different part, I can usually regain control, or at least after I'm aware of what happened. I have a part (18) who is suicidal and full of hopelessness and despair. Recently I was triggered, and switched, and even though I kept trying to pull myself back to the front, 18 is too strong, and kept taking control. There's only so much I can do. I'm not normally depressed or suicidal. 18 really believes the only way to be free is to be dead. When she's in control I'm not thinking ""oh I'll call a helpline"", I cover every thing up, and try to end my life. Recently she was triggered out, and I although I think she's safely settled again, I'm afraid. I don't want to die. But there is nothing anyone can do to stop me if she takes control. I spoke to my psychologist about this recently, and said ""what can anyone do?!! If they send me to the hospital I will say 'oh no, I would never kill myself, I have my daughter to live for, I could never do that to her. If I feel like these thoughts are getting overwhelming I will call a friend, and if I feel like I can't keep myself safe from acting on these urges, I will call an ambulance or come to the hospital.' but that would be a LIE. If that part is in control there is no help seeking. Every single time I have tried to end my life, I have given it my best shot, and it hasn't worked. There hasn't been me taking an overdose and then calling an ambulance. When 18 is in control, I want to die""

So what is the answer? Just hope like hell I can hold enough ground in the tug of war until she settles? I don't want to die, not at all. I want to live! I want a future. But if 18 takes over, I might not survive another one of her attempts."
1856,I’ve become so empty I want to be invisible,Invisible beyond existence where I don’t want to see anyone. This world is all about being fake and I don’t want to be fake. I’m tired of pretending. Tired of pretending to be confident when I’m not. Tired of laughing when I’m sad. Tired of pretending everything is okay when it’s not. Tired of life when I’m dead inside. I don’t belong in the world and world doesn’t like me anyway so adios mi amigos
1857,i just want to be reborn,"honestly, if i had any past lives i think they were also hard. but my life is full of constant worrying, stress and pain everyday. I progressively hate people around me each day, and distance myself from my friends because I fear I might hurt them. I'm the type of person to hold my feelings in, until someone asks about it. That's why the question: ""are you okay?"" always triggers me and makes me cry, I say I am, but deep down everyone knows I'm not. I don't feel like eating anymore and I've been visibly pale and thin. Each day I feel like is a calling for suicide, and when I look back in the past I can finally see why: I was mistreated by people around me.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it would be a surprise for everyone that I die of suicide, most would think I would die from an illness."
1858,I'm so I'm so im so I'm so....,"To Tara Condell, Christine Woo, Laura Vanessa Nunes, Christine Woo, Lu Chang Wang, Sylvia Plath, Lucy Gordon, Abraham K Biggs, Anne Sexxton, Virginia Wolfe, Chester Bennington, Robin Williams, Lee Thompson Young. I'm so im so I'm so im so proud of you!!! I love you all."
1859,I'm going to kill myself,"I've spent the past 10 years trying to get my life under control. I've put in thousands of hours of effort studying and - later - working. But things just never turn out well. When I was in school, I performed well above average and earned an ""in demand"" degree, but with the collapse in '07/08 things just never took off. Then I had a boss who would take advantage of and exploit his clients. Everyone else I know with my qualifications has done better, had more fulfilling careers, and generally seem to be living lives worth living. But I'm trapped in a nothing place. 

Plus two serious illnesses have disrupted me at critical periods in my life, throwing my future into question. In one instance, it actually cost me the job of my dreams and half a year of my literal memories, to the point I can't recall anything from that time. In another, more recent instance, it could easily set me back a year. 

Nothing has turned out how I wanted it to, or even remotely close to what it could have been. I always end up in the worst possible situation, with the worst possible outcomes, whether I put 110% into something or don't try at all. 

I can't really bear with it anymore. The incoming holidays are just a massive fucking reminder of how completely I've failed as a person to do anything. I'm in my 30s with nothing to show, just a litany of might-have-beens and failures in my wake. I even decided to go back to school to try and restart, but there's a good chance what I want to do will take at least a year longer than I need it to, and I just wonder what's the point? 

Why bother living if life is never enjoyable? Why bother living when nothing that matters to you turns out even slightly like how you want it? 

My girlfriend doesn't understand either. But she lucked into the job of her dreams 7 years ago. She tells me things like ""keep pushing forward,"" and ""don't give up,"" but all of her advice comes from a place where she hasn't had to deal with a decade of constant setbacks and failures. I don't resent her success, but I do resent the platitudes. 

Or maybe I just am not likable. I don't know. I can't even remotely care anymore. The last time I felt anything other than despair was... 5 or 6 years ago. I remember the optimism from back then, the sense that things could turn out well. If I'd known then what I know now, I would never have bothered. 

So I've decided to kill myself. If my current objective doesn't turn out (and it needs to, or I lose time I don't feel I have to spare), then I'm going to smuggle a gun into my building and blow my brains out. That seems like the surest way to end it all."

I like to think I'm not a bad person, but I've come to the blunt conclusion in my head that I am. I want to kill my ex boyfriend for leaving, even though I chose to leave him first. I left but I still loved him because I don't believe that I am worthy of love and I should leave before I hurt him even more. That was what I told myself in my head, anyway, but he was hurting for awhile after I did it, and I just shrugged him off. Now he is actually with someone else and I am struggling to decide if I should kill myself or him. Sometimes I get so angry that I fantasize about killing him. I'm a selfish, deluded sociopath and I left University because I can't handle life anymore after he left. It was a stupid decision, just like all the other stupid decisions I make because now I just lay around doing nothing all night, sleeping 12 hours a day, barely eating, and fantasizing about killing my ex or myself. I have been cutting my breasts too because I hate them, I wish I could cut them off. I have serious issues going on in my head, and after sleepless nights I get very upset, I took a permanent marker and wrote all sorts of crap all over my bedroom walls while listening to Mansion by NF on repeat. I push everyone away because I don't believe I deserve them, and then I act like it's their fault when really it's all my own doing. I miss my ex but I never deserved him in the first place.

1868,I'm destined to be a fuck up and I want to be done with this so badly,"Basically I'm a complete piece of garbage who can't make a good decision to save his life (literally).
I steal from Walmart out of boredom just to feel some sort of excitement in life and tonight it got me chased by cops and tased. 
I abuse drugs to try and feel something other than complete nothingness. 
I'm just sad. .  A lot. 
My mom and I fought constantly my entire life (now 25) and during the last 5 months of her life I was finally able to act decent towards her and be the kid she loved. I know I made her life hell and I don't even know why. I hated everything and everyone that tried to help. I think I blamed her for my problems especially after finding out in adopted. I felt like I was lied to my whole life and any argument we ever had made me look back and think (oh, we argued because I'm not hers. She doesn't actually love me she just deals with me)
I was fucking stupid. She was my best friend in the entire world and I was too much of a stupid brat to just love her back and be happy. I miss her every single day and I still feel like I'm the reason she's gone. The stress had to have done awful things for her and to top it all off? I was too busy getting fucked up to take her death seriously. I just figured it was another scare and she'd be back tomorrow. No. She fucking died while I was at home completely wrecked on cough medicine and watching TV. She probably died thinking I could give a shit less.

Now tonight I just keep looking at my severely destroyed arms after slamming the pavement once the taser hit me. I have 3 new charges that I'm being hit with, I'm broke and behind on rent, I got my amazing girlfriend's car impounded and I just. . I've had enough. 

Why the FUCK can't I be normal???? Why can't I just fucking grow up and stop doing stupid shit. Why can't I just be fucking happy. I want it so badly and no matter how hard I try I ALWAYS go back into my shitty ways. 
My girlfriend doesn't deserve this. She's an absolute angel trying to fight her own sad demons and all I do is add stress to her life.
Sure, she'll be sad when I'm gone but she'll eventually realize it's for the best. She'll finally be able to move on, she'll forget the last 9 years ever happened and she'll finally be with someone who she deserves and be happy. 

I'm certain my dad will be happy. He won't have to worry about his kid fucking up again and having to bail him out.  He'll stop stressing over the next phone call he gets about how I wasn't able to make rent because I can't keep a fucking job. 

I don't exist to my siblings but hey, atleast they won't have to hear about how their shit brother got arrested again am I right? 


The only thing at this point that brings me any Joy is the idea that it'll all be over soon. The police fucked up HARD letting me go to the hospital. Of course I'd promise to turn myself in. Otherwise I'm stuck in jail. Now I can finally grow the balls I've needed to do this shit and move on. 

This isn't a cry for help. More of a ""final thoughts"" post.


Also, to my longest lasting friend, Erik.  Fuck you. You were never really my friend. You manipulated me for years and guilt tripped me into doing shit for you because you KNEW you were the only friend I had. You ALWAYS made sure that I spent money on you if we hung out. You ALWAYS made me buy you drugs even when I was trying to quit. I have no fucking clue why I let you wreck me like that. You permanently scarred me for life into being afraid of connection. Any time I felt like I could trust you, you threw piss blankets on me in my sleep or made your dogs attack me. Fuck you. 


Thanks for letting me air this all out reddit. There's much more but I'm tired of typing. Bye"
1869,I'm only living because I have things and people I care about,"I'm only living for my parents and friends whom I care about as well as things I give a damn about such as traveling and subtle passions like casual gaming and hobby photography. Many of my wishes are still unfulfilled (I still want to travel to the US and Japan before I die). But other than these I don't really see the point of living and struggling till old age slogging for money and dealing with people's bullshit in a society that could give less of a damn about you and one that is becoming worse and worse both physically and morally especially with the rise of unfettered capitalism.

Once my parents are gone and I have fulfilled most if not all of my wishes I will probably opt to check out with euthanasia at a rough estimate of age 40 max. Meanwhile I'm going to try my best to enjoy every moment and fulfil my wishes before this age that I have set for myself to check out."
1870,have you thought of hiring a hit man?,Is it worth it? Is that something real or is it something you only see on the movies
1871,Failure at 39,"Title says it all, but I'll explain.

I'm 39 years old. I live at home with my parents. I've never lived on my own, except for a short stint in college, which I'll get to.

I have no friends to call and hang out with. Usually when I go places it's alone unless my family goes with me. I normally hate being around large groups of people. Not because of them, but because I hate myself because I don't fit in and always feel like a loser.

I have no job. I haven't had one in 10 years. I had jobs in my 20's, but I never really liked them. I hate the thought of expending the effort to get one, knowing that I'll just get tired of it and quit. I did start driving for uber a couple months ago. I did it for 5 weeks full time before I got burned out. Now for money I go to the plasma center if I feel like it and I also play poker in the LA cardrooms. But I'm not too good.

I've never had a girlfriend. Never even held one's hand, except for a stripper who walked me to the VIP room because I was going to pay her $150. I know the reason for this is that I'm one of the ugliest fucks you'll ever see. In high school, the only time girls would talk to me is to ask who my good looking friend was going to prom with. I once hung out with 2 guy friends and 3 girls. One of the girls took one of my friends into a room and did god knows what. The other 2 were all over my other friend while i sat there just wanting to be anywhere else. My sister's friends have openly wanted to bang two of my brothers, but wouldn't come near me. I've been to clubs and girls would walk right up to my friend and ignore me. One night he even took one back to the hotel and banged her in the bed next to me. I put my face up on reddit's amiugly, and got ripped apart pretty brutally. I've looked at other posts on that thread, and most of the comments are actually pretty nice. That one still hurts.

I couldn't go to college straight after high school, because if anything high school taught me what a loser i am. When I was 37, I got the notion that I should go to college and get a job and move out before I turn 40. So I finished some transfer classes and went to UCSB. For one quarter. The classes were hard and I just didn't care to pass them. There was just no point.

In college I met another older student. She was 30. We hung out a lot. She was a former model and definitely had some depression issues like me. I tried to tell her that I liked her, but she clearly didn't want anything like that. I know just from the way she talked that if I was better looking, things would have happened.

I've been suicidal since I was 13. If I could go back now and talk to that scared little kid in the bathtub, I'd tell him to just please do it. It's not gonna get better. I know I'll feel the same way when I'm 60. I've tried several times since I was 30, and one of these days I'm gonna get it right.

I'm ready to go now. Sorry for the long post, and I wish each and every one of you the very best."
1873,It's feeling like the logical destination for all of my decisions up until this point,"I'm not averse to suicide from a moral, ethical, or religious standpoint. It's your body to do with as you wish. Morally, I don't give a shit. I'm not directly hurting anyone, so it's really none of anyone's business. Ethically, same reason. Ethics are taught and I've never had much regard for the standards of society; and I'm not religious at all. I don't believe in God, gods, or spirits. Not ghosts, fate, destiny, or luck. I just understand what happens happens because of probability and choices we make, and I've made a lot of stupid choices.  

  

Most recently, I decided to take a semester off from the University of North Carolina (I'm a Junior) to go spend time in rural Idaho, meeting my biological father for the first time (I'm 30), all my siblings I didn't know existed, and working at his restaurant. It's been an amazing experience, and I've learned absolutely so much, but in doing so I fucked myself.   

I was here for a few months when I learned I was nearing the end of my student loan grace period. Now I couldn't just up and leave. I had nothing in North Carolina. My wife and I lived with my parents because we were both going to school full time. We came out here, we have our own apartment, full-time employment that we enjoy, and access to recreational marijuana only 5 miles down the road in Washington. So I ignored it.  

  

Fast forward to today, I get an email that I have to start paying back my student loans, $230 a month that I can't afford with rent and things, plus I find out that I can't even transfer my transcripts from UNC because I owe them for a parking ticket I got a year ago, so even if I wanted to attend the University of Idaho, I can't. On top of all of that, even if I could get my transcripts transferred, I haven't been an Idaho resident long enough to go to college here. I took just long enough of a break to fuck myself over big time.  



Besides all the external problems, I've been noticing that time passes by a lot faster than it used to. My back hurts, my feet and ankles hurt all the time, I'm just not as handsome or in as good of shape as I once was. Age has finally started catching up to me and with it came the realization that I'm actually aging. My wife says, ""Shut up, you're cute"" and it makes me laugh and feels nice and all, but does little to actually change my opinion. With age comes wisdom and I feel like I'm wise enough now to know that it's not going to get any better. I've been a monumental fuck-up for so long that I'm down to my last few chances to not end up as a sponge just living off of the generosity of family members.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then, on top of all of that, as much as I want to just rage against the dying of the light, it feels like too much effort. Maybe it's my personality type, maybe it's my Bipolar Disorder diagnosis (fun times) and the possible BPD diagnosis my doctor was hinting at before I left NC. I've been off my anti-depressants for a few months and everything has been okay, until now. Some recent issues with people at work and now this and I'm feeling like I would probably be better off with biological death. Typing this out is therapeutic, at least, it's been all stream-of-consciousness so I don't even really know what I'm going to write next. Just trying to get it out there, maybe to try to help justify it to myself or maybe I'm craving attention, I really don't know.I'm three drinks into a six pack (Washington Gold Cider's Golden Delicious, it's amazing and I recommend it) and trying to hold back tears that I didn't expect. I didn't have anywhere else to turn because I'm definitely not talking about this shit to my wife or calling my mom all the way back in NC and worrying her to death.  

  

Which, that's the only hiccup. I still have some sort of dilemma about killing myself and how it will affect my family. I don't know if I actually want want to be alive, but I know I don't want to hurt them. I know my biological father and all of my new siblings would be pretty much crushed. Especially the 3 year old, we spend so much time with her. My wife would be left all alone 3000 miles from her support structure. My mom would be 3000 miles away when she got the news and I know she wouldn't take it well at all. They're who I'm holding on for, but I can feel myself slipping. It's becoming easier and easier to justify it to myself that they would eventually get over it, and at the same time it wouldn't be my problem any longer. So I guess I'm somehow talking myself out of feeling bad about it by shutting it out emotionally, saying it won't be my problem after I'm dead, which sounds really fucked up now that I read it.  

  

I don't know, man. Over the course of writing this, I guess I've talked myself out of it for now but I'm not entirely convinced it's a bad idea. I don't require any replies to this, I guess I'm talking to myself as much as to you strangers on the internet. In any case, I would like to thank you for reading should anyone actually bother."
1874,Coworker joked about suicide ffs,"(TW) I work in retail and I was complaining to a girl I work with about the stock being all messed up and she grabbed a container of box cutter blades and said “here’s some razors you can go slit your wrists and then you won’t have to deal with this anymore” and was laughing like it was so funny. I didn’t know what to do so I laughed along with her, I was shocked and so taken aback I know I should’ve said something about it not being funny but I was frozen. 

She doesn’t know about my self harm or suicidal thoughts and stuff but holy moly it was like someone punched me straight in the stomach. Why do people think saying or even thinking about stuff like that is funny?! I understand using humour as a coping mechanism but this was just blatantly taking the piss out of suicide like it’s such a funny thing. Feeling pretty on the verge rn as my self harm has already been getting out of control and the fact that that’s how people will look at me, like a worthless creep, is not what I needed."
1875,I don't think she understands my only reason for living is the hope I get to be in my daughter's life.,"So long story short I'm not really happy with my life . Every time I try to Express myself, it's flipped on me making me seem like a complete asshole,  my birthday this year was horrible.  I never had a worse day mentally.  Life has been hard on me i haven't ever had someone actually care about me as a human being.  I always been the guys who listened and gave decent advice that i myself couldn't follow.  But now I'm 30 i never wanted to live this long to get my bone acheing  and I've spent most of my adult life in jail for petty crimes, I'd done to survive my worst petty crime los Angeles gave me 3 years in prison for stealing a tuna sandwich and celery for my my pregnant baby's mother.  I missed my daughter's birth and she'll never forgive me for it she moved to Vegas and she held a mean grudge never really allowing me to see my daughter except for rarely now my daughter's 6yrs and she's asked for me ,,and i got my life together pretty good well the other day its was my birthday i feed my daughter and put her to sleep early , then popped my sleep medication for guaranteed sleep , however bm called said she was on her way &gt; i told her she had to hurry up.  She wouldn't let me get to sleep after letting her in then house my daughter asleep in the front room and me trying to go to sleep in the backroom , with my beats speakers playing sleep meditation music,  I closed my door she comes in why are you being rude ? While flashing her flashlight on me in the dark instead of turning on the lightswitch i ask her how i was being rude she wouldn't answer, then she started asking repeatedly are you okay i said no i just wanted to go to sleep.  She wouldn't get out my room so i went off , i started saying mean things I  didn't mean , eventually kicking them all out . I was disrespected in my own house on my birthday and all i wanted to do was sleep.  And now it's my fault.  She lying telling me my daughter doesn't want to talk or see me . I start to off myself today put i was going to explain what happened that day to her first ended up accidentally calling bm and she called me back I swallowed my pride like I've always done , and answered she acted like it was really my fault and had audacity to tell me she feared her own father and loved him and he whooped her ass and was strict with her but , that outbursts I had wasn't acceptable like she didn't provoke me . So now all i can do is hope she accepts my apology and makes it possible for me to continue being in my daughter's life.  If she doesn't my reason for surviving so many close deaths and tribulations in my fucked up life with the shitty hand i was dealt is gone. I've had so much pain and heartache in my life none checking on me to see if I'm ok or not what's my purpose in life ? Females tell me that I'm fine and handsome,  I'm a gentleman by nature but I'm always been alone and rejected I guess good guys really do finish last ."
1876,Goodbye,"I can't do it anymore. I don't even have anyone I can say goodbye to or that would even care or listen,  so I wanted to just put it out there on here. 

I'm sorry. Goodbye."
1877,Who's ready for some bullshit,"So being the stupid 16 year old I am, I wrote this weird shit in my notes app in 10 minutes, don't read if you don't want, cause dear god does it sound like edgy bullshit to me.


Daddy only straggers round when he's drunk
Mummy only screams when she's bored

I wildly swing from here and there
Tonight I shall laugh and write beautiful words
Tommorow I shall lament the fibre of my being and be desperate to end it

Mother will force love down my gullet
Only to scream how much she hates it all the next hour
Father will claim I am wonderful
Then comes the sneaky comment of how awful I truly am

I cannot peep while the war below rages on
They will smell out the tears of the aftermath 
And you will be sorry for having felt human

Even the music within my soul
Cannot play loud enough to drown the horrors out
They want you to know they are above you
And they will be until I fight my way from the walls of the house"
1878,What's a fairly easy way to kill myself?,
1879,I used to be so good,"I was a really bright kid until about 7th grade. Every adult in my life commented on how charismatic and clever I was. I'm still not totally sure what happened.

I think a combination of realizing my childhood was kinda fucked and a horrible abusive relationship led me to where I am now, seven years later. I'm not a good person. I can't keep a friend, I'm no longer smart, and I just flunked out of college. College that my parents were paying for. 

I am a failure as a child and a person. I'm a waste of time and money. Today I broke up with my boyfriend of almost two years- my loving, goofy, optimistic, doting boyfriend- because I want to end it. 

I've tried to kill myself in the past. I never had the balls to go through with it. But now, I've fucked up my ENTIRE future. I have no chance of being happy r successful. I have nobody and I deserve nobody. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. I'd like to say it's just so I can write out my thoughts in a safe space, but in reality I'm just fucking being an attention whore. There's nobody to blame for my failure but me. 
But I will be damned if anybody else has to keep suffering because I exist."
1880,My life is falling apart,"My mum just had a huge breakdown about me forgetting her upcoming birthday, and I didn’t really understand what the big deal was. But it sent me on a huge guilt trip and now I’m thinking of killing myself, and I’m only 14. I just can’t take the hassle of life much longer."
1881,Anyone can answer me this question?,"why are there people who have no social fears in their entire lives, who go through life without problems? I am 19 and have had social fears and suicidal thoughts since I was 17"
1882,I might honestly kill myself soon.,"I've been thinking about it for a while. Perhaps, for more than a while. My life has been a cycle of ups and downs. I never had the opportunity to develop social skills because I grew up with a narcissistic mother. When I went to a group home everyone sat in a circle so they could tell me why they hated me. This was supposed to help me improve my social skills. For a while, it did, but I quickly realized it would never be good enough. Growing up with a narcissistic mother, I lost my voice. I completely stopped speaking. I started speaking again and everything was chaotic. I could never say the right thing. I have been speaking ""comfortably"" for a while now, though there are still some times when I just am unable to speak. For a while, I was illy comforted by the concept of if I get good grades, eventually all this will end. Then I realized what bullshit this was and stopped caring. If I don't kill myself this winter, I suppose I'll start caring again. It's about survival: until I make an action I have to survive comfortably. I have no friends, and frankly, I won't make them. I don't have the ability to make friends. My grades will be low this semester because I stopped caring. I barely talk to my family. The family member I do talk to is stressed when I show emotion. I am truly all alone. I get these moments where I am sure that I will end it soon. Someone in my college killed themselves yesterday by jumping down a stairwell. You see, I am frightened by pain. If I do it, I want to make sure it works. I've tried to hang myself before, and it was so painful. I tried to do it after forgetting how painful it was and quickly remembered. A stairwell simply doesn't seem efficient enough. I am tired of living. I want out. I don't even have anything to wake up to anymore now that my cat died."
1883,This time of the year is the worst and I don't want to see the next,"I thought I saw a bit of hope for the future today, probably in some fantasy thing I probably imagined, but it's gone now. Replaced by a breakdown and now I never want to get up again. It's so shit. 

By my age, people are studying and working. Some are starting businesses and some are having kids. I've failed the first two, and I'm so useless and I haven't made any progress there's no point to trying to fix all this shit. I can't even go outside because I'm anxious and even if I did I have to wear leggings and long sleeves in +40 degrees. At least no one has to look at my repulsive self then.

I'm sorry for my rant. Thank you if you read it. It's late afternoon and I'm shaking, crying, unclothed and covered in blood and I never want to breathe again."
1884,I guess I wanna just vent...,"I met someone so special. Took my mind off everything and for this past week, things have been looking up for me. Now you tell me you are getting deployed. 8 months, and thousands of miles, so much can happen. What if you find someone else? Who makes you more happy? I'm just so sad now I wanna die."
1885,"15 years old, don’t know what to do","Slowly failing school, distancing myself from family and friends, closeted trans and bisexual, my only friend is my girlfriend of over a year and she would leave me if I came out as trans to her. Repressing who I am and constant stress and bullying at school for being a feminine guy back me into a corner and suicide keeps calling my name. I’ve almost done it so many times and but I really would rather get my life together but I don’t know how and I’m getting worse each day. Please help"
1886,"Failed 10 out 16 credits, lost financial aid and $17k+ in fees and have to go home and tell my parents",I tried not to slack off but I had a terrible roommate situation and issues with another student and couldn’t do it. Best way really just seems to avoid it all. All in all life just sucks.
1887,Before you die todo list,"What are some things you should do before you die? 

Example:
Life insurance, with waiting periods served and paper work left out."
1888,Don’t know if this is the right place,I’m sitting here with a knife against my skin and it has been so long since I felt this way but I just feel like every time I hit “rock bottom “ there’s something else that throws me under. I just want to be okay.
1889,What's the point?,"I was hurt and abused by a former partner. I should have seen it coming. The red flags were there all along. I ignored them because I thought if I loved him enough, if I loved him the right way, everything would be okay. 

And now it's over, for my safety. Unfortunately my sanity is no long intact. It's been over a week and I just feel worse every day. I feel dead inside. Hopeless. Useless. I am a complete failure. 

I cant trust people or myself. I dont have the energy to heal from this, nor do I see a point. I'd rather just sleep forever and avoid dealing with this pain."
1890,Suicidal thoughts from social anxiety and depersonalization,"recently ive been getting really bad suicidal thoughts. i just view life as a simulation game of some sort. that im just arms that does things that can see. it’s hard to explain but what i mean is i don’t think my life is real. this feeling ruins me greatly. me thinking life isn’t real is making me suicidal. i just want this game to end. on top of the depersonalization, i have social anxiety and im very shy. because of my social anxiety i can’t do anything. i can’t make new friends. and i just isolate myself from my classmates, making me more unpleasant to talk to. people just terrify me. the thought of them judging me terrifies me. people have judged me for no reason before. i only have 5 friends. it’s pathetic. they feel more as acquaintances rather than friends. im so lonely. i want to die. this social anxiety won’t go away even with the meds im taking. i’ve taken the meds for more than a month and nothings working. it won’t go away. it won’t go away. i just want it gone. im still miserable and i’ll continue being lonely forever. im just a burden to my family. i keep causing problems for people unknowingly i feel like shit. i feel like an empty vessel. i just want to disappear. it’s too bad i can’t. death is too scary for me. actually, it’s the pain that’s scary. if i want to kill myself i have to deal with a lot of pain which sucks. also, my parents and sibling is not accepting of people who kill themself, which pushes me away from suicide. also, i know they care. i have friends who care. but i can’t get these thoughts out of my head. i keep living in my head. i don’t know what to do. i made a post on what will happen if i overdose so i can have a way to die when i snap. unfortunately it’s not a sure way of death."
1891,Before 2020 I'm leaving out,"I'm going to blow my brains out, either by Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve.

Life is awful. People are awful. I can't wait to be dead in a grave.

Blissful nothingness."
1892,its says in google that 16 minutes underwater will be fatal....welp i will drown myself in the bathroom and lock it so no one can get or notice easliy lol,"i just need some kind of tank or something to fill my whole body in water

i dont have a bathtub in the bathroom i just need to find something to drown myself in

((((not yet dont worry))))"
1893,Everything is gone,"It's like I've been in a constant daze. Each day is a constant struggle to stay alive. No friends. My family is like ghosts. I'm constantly sick. My grades... I dont even know if I'll be able to graduate. I wanted to go to an Ivy League school. Be a lawyer. Then once I was in a position to I'd become an activist. It's silly I know. I just want to live a financially comfortable life so I can pursue the things that make life amazing. I want a job that I enjoy and fulfills me, even if it's hard. I'm only 15 and I dont know how long I'm going to live. People can die of a broken heart. I've stopped being able to get out of bed most of the time. I cant sleep. I'm nauseous. I'm losing weight. Depression is physically killing me. On top of it everyone assumes because I'm sick so much I'm skipping school even though doctors have diagnosed me as actually being sick and have provided doctors notes. Ive been sick enough that I've needed to go on antibiotics multiple times and they had to test me for terminal illness. This isnt oh just get out more or oh talk to more people. This is people  treating me with so much hatred when I didnt do anything wrong. The looks on the other students faces... it's like I'm a monster to them. The teachers? Like I'm lazy. Like I'm a problem. A deadweight. An issue. Rather than a symptom of one. I've been on medications. Gone to therapy. I've tried so hard to work it yet to everyone I'm a burden. ""Resistant to treatment"" I have to find out if theres other conditions that are causing the medication to not work yet we dont have the money to take me to the doctor because I go to the doctor all the time and my dad who brags about how much money he has, lives in a huge house, and works so much he cant even drop me off at school (or he just chooses not to) wont help me without trying to get something out of it or flat out refusing. My mom can only work 2 days a week because of him and the people at her work who wont put her on for anything shorter than literally 12 hours. On top of that she has to deal with bullying and sexual harassment. She cant afford to take care of me with my mental disabilities and whatever the fucking hell is going on with my body that's making me feel like I'm always fucking dying. I have no self control anymore because it's all being eaten away by depression. My teachers hate me or ignore me. The students hate me or ignore me. The looks. Oh the looks. If you dont have enough common sense to realize that someone who is in all upper level classes, has no friends, and who had B's before this isnt a delinquent, then why the hell are you judging me? For things I cant control no less? Then, oh and this is absolutely mental, I'm supposed to get 3 or 4 weeks worth of work done in one week? Are you kidding?! Who am I, Kim Possible? And they're mad at me for not meeting those impossible standards?! And they wonder why I cant talk to teachers when they're so angry and intimidating. You yell at the students then expect me to feel comfortable talking to you, are you crazy? I'm so tired of it all. I'm so angry. I want to do *something* *anything* big enough that'll make me feel like a human. Like I'm worth it. Like I'm valid. Like I dont have to quadruple check every thought and feeling I have because everyone makes me feel so insignificant and invalid! I'm not enough."
1894,Gun in house,I know where it is
1895,I'm out bro fuck this,
1896,I don't know how to help my loved one,"It's pretty hard for me to process this but my loved one is planning to leave this world at the start of 2020.  Since the beggining of 2019, it was his worst year ever(we met in march, so 9 months together), he had been through a painful breakup and has been dissappointed in life for so many reaccuring bad situations. He's such a sweetheart and I love him like nobody else in this world and just a few hours before we talked and he wanted me to understand his plans. I'm really scared. Please, how could I help him, because if he leaves, I will leave too. 
Sorry for bad grammar, I'm just really scared and can't stop crying"
1897,I need to vent,I need to vent. I'm fucking pissed and I'm alone with a knife in my room.
1898,(Serious) i might end my life soon.,"In 29 and ive been trying to earn my degree for 10 years, failed half my classes and i might get kicked out my program now... 

Im only 4 classes away from graduation but with my current GPA i dont see myself getting the degree even if i pass those classes.

Im posting this so that if i do decide to do this my friends and family will know why"
1899,confused in life,"So confused with everything in life at the moment, my   Ex makes it worst, family, friends, school and depression. I couldn’t eat and I was so sleep deprived for a week and then I broke up with my ex and now it’s gotten worst, it’s such a stressful situation and people tell me to focus on myself but right now I’m busy with family problems. I wanna do so much activities but can’t. I feel so hopeless and like there’s no point in anything, I can’t get out of bed for the most part and food makes me feel sick. I can’t sleep and I’m failing school and I’m bound to have summer school. In school I get crazy anxiety and there’s no chance I’m switching to home school because of an abusive household. My mom has kidney failure and my dad is the only one that works but he’s an alcoholic and old. I barely have friends at school and I’m to lazy to make them because they’re all so fake. I struggle with self harm and have so much intrusive thoughts. I see things out of the corner of my eyes and put all these horrible scenarios in my head that change my perception. I can’t afford to get help or help my family I feel like a burden. I know how easily people get over deaths these days and I feel as rather I caused my moms sickness and she’s dying because of me and all the stress she has because she chose to go down the path of having me."
1900,Does a psych hospital even help,"My only fear is that I'll mess up and end up in a coma. The only thing I fear more than having to live, is having to live in a shell of a body I cant kill. I have no family. My partner is abusive and tricked me into moving in when I was a stupid, fragile teen. I restarted my life once and dont have the strength to do it again. 

What on earth could a psych hospital offer that can even begin to prevent me from wanting death once I leave? 28 years of absolutely nothing but hell, what life is there with no happy foundation? 

I guess I'm screaming into the void one last time for any kind of answer. All the therapy and meds in the world havent saved me. Maybe some people just aren't meant to live."

1904,I pulled the trigger,"I'm very drunk right now, so apologies if this post is incoherent.

I bought a 10mm pistol a couple of months ago (a Glock 20 SF, to be exact). I've been mentally preparing by shooting myself with an unloaded gun, but today I loaded it and pulled the trigger almost all of the way--just before the stop. I don't know the technical term for that stop thingy is, but suffice it to say that if I had twitched, I'd be dead right now.

I  think I'll write about how I got to this point on the depression subreddit or something, but for now... I just wanted to tell everyone in the world I loaded a gun and pulled the trigger a millimeter before it wad would have killed me.

I was pointing at the side of my head. I've heard it suggested that in the mouth is better. I'm not sure. Something about shooting myself in the mouth freaks me out. I can't explain it. Any advice would be appreciated"

1906,"Why do people that are clearly better off and have more opportunities say that ""There's always resources"" for me","This person that I'm talking to told me that I theres ""always a way where I can find resources"" but that just isn't true. They go to this expensive ass mental health facility and downplay government owned ones (which I get they're ass but not everyone has money to throw around for these expensive as fuck places). I've tried explaining this to her and she doesn't get it. I don't have access to mental health help because of financial reasons, and because my abusive parents are tired of ""wasting money on me"". I don't go to college either because I've been suicidal. My college mental health resources are a joke. They had to cancel them because ""too few people"" were showing up. I have nothing to turn to."
1907,I need help.someone,Please someone just talk to me please anyone about anything I'm so close to just losing it again everything in my life is turning to shit everyone is gone I can't trust anyone in this world and this last week proved that so well I just threw my phone against a wall and broke down crying I wanna fucking die everyone I love has left me or doesn't love me back or uses me I can't live like this anymore I just.want it to stop I just need the pain to stop I try so much and fail everytime i can't I need.someone to take care of my dogs please
1908,I feel like I don’t deserve to me depressed.,"***just a warning: this is kind of a rant and kind of me questioning why I feel so miserable***

My life is fine. My parents are fine, though a little unfair and strict. My friends are the best and honestly probably the only reason I’m still kicking. I’m mostly just emotionally closed. In this sOciEtY (I make jokes because that’s how I deal with my emotions) women get it better. There’s a higher suicide rate in men than women and that’s just a fact. Now, I’m a woman. I’m “allowed” to feel emotion. But I just can’t handle them properly. I haven’t told my parents- or hell, anyone for that matter- that I loved them truly sincerely in about a year. I just can’t get the words out. There’s something in my head that physically disgusts me when I say it or it’s said to me. I don’t know what’s wrong, I just feel weird and anxious. This makes my mom and dad mad because what parent wants their child’s reply to ‘I love you’ to be a series of mumbles that vaguely make out a coherent ‘yeah... thanks’ right? If anyone else does this, please let me know. I have an older brother, about 2 years older than me. He had and still has major problems that require a lot of therapy. Still had a fine life, but I’m not judging him on that of course. He communicated with his VERY depressed and suicidal girlfriend through our shared iPhone 4. To call that brick with wires ‘shared’ was an overstatement. Even before my parents found out how she was influencing him, they liked him a lot better than me. I was an accident. It was his phone whenever he wanted it and my parents told me to stop whining when I just told them that I wanted it. Then, one day my mom (being the nosy bitch she is) picked up the phone and saw a text on the screen. It was about cutting. We lived on mostly the same playing field up until that incident.Then my parents (especially my mom) started getting paranoid and controlling of electronics because of course it’s that damn phone. His gf also went to the same school as him and they were inseparable You would think that they would restrict my brother more since that’s where it started, and that kind of did happen. He got the phone checked (aka taken away for hours on end) almost daily, but that also meant that I still didn’t get it. Mind you, after that I never complained. He got therapy, still does it weekly after a couple of years. Now in the new ages of technology, he has an iPhone X with no restrictions from our parents. I have an iPhone 8 with a screen time lock that makes it impossible to access any apps from 8 pm to 7:15 am every day. I still haven’t complained, though my parents say otherwise. They always say that I complain. That I’m lazy because I’m not motivated enough to get my sorry ass out of bed anymore. They say that I’m addicted to technology but they don’t see the other side. They don’t see that they made me hide out in my room on my phone all the time. I gag when I hear my moms footsteps coming down the hall towards my room. I jump when I hear my parents door open. I ‘yelp’ when I hear a sudden knock at my door. When my friends move too quickly or raise their hands above my head,(easy because I’m 5’2) I flinch and cover my face with my arms. My parents have never hit me. It’s more that I’m expecting them to at any moment. Like I deserve it for being the annoying piece of shit that they say I am. Of course they don’t say it directly. It’s just their actions and tones that I’ve grown up with. Many of my friends have it so much worse and I think even my best friend thinks that I’m being a bitch when I mention anything about my mental health, then again I have some major trust issues that could be affecting my thought process with those kinds of things. I kind of trust him, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fully trust anyone anymore and I don’t know why. All I need are answers. I don’t make eye contact. This may seem like an insignificant detail to most, but it just makes me feel different in a bad way. Like I’ll never be able to fit in no matter how hard I try. No matter how I shape my personality to my friends, I’ll never be able to fully please them. I’m not fake, I genuinely like my friends and their senses of humor a lot, that’s why they’re my friends. I laugh genuinely at their jokes and they make me happy. That’s not an issue. A major issue for me wondering if I deserve to feel all of these feelings is because I’ve never seen a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc. My parents are always preoccupied with my brother and hardly notice me. They haven’t asked about my mental health in a couple months because I had been wearing hoodies in the middle of a california summer. I don’t think they care anymore. My mom is always at work and my dad is at his desk doing fuck knows what and my brother is off doing social stuff and nerd shit. He always says that his friends don’t like him whenever they don’t respond within 5 minutes of him texting them. When he doesn’t get his way, he starts hysterically crying and if you don’t get away from him fast enough or tell him that he can have what he wants he starts this high pitched scream-yelling about how I’m so mean and that we never gave him anything and that I get everything just because when we were put in different rooms for the first time, he CHOSE the smallest one and now complains about the fact that I can fit three of his room into mine, completely disregarding the fact that FIRST he picked his room before I did, and SECOND, my room is used for fucking storage that the garage can’t fit. I worked my ass off to be able to get a dog, research, training, I have all of the responsibilities, etc. and it was only after YEARS of collecting knowledge, practicing on other people’s dogs and showing my dad my skills, that I was able to get a dog. She’s wonderful. I take care of her every need (except walks because ya know lack of motivation to open my eyes every morning and picking up after her as often as my dad wants but not JUST because I’m unmotivated, but because my dad wants me to do it “at LEAST twice a day.” I got to school. I wake up at 6 at the latest. When do I have time? This is when I’m called lazy.) and I love her more than I love myself. She’s the only one I can truly say I love. My brother does nothing except for walks OCCASIONALLY. Maybe feeds her a couple times when I’m not available. He says that I’m lazy. He says that he does everything for her. My parents agree. I don’t know what to do anymore. We’ve had this dog since July of this year because I got her for my birthday. I walked into the shelter and immediately locked eyes with this beautiful, nearly albino pittie that just set my world off of its axis. She was the one and we both knew it. And she’s been wonderful. She is NOT a problem. It’s also not the responsibility of her that hurts me. It’s the fact that I get no credit for it. This is all I’m writing for tonight, I’ll edit later if this gets anywhere but this is kind of a throwaway account so I won’t check it as often. Any help or personal stories are much appreciated."
1909,Help,Idk what to do. I'm tired. I can't do anything. I need help. Im stuck in a whirlpool and can't escape
1910,Does it get better?,"I feel like I’m not even half the person I use to be, I use to laugh at the dumbest things, I’d give the biggest hugs to people who complimented me/struck up conversations with them, I use to feel like this world was dark but there was so much good and now it doesn’t really feel like any good matters. My mind just feels rotten because of my social anxiety, I thought painting again for the first time in a while would help me but I just looked at what I made and cried, I just don’t feel like who I use to be and I hate it. I don’t like who I am and I know our lives don’t really “have a path but we can create one for ourselves” but I just really feel like I have no clue who I am. It feels like there’s always that option to just stop all of this, even when things feel okay. Things are bad, just end it. Things are  going okay? It won’t get any better than this moment, end it. I ignore all my friends and families phone calls and messages, I don’t talk to friends for weeks and i just feel like a horrible person, which I probably am. I try to hang out with them and I try to talk but it’s just all hard. I want to feel better but it’s been this way since October of 2018, a couple good times have happened since then but this really is the longest depression period I’ve ever had. I just feel all over the place and disconnected at the same time. It just feels like a cycle and I’m so exhausted of going through it again and again. This feels like it’s never going to end."
1911,Please listen to me,"I don't want to come as needy, but right now, I really need to explain my situation...

Will update the post after a few hours to explain everything... I have my finals next week and I'm an emotional trainwreck..."
1912,Failure after failure,"How does one cope with going from the extremely overachieving kid in school to being an isolating, depressed waste that is barely hanging on?

Everyone around me assumes I’m some highly successful and motivated person because I used to run a bunch of advice spaces, I present at conferences, I’m trying to make a career change, and have hit a lot of personal goals over the last few years. In reality, I hit those goals and then I stagnated hard. I moved to a new city and have made zero new friends. I haven’t dated in 5 years and don’t feel like anyone would find me remotely desirable given the situation. I’ve been unemployed for 6 months first because I was recovering from a surgery and now because I need to stop smoking weed to get a job but I feel like weed is the only thing that is making my day worth living. Or maybe it’s not and I’m just convincing myself it is. I don’t know. I’m supposed to turn in my applications for nursing school in the next two weeks and I’ve told everyone around me the essays have been finished for months. I haven’t even started on them. Idk

I don’t know why I’m posting this

My birthday is in a few days and it just has be thinking about how much of a fucking failure I feel like. 25, no partner, no job, no one would even want to date me since I don’t have a job. Always thought I’d be married by this point. Don’t really think that’ll happen. I don’t even like being around myself these days. I just... idk I feel worthless and useless and like there isn’t a point"
1913,Don’t do it,If you considered or consider suicide don’t there’s so much of life to live and if you have money and your country is he’ll move to canada
1914,Was there a moment where you knew it wouldn’t get better?,"I’m not gonna get into mine. I’m almost out of my 20’s. Too ugly, too tall, too sensitive. It is almost comical the horrific shit that continues to happen so I don’t want this thread to be about me.

Was there a moment or event that kind of did it for you? Or put you in this current state of mind?"
1915,I feel loved,"I've been stressed and cripplingly depressed for a bit now. Finals are coming up, it's the holiday season, family stuff, and all that. 

But today I went into my school's cafeteria for a change for breakfast instead of going to class immediately or staying in my car. I sat by a senior student acquaintance I have and he had a really concerned look on his face. He said something to me along the lines of ""Are you ok? I haven't seen you around in like a month. Do you need a hug?"" and put his hand on my shoulder. 

I have a tendency to distance myself from people, especially really touchy/loud people, so I've kinda parted from sitting with him and his table at lunch for a month or two now? I don't know, I felt like I wasn't fitting in so I sit by myself now.

Anyways I was like ""What yeah I'm fine haha I just like sitting by myself I've been here all this time"" and gave him a weird look so he'd stop feeling bad for me. He stopped, which was nice, but after he turned away I felt like I almost wanted to cry right there. It felt SO NICE that someone who I dont even really consider much of a friend was just. worried about me? Like, a stranger practically is concerned for my wellbeing. Wow. I've been so miserable lately and seriously contemplating a lot of things (might do it in 2020) but he really lit me up today. School was still shit, but that was a nice way to start the day."
1916,The only reason I haven’t killed myself is death,"I’m not actually afraid of death, I’m just terrified of what happens after."
1917,Just got cheated on,What’s the point of anything if I can’t make one person happy
1919,Why is every fucking method so goddamn difficult/ineffective,"All of the fucking actually lethal methods are bullshit. Right now the leading candidate for me is drop hanging but that's a bitch to get right.


More of my considerations and why I'm pissed off about them:

+ gun: guns are expensive and can be difficult for us diagnosed mentally ill people to get. Plus it's gruesome as fuck 

+falling: this shit's so easy to fuck up and can leave you in a state worse than death if you mess up. I don't have anything around me that I'm confident is tall enough and I don't have any way to measure the height. 


+pills: almost never works 


+car ""accident"": hurts other people, might not work, leaves you fucked if it doesn't 


+alcohol: miserable and probly won't work if anyone finds you


+opioid benzo and alcohol combination: only have access to benzos and alcohol and I don't think that would be enough


+inert gas asphyxiation: extremely reliable, effective and peaceful but this shit requires like an engineering degree to be able to set up in a way that'll for-sure be effective"
1920,I tanked any chance I had of getting into med school. I feel like I've squandered my purpose. Should I just fucking kill myself?,"Slacked off hard this semester. I just got a C in an online fucking class. Any of the admissions people are going to look at that and think I'm a retard. 

There's nothing else for me to do. What am I going to do, actually use my biology degree? Yeah right."
1921,"Does anyone else have a dream that they want to accomplish, but just can't find the motivation?","     I feel like an idiot using dream,  but I can't think of how else to put it. There is something I want to do more than anything else in my life and I have the resources to do it, but I just can't find the motivation to. It's like I feel AMAZING when I am thinking about it and for a brief moment in my life I am happy, but when I get the chance to actually do it I feel like shit and try to think of any reason not to do it. Then later that day/ night I hate myself. I promise myself I'll do it next time and the cycle repeats. Does anyone else feel the same way? Has anyone managed to beat the cycle?"
1923,I hurt everyone around me,"My parents, my brother, my friends, my coworkers, I hurt them, not on purpose, I guess I'm just not good at being human. I have no one, I have no one to talk to or ask how I'm feeling, they're all mad at me or hate me for one reason or another. Every connection I make a end up destroying. I'm starting to think the pattern will never change and that this is just who I am. What's the point of living if I can't truly connect to people. Everyone has made it clear they want nothing to do with me so I might as well just kill myself."
1924,I'm an extremely short female and I admit it makes me want to commit suicide,"Being super short at 4'7"" makes me feel like I'll never be treated normally. My height will always be something people have to bring up, as if I have some disability. There's so many other reasons why being so short is making me depressed. Heightism is so bad. Short people get treated terribly and if you're extremely short like me, then you get treated worse. I don't want to go into detail about how my height has been making me miserable. If any other short person is reading this, then I'm sure you can somewhat understand how I feel. 

Society is not going to change anytime soon. They'll keep putting tall people on a pedestal and keep putting down short people without feeling bad. It's terrible how people think it's okay to make fun of someone's height. I just want to be loved and be with someone who treats me like a human being."
1925,What should I do to die?,"If Id do it I want it to be successful but cmon i dont have access to guns... Sleepasil overdose with alchohol seems u likely... Just give me something thats sure and accessible, never thought suicide was actually far more harder to pull off.

Dont talk me out of it... I have no motivation to continue this life anymore."
1926,help me help a suicidal person when i'm also suicidal,"this will be a bit long, rambly and probably badly written (i'm not a native english speaker), so apologies in advance, but please read

a little background on me first: i'm 19 and i genuinely cannot remember a time in which i wanted to be alive, but i only started actively thinking about suicide for the last 4 years and properly planning earlier this year. i think i'll do it in just a couple months. i haven't suffered any trauma or had any awful experiences, i just don't like being alive.

anyway, i follow some suicide and mental health related subreddits, including this one, and i'll sometimes message people that seem to be having a momentaneous crisis and try to calm them down, listen and just chat. i don't really message people that already seem convinced on killing themselves because i think people should be able to choose what to do with their lives for themselves, but with that being said i never encourage them to do it. most of the time, people don't answer my messages, but it seems to have worked a couple times.

one of the people i messaged was this young boy who thinks he has ADHD and dyslexia and is unable to go well at school, but his mother refuses to get him a psychiatrist and meds, call him names, says he brings her dishonour and cries if he gets bad grades. at first he was asking if he should get ADHD meds illegally and i told him it was risky, he could get ripped off, addicted or sick and that seemed to be it for a while, but he started messaging me having full on panic attacks, being very confusing and nonsensical, like he was very agonized, talking about how he was a serial killer in a past life and god was punishing him, that his mother wants him dead and that he is going to kill himself. i tried to give him advice multiple times, told him grades weren't as important as they may seem when all your life revolves around school, that he should live for himself, not his mother, that he should focus on getting better on something he likes and ignore the other subjects, suggested that he get a job and pay for his own therapy, and focus on education once he's better, but he glosses over my message and keep going on rampages. it's been like this almost every day for a month and it's draining me since i'm dealing with a bunch of shit with my own family right now and i don't know how to help him, but i don't want to just ignore him, since he seems very desperate and agonized

help?"
1927,What are the names of the pills that are commonly used for suicide?,
1929,12/12/19 - 11:15 pm,"my mother's friend just died in a car accident this morning. not much to say except fuck this.

i feel so guilty. i have a wonderful family and many amazing friends, but somehow i can't stand being here. i fantasize about being killed and killing myself. i don't mean i want to be brutally murdered, i just want to leave peacefully. i know i'm annoying and mentally draining, and i'm sorry. all of my friends are able to vent and rant without problems, but when i try i either stutter or breakdown. i feel trapped, like i'm in a different world and there's no way to cross the line between me and everyone i know. i'm always paranoid or pissed off, and it makes me lash out at others. i've avoided my classes because i'm too tired to sit down for an hour and *not* fall asleep.

i have so many suicide attempts planned out, if only i had the guts to actually use one of them; drowning in my bathtub late at night, crashing a car, laying down in the middle of the road and hope i'm fortunate enough to not be seen."
1930,I’m at a low,"I don’t know what to do anymore.  I’ve failed so badly in life, I’ve hurt the ones I love, everyone hates me and I have no hope.  There is no way my life will get better."
1931,Bois I’m still alive,
1932,Nobody knows,"On the outside I’m a happy and laid back guy. I’m 27M, go to school, hoping to go to law school after. But life is hard for me. I’m not going to bore you with all my issues. People would describe me as a fun and outgoing person to be around. But one thing they don’t know, I want to kill my self. 

I’m so sad inside, and I feel like such a loser. I can’t even afford to live on my own. I can’t believe I’m still in school getting a useless degree and then another three years of law school - who am i kidding? 

Sometimes I think about suicide and think, “damn it could allll just go away in a single shot.” I look at suicide and it just seems so simple. You take a gun, point it at your head, then bang, it’s all over. But I can’t do it. I don’t even have a gun.  

I’m hoping god can save me - god wasn’t always my friend. Idk why, I never hurt anyone. Idk If anyone is out there reading this. But whoever is, I hope you can pray for me. I promise I’m not weak minded or anything. I’m just the “outgoing guy” that want to mill himself, and no body knows."
1933,The love of my life wants to commit suicide because of me,and he blames everything on himself and I don't know what to do to stop him when I'm a hundred miles away.
1934,My fate is suicide,"I have no reason to live. Life is all suffering. I'm unattractive, weird, lesbian, have no potentials or direction. I barely have friends, never had sex or a girlfriend. I have never had anything good in my life. 

I can't trust or completely love anyone. Everyone hurts you at the end. Good people don't exist, this world is a fucking lie. I can't ever get married or have kids or find a woman. True friends don't exist. 

It's only going to get worse when I'm older. I'll live in a empty house, with nothing to do but work. No love or friends. I have no reason to live. My life doesn't matter. I was a mistake. I hate being alive and don't want to live anymore. 

My fate is suicide. I will die by my own hands. At least i get a choice in that."
1935,Just End It,"I can't commit suicide because of my kid. If I do he gets no financial support. Not to mention the anguish it would cause him.

If I die accidentally him and my wife will be well off.

Not an hour goes by that I do not hope I die accidentally or by criminal means.

I'm not afraid of what's after death. There is nothing. It's like flipping a light switch.  Death is like a dreamless sleep. No heaven, no hell.

I sort of envy people who are able to immerse themselves in religion, who have faith in something, in a higher power."
1936,How many Advil does it take to OD?,"To put it lightly, I caused my girl friend to attempt her life. I told her she wasn’t pretty and that I didn’t want to be with her anymore. I tore her heart out the first time I tried to break up with her. I stitched it back up by taking back what I said, then the next day I did it again. She was the nicest girl I have ever met in my entire life and she treated me I was an angel from above. Her entire family loved me and accepted me as one of them and I stepped on her heart like it was nothing. I became the person I tried to never become. I’m sorry Ava"
1937,I don't even remember what it's like to be a person anymore.,"Most days I feel like a vehicle to help other people reach their end goals. Anyone else? It kind of sucks that the only reason other people want me to stick it out is because they would feel sad or empty if I was gone. It's really not like I'm bringing anything g valuable to the table. I'm always cynical, unappreciative, and I don't have any goals or desires of my own. I'm becoming a fat alcoholic with no discernable skills and I have no idea why my partner is still with me."
1938,I can't see my life past christmas,Its gone too far. To everyone reading this you better get help when you get that first suicidal thought cause its only gonna get worse. I think im getting better because im getting less suicidal thoughts but they are also getting more intense for each time and i have allready tried to kill myself 4 times over two months. I have no friends anymore and i contacted those closest to me and told them my situation and that i have now chosen to leave the country to meet my online friends. But i don't know what is gonna happen afterwards. Am i going to get more lonely and think worse? Am i really never going too get someone who i really can connect with in my country!😟 I only need one person who i can really talk to and meet on a weekly basis and be really good friends with at the same time. It sounds pathetic but i know now that this is what i need and im gonna try till i die.
1939,nothing ever changes.,"    I mean, I try as hard as I can, I hide my feelings from others like a normal person should, and express myself in ways other people will never know. I'm trying to not think about it too hard, because that's how simple I am. I have a talent of not letting anything hurt me unless I want it to, to really build to something big. I think I'm doing it now, living for a bit longer to see how things go, and when they play out terribly, I knew it was going to happen. Basically I'm building up to killing myself, I'm close to it, but not yet. No more alcohol to fuel the fire, or sleeping pills to fasten the process, I'll do it with a sober mind, conscious of the second the stool falls to the floor, the way the rope claws on my neck, barely feeling it as I forget where I am for just a second. I'm even more burnt out than before after giving an attempt at life and I feel like an edgy 5 year old for writing this paragraph, please excuse me, there's more shit I need to experience before I commit the sayonara."
1940,When it’s over,I really hope and pray that all the people I loved and lost to death especially the untimely ones are there to greet me that’s the only thing that calms my fear is imagining the people who I loved that died before me are all there together and available for me to spend time with again. If I were certain I’d have left this earth  already. But like most of us I’m too scared to do it and I think of the people Who do care about me and how I’d be hurting them plus I’m dying from sickle cell anyway I don’t know how many years I have left bc I asked not to be told so I just have to live until I’m done anyway I’m all over the place thanks for listening back to my PlayStation and good luck to my fellow thread mates or subredditors idk I’m new to reddit don’t know the lingo yet
1941,No social skills means I’m fucked,"Holy fuck how are you even supposed to talk to people?! Conversations are extremely painful for me because there’s literally NOTHING on my mind when I talk to most people. This means that the conversation is extremely one sided and awkward. Most conversations I have with people I just want it to end asap so I can go back to being with my own mind. I guess I was just born this way because all my life I was always the quiet kid who preferred being quiet and alone and to just observe the world. But as I grow older I realize how important social skills are and how not having any severely decreases your chances of succeeding in a extroverted world. It just really sucks how I’m doomed to struggle in this society because of who I am. The corporate world hates those who are socially retarded and in such a competitive world already this just adds another layer of struggle. Fuck, life is really such a pain."
1942,"I’m 17, my liver is slowly starting to fail","It might take awhile, but if I go back to popping ibuprofen more than needed and drinking heavy I can die and make it look like an accident :)) anything to get me outta this fucked up thing called life"
1943,I did it,"I’ve been going through so much recently I can’t take it. I’m so scared and afraid and trapped. I have to care for so many people, I can’t do it! 

I finally began to do it. It was only a paper clip, it’s not that bad right? It will never be a knife, maybe a thumbtack or safety pin but it would ever go that far, right? 

I just can’t handle this anymore, I’m so trapped."
1944,how can i find out how much a fatal dose of a medicine is? google isn’t helping,
1945,The only thing keeping me from killing myself is my wife and daughter. I am beginning to resent them for it.,"I've talked to two therapist. They both encourage me to get a divorce (after a LOT of therapy). The issue is, I really think I can't handle the stress of a divorce. 

I love my daughter very much, and I want to see her grow up. However, I feel like a fucking robot that can't make anyone happy. I work harder and people ask for more of me.

Both my parents have died in the past year and my last words to both were ""fuck you"" (one deservedly, one not so much). I came from very humble beginnings and worked myself into management and after my dad died my work went to shit and I am getting canned. 

I just don't want to do any of this anymore, but I do becauee I have to. Not sure what I need or if I need anything from here, but it feels better to type it. 8 times I have had serious thoughts about suicide this year, everytime I think of my daughter and realize I can't.

The only thingnthatbreally help is smoking shittons of weed which, of course, leaves my wife dissappointed in me (I have been approved by a physician and live in an legal state. 

My younger brother is in jail and the whole system isndesigned tontake money from families and with me losing my job, it is expenaive to even talk to him.

Our world is cruel and I don't want to live in it.

I spent 10 years in the Army and did 3 tours in a Combat Arms job. I've earned real medals (bronze star with a V, ARCOM with a V) for actions in combat. No one gives a shit. No one cutsbyou any slack for killing for college money. For digging up IEDs for a poverty wage. For losing friends. 

And all I am is a disposable piece in this machine, school, work, the government, family. It's all just people in a line waiting for their piece of me.All this world and the people in it want is to take. I have nothing left to give. I am dead inside. 

I'll wake up and do it again tomorrow. I will wake up, get the babybready while my wife takes a shower. Drop off the baby. And gontrain my replacement and apply for jobs that will reject my resume. I'll home and work on my MBA homework so I can go hate my life for hopefully more money down the road. Fuck this all."
1946,Help this guy out,"He has been posting on r/JuiceWRLD, his name is like WesleyAVT or something and he is on the verge of suicide help him ( won’t let me cross post his post for some reason."
1947,Begining to hate myself again,I can never forgivemyself for what ive done. I hurt my SO so bad that it triggered her depression that she was just getting over and now shes suicidal. Obviously i havent told her how i feel because its my fault and i want to be strong for her so she can have me as a sholder to lean on but all i can think about lately is how much i messed up. Im the reason she wants to kill herself and ill never forgive myself for that. Ive been just numb to life lately and i just feel the world would be better off without me but if i did anything it would hurt her even more so i have a bit of a delema lol...
1948,Something,"Mamas son goes out

doesn't know he tried to die

So yells when he’s back"
1949,staying alive has been so exhausting,"I don’t know if I really wanna kill myself, but I’ve lost all hope. I hate my life and I feel it’s just getting worse. People always tell me “things will get better”, but when exactly is that going to happen? Many years have passed and it hasn’t gotten any better. I feel alone, destroyed, and meaningless. I don’t think I can keep up with my life..."
1950,I'm feeling desperate and like it's time and I have no other way,"This sounds exactly like what I'm sure everyone on this sub feels, to me. Everything good is coming to an end for me soon. I'm scared that I wont be successful and will just cause everyone more problems.  I'm so so so sad and hurting. Its pathetic but I really just need this to stop"
1951,I’ve been suicidal lately,"I just hate how I look. My body is fat and my face is ugly and I’m probably never going to be anything in life.  My height is 5’6 and I’m 134 pound female. But that needs to be lower I really want to starve myself I have starved myself in the past 6 weeks and it really does work. But I don’t know man, I’ve been having a mental breakdown everyday and I can’t handle it anymore."
1952,The adjustment period on some anti-depressants isn’t worth it.,"Crying in the bathroom right now and need to get this off my chest. 

I’ve been on a handful of anti-depressants now, none of which have worked. My doctor just prescribed me a new one because I told her I was having suicidal thoughts again and panic attacks, and it hurts my stomach SO BAD. Like, it feels similar to having swallowed a thousand mini daggers every single morning, and the pain lasts for about five or six hours after taking the pill.

In my experience, all meds have had a terrible adjustment period. I’m feeling hopeless right now, especially since nothing has worked for me yet. I have been on the new meds for about two weeks, but if this pain doesn’t go away I don’t think I can stand it for much longer"
1953,Please I need somebody to talk to me,"I'm so alone in an unwelcoming home, I was just diagnosed with another painful chronic illness, and just like the one I already had, there is no cure.

My only friend is my boyfriend and he is absolutely tired of me and my problems, and I don't blame him. I am across the country from any other family or friends, not that my family would help me in a time like this anyway.

I'm 19 years old. I've been homeless, starving, abused, sexually assaulted hundreds of times. I am a hollow shell of a human being.

All I want to do right now is self harm. I'm begging for help before I hurt myself worse than I already have tonight. I'm home alone where no one can stop me. 

My roommates have a rifle and it would take me under 15 minutes to steal it and kill myself on the mountainside where nobody would know, and nobody would have to see or clean my body."
1954,Air dusters,I’m inhaling airduster in hopes it’ll suddenly kill me. My parents hate me. My friends actually despise me. I scream but no one hears me.
1955,I'm too scared to do it,"It makes me so mad that I can't do it, but I'm scared, terrified actually. Terrified of the pain that I'll cause to others and to myself even if I feel like I deserve it. I just can't get myself. I want to die so bad because I'm just so tired of living this life that everyone says it's so great but I only see something useless that can be thrown away, yet I can't still do it. Why can others do it and I don't ? I just don't get it. I want peace. I want silence. I don't want to worry about anything anymore."
1956,I’ve been thinking of suicide,"Life has lately been hell for me, and it’s gotten to the point that I just want to end it all. The only thing that’s stopping me is how my mother would feel about it. I know she would blame herself saying she was a bad parent, but she wasn’t. I just don’t know why I should stay in this world anymore other than my mom"
1957,Ingested 250 mg of zoloft,"Hi. I'm 5'4, and 147 lbs. My brain is already getting funky, and I'm gonna go out eating a totinos pizza. I'm really sad, and my lifes gone into a pit. The one dude I like doesnt like me back and its crushing me. I wont be able to transition for many years, and I'm living basically in a special hell created just for myself. Visions are setting in, ghosts are in my peripheral. My totinos is done, luv. See yall on the other side. Turning on archer- hopefully I die watching a show I love. Also, I ate some random pills and it's making me get funkayyy"
1958,Invisible,"Every day I go through the steps, hours flying by. My parents look at me in disgust. Those who I thought were my friends always end up leaving me. I’m numb. I’m numb but at the same time there is this burning pain in my chest that’s screaming. But nothing comes out of my mouth. I’ve been thinking about suicide since 10. But right now. I sit here with this can of air duster, oxycodone, and booze. And I wonder, when will anyone here my screams of pain, on the other side of this glass wall?"
1959,Been drinking whiskey all night and got a bottle of xanax ready to down,I'm imtired of dealingnm with lifes shit thisnis all bullshit. Mt wife loves chatting and flirting with other guys and in always left high and dry I cant so this shit snymkre I'm so fed up and I wanna end it all theres no escape I don't wanna leave because I have nothing els e to go to or start eiyb
1960,Going to Tijuana to do blackjack and hookers,Heard Americans are getting shot for free over there. Sounds like a good deal.
1961,Being incel,"Being an incel isn't a choice, like some people make it seem. No one chooses to be like this and live a life of isolation and sadness, constantly imagining what it'd be like to feel normal like everyone else. I just feel so angry at everything and everyone, the way people behave. Some people are lucky to be born naturally attractive, extroverted and sociable, having people who actually want to be in a relationship with them, be it romantic or just friendship, which sounds like such a foreign idea to me. No one has ever ever approached me to start a conversation and I feel like they'd all reject me if I ever dared to. I'm not interesting enough to spark anyone's interest. It's so depressing knowing that I'll never share moments of happiness in the company of someone I love. . I honestly get sad everytime I hear a girl saying a guy is ''handsome'' and ''attractive'' cause I know they'll never talk about me using such words, or have have any feeling towards me other than pity or indiference. While some people get attention all the time, others never truly enjoy their lives. They just survive, crying in vain waiting for a better life, a day they will feel less inadequate, but that day never comes. With women, the attention they receive from society is even more bizarre. Any average looking woman can get more attention from men in one single day that an average looking guy during his whole life. And even ugly women have it way better than ugly men. And by the I'm not just whining about sex here and not having a girlfriend/wife. I crave human contact so much, I also really wish I had a friend to talk with and share what I feel.. btw I'm not hating on women, that's just how the world is, why would they want to be with losers like me when they have infinite better options ? But anyways, just to finish this shitty rant(English is not even my native language, sorry for the odd wording, and I'm just not good at writing in general) I must remember you that on this earth not everyone will feel hapiness, apparently not everyone deserves to be happy. In our society, some people get to experience it while others rot alone, waiting for death. I just hope I can have the courage to take my own life soon enough and end my pathetic existence. I feel like death is close."
1962,How do you deal with feeling like a hateable burden,
1963,One Last Heartache,"i keep having the same dream every single night, it always ends with me dead in my front yard.

i’ve been going through relationship problems, i’ve never been close to my family, i’ve isolated myself from all my friends so i have nobody now, and i have to just accept that i’ll never be the person i want to be so desperately 

with all these heartaches i’ve been dealing with these past years, i think it’s only fitting that i go out with bullets in my chest. i’m hoping my dream becomes a reality really soon"
1966,Anyone talks about how their life is so gifted but they still want to kill themselves?,"I won't say my life is very gifted but I don't have financial problems. I think I am more intelligent than most other people. I have a satisfactory job and my career prospect seems to be reasonably promising. I have dated and had sex with some good girls although also with bad girls and I don't have any girlfriends now.

But I don't feel any sense of accomplishments. All my accomplishments are just facts and honestly my accomplishments aren't really distinctive when compared with other better people. I understand it's meaningless to compare but I feel also meaningless to anything I have done and planned to do. The voice inside is always, 'So What?'. I am empty even though my stomach, my body and my life is full."
1967,Ruined my life," Well, basically I'm what you'd call an absolute and utter fuck up. I ruined my first year of college by missing classes, smoking and playing a stupid mobile game, but rather than improving and learning from my mistakes I'm on the path of repeating what I did in my first year due to the same stupid mobile game that my fuck up self couldn't stop playing, it gave me a weird self-gratification that I don't believe my life could give me, and honestly being good at that game is probably my only achievement worth shit. At least in my first year, I was passing 2 or 3 classes, this year I've absolutely failed everything in the first semester. I recently just finished talking with my mom; shes devasted. She told me that she hates my dad for letting me go to a catholic school rather than a private one, and said if I was sheltered none of this would happen. I've come to the conclusion that I'm not good for anything, nor is my garbage life worth anything. I want to just end everything right now, maybe then my parents won't have to waste any money on such a useless human being like myself. I've thought of it countless times but this is the closest I feel to actually doing it. My parents, brother, friends all believed in me and i continue to fail them, they'd be better with me I'm sure"
1968,change in thought,"I've always dealt with suicidal thoughts so I'm not scared of them. But lately they've become more intense before it would just be about me erasing myself from this world.

But now I have thoughts  of self-immolation, the need to feel more pain or how I deserve to feel that pain. It's like being aflame will cleanse me of everything maybe atone for something? I don't know.."
1969,I think I need someone to talk me out of doing it,"Hi, I am increasingly having more and more thoughts of going away forever. I don't even know what to say. I don't want to die but I am so tired"
1970,"""But the world is beautiful, there's so much to live for!""","No, not for everyone. Maybe there is beauty in the world somewhere but there are people who really can't access to it, or at least not enough to outweigh their darkness.


Don't just say go watch a sunset or pet a kitten and act like that will cure suicidal depression.



And also, I think the world is pretty shit. The absolute depravity of humans is literally limitless. People will do *anything* to each other in the interest of self preservation or just pure sadism. The world is literally ending because of corporate greed. Why is life such a gift?"
1971,Things right now are so low I seriously don’t know what to do,"2 weeks ago (I think) I decided I was gonna kill myself but my friend talked me out of it sort of

Then a week later I regretted not doing it... and now, I regret not doing it even more.

The only things making me happy right now are suffocating myself (not in a sexual way) and sucking on whipped cream cans.

Then just like an hour ago me and my dad were in the car and I was arguing that I wanted to go back to school (I’m not in school, I just wanted to go back because I’m not even in high school yet), and he was yelling at me and so basically I called him boomer and he straight up flung his fist at my face like it was the family feud buzzer and he had the answer.

So I just let myself bleed until he notices and yells more about how the shirt is ruined now... but that’s why I did it. So that he’d pay for doing that.

Welp, I’ve decided to stop calling him my dad from now on, but that won’t be very long because I’ll probably be dead"
1972,"Im going to kill myself, I don't see the point.","What's the point of life, we get up, we do the shit society tells us to do and then do nothing. What's the point in going through life that will end in death. Why not end it now? I cannot see myself living past my early 20s. I don't see the point in doing life. Like why. It fucking sucks. It's full of sadness and no matter what I'm going to die. So fuck this I'm done with life."
1973,I can’t do it. I can’t do anything. I have to die,I just failed one or maybe two college classes my first semester. My depression and anxiety just keep getting worse. I have a boyfriend and I’m far away from my shitty friends and family but I can’t do anything. I am hardly functioning in anyway. My dad cussed me out and said I cant return to school next semester because i failed a class. I have nowhere to live. I can’t pass classes. I will never amount to anything. Only option is death
1974,Help,Thinking about suicide and would love too hear some advice.
1975,Nothingness,"Well where do I begin, I can’t feel anything anymore. Like it’s just the same old thing wake up and get through the day. It’s hard to explain I just can’t feel anything it’s like I have no feelings. I have almost ODd twice, that was the only time I felt at peace with myself, it was like a big weight just lifted off of my chest. I want to feel that again. I have already written my last note. I made it clear that I don’t want anyone to be sad when I’m gone. Idk when I’ll be gone but I get closer and closer every day. At random times I’ll just get a voice in my head telling me to do it, and after a while I started to believe them. I never imagined it would come to this. I know it just seems like I’m just bitching about problems but death is a relief it’s like your soul being set free, I remember distinctly feeling nostalgic and euphoric. It was a beautiful feeling. When I woke up I felt cold, I couldn’t tell if I was dead or what. Other things bother me like am I depressed? Hell it seems like everyone is depressed these days. Am I mentally ill? Is something wrong with me? Guess I don’t even know. Guess this is both a blessing and a curse, I don’t know when my time will come but just know I have traveled into a better place, DO NOT CRY FOR ME. 

I love you all"
1976,I've decided.,"But,the question is,which would be the quickest:Suicide by gunshot to the head...Or suicide by nation?  


And let me explain that: Given how North Korea and China are..I've been thinking about suicide by nation(suicide by cop x100,if you will) And it's like this:  


1-Head for either South Korea/Japan/ANYWHERE on the west coast/Hawaii(Preferably in/or near any large city/military base)  


2-Wait for trump(Unfortunately,the way things are going=4 more years of this SOB.) to bomb North Korea.  


3-Just wait for North Korea/China to blow the crap outta the place...Hopefully,death should be quick(nuke=instant vaporization...good way out,I'd say.)  


And if you're a weeb like I am,or you're into K-pop or shit like that,you can take in those before you die...and you'll at least die happy.  


The world/country is fucked up  and getting worse(example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNkFVA2JhhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNkFVA2JhhQ) ) Why wouldn't you kill yourself..people in this country want you DEAD anyway,if you're say,A liberal(and don't believe their lies to the contrary...they would put a bullet in your head ON COMMAND from trump if he were so inclined,remember,""I could shoot someone on fifth ave. and not lose support?"" Yeah.)  


So,suicide=is a good idea,and from now on,I will NOT hear any ideas to the contrary. I just want to stick around to see how horrible things get...then I'm out of here.  


That's it."
1977,Cut my face,"I’ve been in a very depressing and anxiety ridden season in my life, due to family and relationship problems. Last night I cut my wrist after not doing so in about a year. And then today I cut my face. I had the urge to do so all day since I woke up so I decided to give in. Anyone have any idea why I must’ve gotten that urge? Why did I do that?"
1978,what’s the point,"what even is the point anymore
i’m pathetic"
1979,"I can't wait to be free from my pain. I know I will die within the next months, but","what do I do about my parents and brother? 
No matter how our relationship is or has been, they will be devastated. It will ruin their lives.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
I can't keep living for them.
Knowing that they're there and that they'll have to deal with it is the worst. 
I will pass my pain on to them. They will remember it until they die themselves.
But I can't keep living for them. I'm unable to feel anything but pain and I know this will never change.
Whenever I realize what reality is I'm in tears.
I've cried so much already. .
I've had a lifetime of pain already, if not more.
I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of being in pain from when I wake up to when I fall asleep every day, without being able to experience any relief, ever.
I deserve to have died already.
I can't anymore

Serious question, how do I possibly prepare my parents for something like this?
They know that I have mental illnesses but they have not the slightest idea of how bad and unendurable it has really gotten.."
1980,I'm tired of life,"Nobody's gonna see this and I don't care either. I just fucking can't anymore. You're born, against your will, you go to school for like 13 years, then you work a minimum wage job paycheck to paycheck for like 50 years, and then you rot in a retirement home until you die. I wanna do something with my life, but I can't. Im bound by the basic duties and responsibilities of life. And you're probably expecting me to say how I deserve better and shit, but the reality is, I don't. Life doesn't owe you or me shit. And what's the alternative? Am I not going to go to school? Am I not going to work? Well, im sure that would turn out great in the long run.

Is it fair that you're thrown into a world against your will? A world where all you do is work, work, work until you die. It's not. It's not fair. Life isn't fair and I hate it. There are amazing, smart, talented people that will live terrible lives and there's nothing you can do about it and there's terrible, fucked up people that will live amazing lives and there's nothing you can do about it. That's life. It will treat you however it wants you to and there's nothing you can do about it. There is nothing you can do about life. Well, other than one thing. And its starting to seem like more and more of an attractive option. I hate school, I hate work, and I hate life because that's what life is. I want to live in a world where I can do what I want. A world where I truly have control over myself and there's no way ill ever achieve that. Its complete nonsense. Im describing a fantasy world.

Bye. Time to leave this place once and for all."
1981,I am over the line,"Throughout high school until now (2nd year into university) I've grown more detached of people, all the dirty practices they make, all the pretenses they keep up with to attain personal gains. Ive grown tired of it. At the time I was doing self harm, the usual cuts on different parts of my body, it was a case of attention grabbing at first, but it developed to the point where nowadays theres not a waking moment where I fantasize about killing myself / killing others. Ive already tried killing myself through pills, (overdose of beta blockers) didnt work. I knew the location of a revolver inside my house but they put it away in another part and I cant seem to find it. I'm mentally scarred from some things I've watched, things that disgust me to my rotten core, things that make me go crazy with fury, rage and sadness. I just want this to end, like plugging a computer off.  


As many others, the main thing thats keepign me away from killing myself is the pain, and possible extra suffering I could pass through, since where I live there is no really 100% painless and quick way to kill myself.  


My thoughts torment me every moment of my day, I cant shit at peace, I cant eat at peace, I cant hear music at peace, all I feel is the urge to vent my anger, to kill myself, to explode.....I just can't anymore...."
1982,Help,I feel like ending it all no matter where I go I can’t escape getting mentally bullied by everyone when I get home and talk to my parents they don’t help they make it worse and I don’t know what to do anymore I feel so bad and I know other people here have gone through so much worse but I can’t get this feeling of guilt and exhaustion I want to die so badly but I know it would hurt others but I can’t do this anymore I need help can someone help I get rejected by everyone and I’m a loser
1983,why am i not dead yet,i really really really really really really really really want to die i have tried to kill myself a lot of times but i never end up doing it so if someone can kill me please tell me because if i died i don't think any would even care or notice anyways i am always just there watching other people have their amazing life with all their friends when the closest thing i had to a friend was my boyfriend but he cheated so now i have no one
1984,"YouTube, LiveLeak, TickTock or...?",Where is everyone posting suicides these todays? Live prefer but also upload. I have Googleed but not political acceptable now these days only phone number. Please to add direct the link?
1985,I'm actually done,"I want to kill myself. My patents wont stop ramming it into me about grades when I SWEAR TO GOD I try so hard. I'm crying as I write this. My parents don't care. Why do they care about my grades more than me? I want to die, I want to die, I want to die ahtuejfjsosjfhsocjsosorjdhfjs"
1986,Existence is pain.,"Existence is the only actual problem for me. Evrything else like “my gf left me” “my mom died” is for me bullshit. I don t wanna live anymore in a fucking absurd universe where we don t even know wtf is this all abiut. And i think suicide might be the key. Besides that i am 19 yrs old internatinal student, studying at a university in Sweden."
1987,Been suffering from some god awful virus and no doctor knows what it is,"I can barely move my mouth, my skin is revolting, I'm too weak to stand, etc.. I've never felt any illness this horrible before and it's making me feel so helpless. My life has been so fucking miserable every fucking day and now this.. It's too much. I don't know when it will end. And if it does, I'll just go back to being depressed for the usual reasons. I feel like I'm being given multiple signs to just fucking kill myself. I have so much medication now and I just feel like I should take every single pill along with my antidepressants and maybe even my old prescriptions I don't take anymore, too. They're all in my room. Maybe this is my sign."
1988,Outcast,"It just doesn’t make any sense to me that if life is always going to be a constant battle for survival then how is one supposed to relax? I just don’t see how this constant chase of fulfilling my body’s desires will lead to my freedom. This world is a shithole and I’m supposed to be fine with everything and conform to whatever bullshit I was born into? Lmao fuck that, life should be 100% without suffering/pain because I see nothing good/useful that comes out of being hurt. I’m in a constant state of anxiety and just thinking about jobs, money, socializing, etc. makes me want to run away from everything. There’s just no hope for someone like me because being an eternal outcast is my destiny."
1989,Contemplating,I think I'm gonna try too kill myself tommorow. I'm just not happy with the way my life has been going. I'm tired of being a burden on everybody's shoulders. I know my family would be happy if they wouldn't have too deal with me anymore. Just tired of my heart aching all the time.
1990,Ready to try again,Yeah. I’m at that point where I’m so mentally damaged so I’m gonna try again. I pray it works this time.
1991,Private Rooms,"

I have these medical records, now, that are shot through with these references to being depressed, because if it came up when someone took my medical history that I had spoken to a therapist I always said 'depression' when asked 'what for?' because you can't just say 'I would like to talk to someone,' there has to be a 'thing' and that was the one I was given, whether it was true, then, or just helpfulness, real concern. I might have been, once, mildly, before, I don't know. Really, though, it's easier to say that then tell some new person what I wanted to talk to one about.


I have the right words now, short and discrete, ever since the investigation by the licensing board into that therapist for what I should have said, a neat summary they returned when I explained. 'A difficult time, personally.' Some things that went badly that I very much wanted to talk about, briefly, and some options I was weighing up. A what next, or what instead. I had all these choices.


I had friends and family, but these were private things, and things about which my friends, my family, had opinions and I already knew what they would likely say and the idea was, I remember knowing back then, or thinking, that therapists are trained not to have opinions and it was fine to use this service if you needed it. Now I have, because I once went and saw one once and got worse, a 'history of major depression,' even as they dutifully record what happened that this 'worsened it.'


There are several things I can now say that counselors, psychologists, professionals will reliably react to in among everything. Opinions. Of the various opinions he slowly introduced its the ones on my friends and family that give the rest of them pause. Telling me to break ties with people. End relationships. Stay away from people.


It's odd that this is the one they react to, because there's usually a lot of generally awful things for one person to do to another that come out first but this one, it cuts through like a scalpel. An absolute prohibition. All the rest they emask about, assume, like it's no big deal, like of course what do you expect.


I had at least one friend who knew I had been seeing a therapist. My ex-boyfriend, breaking up with whom had been one ingredient in the 'difficult time,' personally. A man who wanted children at a time when it started to be true that I might not be able to have them. We were friends, starting a while after, a good couple of years. When I got sad, withdrawn, started talking about 'not being sure what it was like before but I want to say this is worse,' he told me, helpfully, full of concern, I wasn't like that before, categorically, and to' please go back to a therapist,' when I had only seen the one, I was still seeing him, and that the 'before' was before him. 


By then I'd probably used this word, depression, so that's probably what he was seeing. A 'relapse' when I had never been like that before. Had never been like this before. When, when I asked him, later, coming up to the interview with the licensing board, he said he thought I was 'remarkably well-adjusted,' before all this.


I keep getting told that I did the right thing in reaching out for support, after such a 'difficult time personally.' It's the sort of thing a well-adjusted person does.


Except now I have this 'history' when this is the first time it's ever happened to me.


I used to have a lot to live for, choices to make. I had an incredible career. I had friends, I had family. I had rotating roster of hobbies and I could cook. I was going to buy a home.


Now I have my old, ever-lasting ever-rolling lease. Now I have almost no money to pay the rent, but not yet none. Now I have an opportunity to stand on my feet for 10 hours at a time to not as soon be on the streets.


I can't go back to what I used to do. Ever. So I looked around and applied and I got into law school. So I don't know if I can afford to go, but this job, these ten hour blocks on my feet, if my legs can take it, on my might get me closer, a job of the type I can work while I study. I haven't accepted yet but I go to the welcome evening for the new student, a suggestion from a helpful lady ad the admissions board to meet my peers, ask people already studying what it's like.


 I go, and I stand at the bottom of the stairs and I hear their voices talking, and I see the first face in the room and I start crying again, like I have been almost non-stop for coming up to four months now and eventually I give up and go home. I have seven days to decide and then my offer lapses and it's another year, or something else, or nothing.


And on the way it occurs to me that this means, too, I can't do this shitty job, this standing all day job. That even if I can stand up that long at a time I can't stand up in front of people, crying. That I can't even do that.


I used to say that what would always stop me were my friends and my family. Not so much any more. There aren't so many, any more, but it isn't just that. It's not being able to live just for other people. I don't think about them the same way I used to and I'm tired. I can't always tell how I think about people is me, and how much is him, literally clapping his hands every time I behaved badly, every time I pushed someone away. I can't say how it happened how many times I argued with him when he told me I was a victim, I was perfect, and I told him it had never defined me, and that nothing is as simple as all that and he worked so hard to convince me.


Sometimes it's like being alive is this room. Sometimes there was a party, once. There were good bits and there were bad bits, but the party's over. Everyone's gone home and there's no reason to be in that room any more. There's no reason to be there any more. There's nothing I want here and nothing I'm needed for and even if I was, I'm tired and I just want to leave.


Sometimes the room is just a room, and sometimes I remember what happens here.


Sometimes I have a bad day and I can feel something that feels like my insides being torn apart and all I can do is cry.


Someone asked me if I'd feel better about what happened to me if there was justice for it. 'Yes,' I said.


'No,' I corrected in my head later, 'but I might feel better about having to keep on living.' I know I'm not supposed to want to die. I know that this is the ultimate proof I'm ill and I don't know, I don't know about that so much any more.


And it isn't 'justice for it.' It's 'knowing it won't happen to someone else again.' Justice doesn't mean anything to me. I'm not who I was before and what's left, what's left of me only wants to let go.


In a way it makes sense. He worked so hard to make a victim out of me. To encourage me to act like one, to think of myself as one. It is a certain kind of justice that says he should have to wear that script, that script that can only reverse itself and attack a real or perceived or designated attacker instead of just living, the best you can.


I called up my friend, who I had dated, to ask questions coming up to the licensing board meeting and it turned out that we hadn't been talking long enough, or in a way, that meant he thought we were out of touch, and he told me, rapidly, while telling me he didn't want to be talking to me, just because it was complicated, while talking to me, that he was seeing someone and that something, unspecified, was weird for him, to have me around and it's all I really wanted for him except now I'm in this room again, with a designated purpose and it turns out that all anyone had seen in me was a romantic object, no matter what anyone said.


And eventually he said something to me, something that didn't mean what he thought and I got frustrated, and I turned vicious, like I never would have, once upon a time,  and he said he couldn't believe he had ever wanted to help me, and he wouldn't co-operate, hours before that interview. And this, this might really be the difference between it happening again and it not.


And I know, I know he has his own version of that conversation, too, and I wouldn't want to drag him back to it.  And I don't know, for sure, how much is 'me' and how much is this script I was fed. I didn't think I believed it, but I don't know that there's any difference between the two any more.


Without this help, there may be no justice, but more than that I know, knowing too much about the person, it will happen again. I don't understand how anyone could let it, knowing, understanding what it was. Tall to those people who aren't me. Tell them not that I was depressed, but what I told you about what happened to me, to confirm it as best as can be what happened in a private room with no witnesses. To confirm that what happened to me, did, and what it did to me.


Maybe he never saw it that way, all the time. A depressed person, being depressed. Maybe noone will ever see it. And it will happen again.


I had a bad day today. I had one of those days when I can feel that thing, even before I couldn't go into that room, that new room, with those people who could be my new peers, and it occurred to me. Not just that I want to leave the room, not just that I want to die, not just that there's nothing on the other side, but this, these words:


'I'm not going to make it.'


One day I'll have one of these days, or another of the other kind and I'll be able to stand up long enough to act. And I won't make it through that day. I want it to be soon.


It used to be that other people were what stopped me. Leaving them alone, hurt, and carrying this. It doesn't work any more. I stopped caring the same as I stopped caring about everything else.


Now in an absurd and selfish moment the only thing that stopped me, last time, was realising that if I did what they'd say, like Robyn Williams succumbing to depression when it was dementia, but different, that I had this history of depression, that's what happened to me. That who I was and what happened to me disappears under this word. An internal fault, always there.  I suppose that is a sense of justice, for once, that made this enough to stop, that once. I suppose I'm still fighting him rewriting my past to suit, rewriting my present to better match or more easily provkde what he needed to at the time or just some fantasy, some over-wrought imagination tinged with arrogance never questioned. Maybe just the arrogance that sees a certain person, a set of labels and needs them to be what that person is to make sense.


Maybe I was depressed, after my 'difficult time personally.' Maybe I found myself trusting not a predator but a man who was delusional. Who really thought he saw in me what he wanted, the only world he himself knew, or some grand florid fantasy he could arrange and none of these stop him from doing it again. He told me, among the things he shouldn't have, enough that I know he will, even if he really thought he was being helpful in telling me how it really was. Showing me. Or just not wanting to be alone in his own, very private room and pulling me into it.


I suppose it's true of many that the circumstances of their death erase who they were. That I already knew, had noticed, that when someone finds it about one of the people I have known who have died their first and last question is 'how did it happen?' I suppose it makes no difference, really, what they'll say about me, because the whole point is that I won't be there to hear it.


A homeless man came up to me as I came back from not going into that room. He asked for change and when I went to check, like I always used to, and I still do, he said most people didn't even look up. I only had a twenty and I gave it to him and he was delighted. He had almost a room for tonight, he said. Almost enough.


I don't know that there is real justice in this world. I don't know that there being so would make the difference to me.


Once or twice I bought a lottery ticket with a former friend of mine, to be companionable. They used to say that it was an exercise in assisted dreaming. That they knew they wouldn't win, but they used to buy them and picture what they'd do if they did. It never worked for me. I put the ticket away and not think about it. Then when it turned out, as of course it did, that I hadn't won, I would for a second dream - what would I have, if I had?


For a second it was like that, here. What I could have had if I had won, would win.


Today it doesn't hurt, it's that room again.


I would like to know that someone knew who I was before all this.


I would like to know that it won't happen again.


More and more, I just want to leave the room."
1992,My partner is suicidal and I don't know where they're at,"I will be (A) and my partner will be (B). I'm trying to keep as many identifiable details out so bear with me

We have been together for a few months now and up until these past few weeks it has been wonderful. A few weeks ago my partner opened up about a drinking problem and sought support. B was doing well until early last week and they spiraled, speaking of suicide and wanting to just run away. I urged them to get help.

Yesterday I got some messages that B has called their parents and that B is suicidal. Last night I got a text saying that B is at the hospital. This morning I get a phone call that B is on their way to the hospital again. That's the last I heard from B. Assuming that they're at the hospital I called them and the hospital has said that B hasn't been there since last night.

My only friend in town is on her way to take me to B's house to make sure the worst hasn't happened. I don't know what to do from there. There doesn't seem to be a guidebook on what to do for a suicidal partner and I have only been able to support B based on my own experience with suicidal thoughts. Because of my experience I tried to just be present and let B find their own way because a suicidal person can only get help if they're open to get help, right?"
1993,I think I'm gonna do it,I've tried but nothing in this life makes me happy. I thought having a good job and having my own place would make me happy but always having to deal with my toxic ass gf everything was just worse and I hated my job. So I quit my job like a fucking idiot and now I'm gonna get evicted soon cuz I cant find work and tomorrow I have to give my phone back to at&amp;t cuz I cant pay my bill. All the while the girl who I was dating is still my roommate and still toxic as fuck and makes me feel like I'm under so much pressure not only to support me but also to support her. I really try to be kind to people and do people I care about favors but for some reason all I ever feel is selfish. Non of this would've happened if I would've just kept my job. I'm tired of the pressure and I wanna die but idk how I'm gonna do it yet.
1994,I’m just a burden to everyone,"21 year old NEET and living with my mom and when I’m not doing that then I’m couch surfing at friends places but I can tell everyone is getting tired of me. I just leech off others and they’d all be better off without me. I take and take but never contribute anything to this world. I don’t have a job due to social anxiety or whatever it is, don’t have a car, girlfriend, or any hobbies of any sort. 

All I do is stare at my phone all day and watch YouTube, I’m pathetic and I just wanna end it at this point. I want to change but I can’t. I don’t have the energy or willpower to do anything and I wouldn’t blame my mom if she were to kick me out soon. I’ve been unemployed for years and I don’t see my situation getting any better. 

I’m so tired of this miserable existence and I’m not sure I can make it much longer. I’m just a burden and I let people down constantly. It’s laughable how bad my life has gotten in just mere years. If I had a gun I would’ve ended it by now, I guess I’ll have to find a building or bridge I can jump off of or something because I just can’t do this anymore. Sorry to everyone I’ve let down, I wish things could’ve been different"
1995,Don’t know how much longer,My life has been absolute shit since a kid. I been alone since I was 6 years old and I’m 20 now and life has gotten a little better than what it used to be like (I really don’t feel like typing up a whole sob story) but this depression and pain I hold in my heart is too much. Only thing stopping me is my girlfriend and my brother. I can’t even treat my girlfriend right. This voice in my head keeps telling me to kill myself every single day and I feel like I’m getting closer to doing it. I’m a piece of shit. I’ve done things I wish I could take back and I’ve hurt families. I’m stupid. Useless. And pathetic. I hate saying these words a part of me doesn’t wanna believe it but it’s true. One of these days I’m gonna blow my brains everywhere and I’ll be at peace. Total peace. I pray to god that things get better but I gotta make things better myself. But I just can’t. I feel so numb. So alone. If it was easy to take my life I would have done it already. I’ve got a place to do it and everything. I’m just waiting for the courage. God please help me.
1996,Should I call 911 if I'm feeling like harmimg myself/killing myself,I'm a minor my family is asleep I don't want to talk to them about how I'm feeling I'm scared they'll be pissed if I call 911 since I'm feeling suicidal. Please answer
1997,Thinking about ending all this.,"Hey guys, I’m new at this but the thing is I never thought that some day I could want end my life.

This whole thing started after I broke up with my girlfriend... I’m not seeing any point in keep living without her, I’m not seeing any reason why should I keep loving myself since I might never be with her again...

I’m thinking about this too much I kinda have it planned, I’m thinking about throwing myself from a building and the only thing that is stopping me form doing it, is just because I’ll meet up with her next week and I’ll try to get her back, but at the same time I’m thinking that this won’t work and she will say no.

And if she says no, I don’t know what to do with my life and probably after this I’ll jump."
1998,Just feel like I can't do it anymore,"On mobile so sorry for shitty formating or any mistakes.

I've tried really hard to get better and to improve things, but no matter how hard I try nothing ever works out. I'm genuinely starting to believe that I just wasn't meant to be happy. I'm so tired and wish my life would end already than spend any more years miserable."
2000,My mom passed away and I want to end my pain.,"My mom passed away a few months ago so suddenly and unexpectedly. She was only 55. I’m in my early 20s, I still need her. The pain has been insane. I don’t want to live in a world without her. 


I know my dad and siblings are and will always hurt too. But I watched my mom die and every time I close my eyes I am back in the hospital room with her. 


I find peace in imagining myself committing suicide. I think I will soon."
2001,Is a box cutter sharper than a knife?,
2002,An Uninteresting Title.,"I utterly hate my life. I honestly don't even know what to do at this point. I want to die but my step brother killed himself and I don't want to put my family through it.

 My family consists of a sister whom I hardly get along with, a father I don't talk much to, a mother who really isn't and never was a mother, and a nana who sends random memes everyday who doesn't understand quite how depressed I truly am.
 I've spent many days after work just sitting trying to muster the motivation to do something but cannot. 

 I had an ex that ruined me financially whom I put first completely, this resulted in me losing many (all) of my friends (if I even had any let's be real). 
 I use weed (Canadian so it's illegal not that it matters anyway) to pretty much ignore my life. I am out of weed and honestly don't feel comfortable driving atm due to some crazy suicidal thoughts. 

 I've been depressed since I can remember and self harmed quite a bit in my younger years as well as a few times in the more recent years (23 years old). 

I'm very tired of trying, I'm tired of not having a family, I'm tired of being lonely.

I feel so guilty about everything because everything's been blamed on me my entire life (my mother literally blamed me for my parents divorce when I was 12 or 13).

I've fucked up everything I've ever had or done. 


I really don't know what this post will even accomplish. Hope you're entertained I guess🤷‍♂️"
2003,Im never good enough,"Everything I do in life is never good enough for my parents. I am in HS and part of IB, I've been destroying myself to please my parents, but my best is never good enough for anyone. I scored a 1510 on SAT but my mom wanted a 1600. She enforces a strict curfew but I don't have enough time in a single day to complete all my homework. So my grades falter in return. In the past 2 weeks because of finals and IA submissions I wake up at 2 in the morning to complete all of my assignments. I don't have the energy to keep going anymore, ive noticed ive been participating in suicidal tendencies unconsciously. For example, I had spent all my saving on Christmas gifts for all my friends (about $700) and left nothing for me. I don't feel like killing myself, but I think about the sheer bliss of death when ever a long lecture occurs in class. I've made multiple attempts at talking to friends about how I feel but im afraid to truly open up. I live a fake life at school, I live vicariously through my school persona, a smart and put together varsity wrestling player, but this life is too much for me. I can't maintain this facade at home, I spend most of my time doing homework while praying that some event would come up and temporary close down the school I attend. But I go to school anyway, and struggle through all the tests and tribulations. Only to return home to get lambasted by my mother-- who ""loves"" me dear-- for not getting all A's or not living up to my sibling's splendor, living day by day giving my all to have my mother be proud of me, just to find out that she told my relatives that she has nothing to be proud of and how useless I am. For all my childhood ive been told this but now more than ever I'm actually starting to believe her. I feel like if I were to just disappear my parent's woes would be banished alongside me. I feel as if I am the harbinger of disappointment and failure wherever I go. The only one I can kind of trust is my girlfriend, but even she knows not my true figure. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if I seem spoiled, I mean I have everything one could ask for yet I lack happiness. The thought of suicide lingers in my head but I still contemplate whether my current condition warrants such brash and rash actions."
2004,What do I do?,I just got tricked into seeing a real suicide video and I can't get it out of my head. It's just the way it happened was horrible. I won't go into detail but it was horrific the way his body just layed limp. Idk how to stop thinking about it.
2005,About to pull a Juice World tonight.,Dueces ✌️
2006,almost got arrested,"i've been dealing with a million things at once lately. i have bpd and major depression and have been going to therapy since i was in high school several years ago. i've had many abusive relationships that all ended badly, people have hit me and touched me and used me. my parents don't even believe my therapist when she talks about the things i go through, and because they are anti medication my mother tells me things like how my meds are poisoning me and making me worse. i rarely leave the house cus of my low energy and the fact that they guilt me and make it very difficult for me to even hang out with friends for a day. 
on top of it all i'm gay 
 and my parents are not open to gay people at all. and i've hidden it since i was 12, not that well but the best i can under the circumstances. 
recently my sister came back for holidays and it's been very difficult to deal with her. she's condescending and mean anytime i say something, she sucks up all the attention i could get. she used to hit me when i was a kid, and my parents didn't believe me when i told them that, and when i said it would be very hard having her here for the whole holidays. i've been pretty much crying and having breakdowns every other day. the one time we got into a fight recently she told me i would be stuck living with my parents forever, which then ended with me throwing soda at her, and her grabbing me by the neck and pushing me into a wall. my parents witnessed it, and i got the blame for the entire situation. and that's how it's always been. 

today i got caught shoplifting and was almost arrested, i got let go without charges because it was my first time being caught for anything illegal. it made me truly realize there's no place in the world for someone as broken as me. no one really cares what you've gone through. if i can't get a job or have any 
aspirations for myself at all what's the point. i'm useless as a human. i don't want to be apart of such a cruel and unforgiving world anymore. i'm tired of being scared and of feeling like i'm rotting inside. i know if i would have gotten arrested i would have had the guts to do it. i know if i was born in the past i would have been locked up in some hospital forever, and i almost want that. i just want more than one person to truly care and i've lost all hope of it happening. i want to be normal and enjoy life. 
 i know living isn't supposed to be easy, but it shouldn't be this hard. i long for a safe loving home that doesn't exist. i want to be free."
2007,I need assistance urgently.,"Am going to be frank. I am a colossal pussy and want to die, however i don't want to experience physically pain at all. Can anyone please advise me onn how to commit suicide painlessly. I am looking to kill myself over the weekend or even today depending on how speedy the replies are and how effective the killing methods are that are suggested by you lot. 

I have searched all over the internet and I have seen some suggestions. I am currently learning towards helium. However, am not completely convinced. If you could give me any websites or tips on how to buy drinks from the dark web that would help me commit suicide I would really appreciate it."
2008,I miss my Mom,"I haven't talked to her in over a year. I don't come from a rich family. My mother slaved herself to afford a good life for me. I've achieved absolutely nothing in the last few years, all while exploiting the people around me for their time, money, attention. I've since cut off contact with all my relatives and friends. I've kept one friend, in another country - to keep some semblance of normalcy, but as amazing as she is, we're not close and we don't talk much.


I've planned my death every year during the holidays. I'm not Christian, and since moving out, this has been the only guaranteed alone time for me in the year. But every year, I would eventually get too scared. And decide to wait until next Christmas. And cry myself to sleep.


I miss the people I've lost. I moved out of the house at 16 - I never saw my little brother grow up. I used to read Harry Potter to him every night, doing a different voice for each character and trying to scare him during tense moments. And then I left, and when I came back, he was towering over me. 


I was the oldest. I got the best things. Best gadgets, best opportunities, all the praise. My brother was raised like the step sister from fairy tales. Except he was loved. Very much. I feel like I've never showed it to him. The idea was that I'd get successful, and take care of my family and my sibling. I've wasted all these opportunities. And my brother is amazing. He is a history buff who can tell you the most random facts off the top of his head. He writes short stories. He's a theater kid, and he's amazing on stage, from what I've seen on facebook. I keep thinking, had I left earlier, he would've had a better life. Sometimes I think I'm scared to die, because I won't see what he'll turn into. What if he ends up just as messed up as me?


My family's not affectionate. All the i-love-you-s from my childhood were said sarcastically, even if genuine. But once, when I was 7, I got told off. It was something minor, but the adults just lost it. And I remember sobbing in an empty room, and thinking how unfair life was. Then my Mom came in then, gave me a hug, and sang to me till I calmed down. And everything felt right. 


I want to call her. Tell her I messed up. At everything. That I'm a failure. And I want her to tell me it's okay, that she'll fix it and everything will be right. But it won't. Because I'm not 7 anymore.


When I make small talk with strangers, they ask me about my family. I have to lie about the calls I've had with my Mom, how weird my Dad is and what a geek my brother is turning into. It hurts even more when I have a funny story to tell or a sarcastic remark my friend would appreciate, but then I remember we haven't talked in months, and they've blocked me long ago."
2009,I want to die for the dumbest reason.,"And its fucked up for the people who have real problems and here I am wanting to not wake up next morning because I think no one will miss me. I have done nothing ever in my life that actually means something. Life would be better for everyone around me if they didn't need to worry about me. Mom and dad wouldn't need to waste their time or their money, my sister wouldn't need to skip work in college to talk to me, and my friends wouldn't have to hear my annoying voice anymore. The only reason I don't jump off the bridge next to my house is because I feel like my problem isn't a real problem, other people about to commit suicide should be helped rather than me."
2010,I got taken to a hospital,"On Wednesday, I wanted to kill myself so badly that I even took a knife and I placed the tip against my chest. I decided to give life one more chance by contacting childline (for those of you who don't know, it's kind of like a hotline for kids going through pretty much anything bad). I told them that I have a knife and I'm planning on stabbing myself in the heart. They said they were worried about my safety and said that they want to call emergency services for me. I don't know if it was cowardice or if I genuinely didn't want to hurt those around me (which is the reason I told the doctors) but I agreed and gave them my address. An ambulance came and the paramedics couldn't have been nicer. They were amazing and made me feel safe and cared for. This was the same for the A&amp;E doctor although not as much as the paramedics. The problem was when I saw the mental health person from the A&amp;E. He just kept asking questions as if reading from a checklist and I didn't get the feeling he cared at all what happens to me. His body language and tone also made me feel like all of this was my fault to the point that I believe that now, despite how many times did the paramedics and the A&amp;E doctor tell me that depression is just like any other illness and is in no way my fault. 

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist on Tuesday and after my experience with the mental health person in the A&amp;E, I'm really scared about what will happen."
2011,I hate safety,"My house is so safe. My parents have all of the razors hidden, all the accessible pills arent lethal and any other method of suicide would be too slow and i would get found by the many people i live with. i would turn to my friends, but i made the mistake of having a load of friends so now i dont have any close friends who i can rely on. ive tried going to my school and they didnt do anything. even though i know it isnt true, it feels like nobody cares about me and yet they still dont want me gone. i had a few days off school recently and everyone seemed to notice despite nobody ever talking to me usually. i wish i had some way to die and end my lifes torment but every way is unreliable and dying would ""be a waste of my potential"" which i cant even live up to thanks to my constant stresses and worries.

It seems so nice, death. just an emptiness. it would be better than this pain that will never go away. i dont want to die necessarily, but i dont want to be alive. if there was any other option i would take it in an instant, but for now i must settle for waiting for the day when safety isnt ever-present."
2012,Where do you go,"I keep seeing people say, ""Don't do it. Listen to your heart and mind, they'll agree"" or something. What if your heart and mind are fully in agreeance that suicide is the best option for you and everyone around you? What do you then, especially if your brain is overpowering any doubts your flawfull emotions make?"
2013,People like me are never meant to experience Love and Affection.,"What's the point of living if no one can love me because I look absolutely disgusting? I dont think I'm ugly, I know it. I know that looks influences everything so that's why I have nothing. No friends. Only bullies, liars, and my dysfunctional family. I need love but no one cares about me. I've lived my entire life being shunned and harassed by everyone around me..."
2014,My (24M) gf (23f) just broke up with me after i travelled halfway across the country to visit her thus spending a fifth of my lifelong economy.,She was my everything for the last 4 years and now i just want to die.
2015,I don't want to live anymore.,"Nothing I bring to the world is positive. I am a burden on everyone. I tried writing a longer post but my phone crashed. Ask me for details or I'll debunk all your cliche ""look on the bright side"" replies."
2016,Hurting is the most painful thing in life,"There’s just something different about being hurt, after so much years of coping and dealing with depression you never truly learn to cope with being hurt. And the only thing you ever find peace in doing is hurting yourself more to try stopping the emotional pain because physical pain only last a little. Emotional pain is forever."
2017,I just don't know what to do anymore,"I've tried therapy, I've tried meds...I always end up here....  
I don't have any plans for life...no ambition....  
My girlfriend, who is also suicidal is doing better off without me...I don't have any friends really...  
The thought of ending it...just brings peace....that's all I want..."
2019,Planning to die in January...,"Title. I just don't want to do it anymore. I'm so tired.
I want to overdose on January but I'm still figuring some things out."
2020,Went from Ivy league graduate to collecting unemployment in 2 years,"The job I got out of college was in an industry where three learning curve is very steep, but the company who hired me was willing to invest in my development. Well, my division got sold 1.5 years after I started, and it feels like having 1.5 years of experience in this industry is the same as having 0. My entire life is falling apart. I just want to jump and melt into the concrete."
2021,i wanna killlll mysellfff,helppp
2022,Waste,"I don’t know how to keep living.   My mother just said that she regrets ever having children.  I understand her.  I have caused her so much pain. 

This semester I retook an English class for a third time.  I barely passed with a D.  I struggle with ADD so school/focusing/completing work has always been difficult.  My mother spent the semester helping me stay on track and helping with time management.  She worked so hard to ensure that I could be successful.   Without her I would be a failure.  

I didn’t finish the first major writing project on time and got a zero.  I spent the rest of the semester lying to her about the nature of the situation and giving her false hope.  She thought I was going to get an A.

The truth finally came out a few days ago.  I broke her heart, and have ruined our relationship.  She will probably never trust me the same again.  

I hate having to hide how bad things are at school every time I’m around her.  It’s always because of my choices.  I have yet again ruined the holidays.

She is so devastated and I cause so much pain.  I have no redeeming qualities.  I come off as rude, lie to and manipulate my family, and am wildly unsuccessful in school.  I’m the funny friend now, but in a few years, I’ll be the real joke,

I’ve had suicidal ideation for years.  Anytime depression is brought up at the doctors/therapist I brush it off or fake my way through counseling until I can get off the SSRI’s.  I hate the way they make me feel with my ADD meds.  I have never been truly open with any therapist or counselor because I feel like my own pain is deserved because of the issues I’ve caused.

I think about ending it all every day.  I have never self-harmed outside of skin picking and pulling out my hair.  I was going to cut a few hours ago because I wanted to punish myself for how much I hurt everyone.  I wanted to feel the knife in my skin.  This was the first time I’ve ever done something like that but I stopped because I was scared.  

I am so lonely but I hope no one ever has to live with someone like me.  I have never been able to imagine a future for myself.  I don’t feel like I have an identity.  I barely have any passion for anything, just some “sort-of” interests.  I will graduate hs soon and am not likely to be accepted into any colleges.  I don’t want to spend 70+ years alone, but I am too toxic to be around.  The only thing holding me back from killing myself is my family, but each day alive is like a kick in their stomachs’.  What is the point?"
2023,I’m ready to leave,[deleted]
2024,idk what to do please help,[deleted]
2025,"I tried and failed, and now I don’t know how to feel.","A week ago today I woke up and had no idea what the day had planned for me. So my boyfriend started the day off by fighting with me so I told him I need to be alone for a bit to think. All of these memories of traumatic experiences from my life came back to me, all I could think about was the negative things I will never get an apology for. This led to cutting, usually that numbs me and I’ll stop crying, but these thoughts just kept getting louder and louder. About a year ago my boyfriend was prescribed mirtazapine for his insomnia, I took the bottle away from him as I thought he would try to overdose (the irony). So I took a mouthful and tried to lay down to sleep. My boyfriend was worried nonetheless as I wasn’t answering my phone anymore. He rushed home and called an ambulance. This whole experience has crushed my soul. How could I have been that deep in my thoughts? How could I have gotten to that point of no longer caring about my own life? Yes I have struggled with depression and had an attempt when I was 16 but other than that I had (at least thought) I was happy. Waking up after thinking it’s over is so... diminishing. It felt like I had failed another thing, the one thing that would end all my pain. I have continued to struggle day after day since this happened, and I’m terrified to be alone. I don’t know if i’ll do it again, but something deep down is telling me I will. I don’t know what to do anymore. I need someone. Anyone. I’m sorry this is so graphic but I needed to get this off my chest. My own parents don’t even know..."
2026,"I tried to hang myself , but I'm not ready to tell anyone","Life is falling apart, and I just feel hopeless and ashamed.

Yesterday I tried hanging myself. Spent all day testing different configurations and methods.

On one ""test"" I felt myself starting black out. I aborted the test, but realized I had a shot at making this work.

A little later I was trying again.  Felt myself blacking out again. That time I leaned into that feeling even harder, and pushed all my weight into the noose.

I woke up moments later, not sure where I was, thrashing around wildly trying to get the noose off. I was doing a partial suspension, and I think I kicked up off the ground somehow which caused me to wake up. In was in the middle of slipping around trying to get my feet on the ground, desperately trying to get the noose off, that I realized where I was and remember what I had been doing.

Got free and paced around the room. My overwhelming feeling was not of fear, but a resignation that, ""I can do this.""

Immediately wanted to call some people and tell them what I'd done, but I don't want them to know.

I have a mild bruise near my larynx and a little bit of pain when I swallow, but not much else.

Last night I woke up and had a panic attack, felt like I couldn't breathe. I've never had a panic attack before.

I want to try again, but I'm afraid I'll panic this time, or fuck something up and go through that experience again."
2027,My dog has cancer.,"So, a few days ago, we've pretty much confirmed that my 12 year old black lab, Bella, has breast cancer, and as is, it's spreading fast.

While she isn't my first ever dog, i lost my first back when i was 10, so i can't say i remember that one as much as i do with her. So, in a way, she feels like my first. 

She's like goddamn family to me, and she's been with me through my darkest times. And despite her age, it still feels like she has so much life in her yet. But we're thinking of putting her down relatively soon, before she... isn't herself anymore 

I was... very much passively suicidal, back then, not really caring whether i'd live to see the next day, feeling like a burden to everyone. 

She was the one that got me through it, and while i feel better about myself in comparison now, i feel those old thoughts of mine creeping back now that i know she doesn't have much left.

Sorry, just needed to vent somewhere... It just doesn't feel fair that someone like her has to die when she's still so full of life and activity as she is. And i know that i rationally couldn't have done anything to spot and prevent it, there's still the damn feeling that i've failed her. But for now, i'll do what i can to push those thoughts back, and just... enjoy our last time together. I can at least give her that much."
2028,Is it mostly planned or impulsive?,"Do people plan out suicide? I feel like my life will end at a moment's notice, maybe having a note ready would be good. Today I hit a hight of emotions and impulse I was sitting at my table running a extremely sharp pair of scissors across my wrist just waiting for that extra bit of whatever it is to make me push down.

 I feel like that's how it's going to end for me, just a big fuck everything and do it."
2029,I Don’t Want To Live Anymore,"I have Asperger’s syndrome, and I don’t want to live anymore. My family doesn’t want me. I don’t have friends, and no woman would ever lover me. I can’t get a job, not matter how hard I try. What’s the point of living?"
2030,There should be a network that connects suicidal people with professionals which allows them to pay the professional to kill them and make it look like an accident.,
2031,I’m sitting down with my family tonight to tell them I‘m sick of being alive and really just want to die.,"I was hoping for a little advice/suggestions? I’m in the middle of coming off antidepressants so my brain is scrambled eggs right now and I don’t really know how to talk about it.

For some backstory, I’m a 37M and I’ve just recently been diagnosed as high functioning autistic. It is for this reason I’ve stopped taking medication (on the advice of a doctor) as I’m not so much depressed as just wrecked after a lifetime of struggling to fit in to society’s expectations of me. I’ve never felt like I fit in anywhere and with the current political climate I don’t feel like this will change in my lifetime. I can’t hold a job and the whole make money, settle down and make a family model doesn’t interest me in the slightest.

I have wanted to kill myself for so long but the thought of hurting my family stops me every time. I feel I need to make them understand that I’m only alive so they don’t get upset, not because I have a plan for myself and want to live to a ripe old age. 

I know they’re not going to say “Well shit, you should totally kill yourself then.” To be honest I don’t really know what I expect to get out of telling them, other than just being open and honest about what’s going on with me."
2032,I deserve death,I am a terrible terrible people who deserves to die. And I want to die so I guess it all works out.
2033,My best friend died and I’ve decided I can’t live anymore,"This is more of a good bye  then anything, I have good life and such but I just can’t keep going, I have to put a stop to this"
2034,This was my suicide note from 6 months ago. I thought my mind was getting better and it’s not.,"Thank you to the people who have showed me love in this life and allowed me to become a collective piece of everyone I’ve encountered. It’s beautiful that each person you meet and ultimately love, that you’re able to find pieces of yourself in them; pieces that last forever and traits that you wouldn’t have been able to find on your own. It’s beautiful that you leave some of yourself behind when you meet people; whether its a brief encounter, intimacy with another, lifelong friends, parents, siblings, etc, anytime you’re able to impact someone, it sticks with them. That’s how I feel. I was able to meet and love all of you so much that I took pieces of you and made them part of myself. Thank you for that. I’ve lived the best life possible. I did a lot of the things I wanted to do and maybe in the next life I’ll be able to do even more. It’s hard to say for certainty what the right time is but I believe it’s the right time for me. 
People like to say it’s the easy way out, and it might be, but not everyone is strong enough to have their heart broken over and over again and put it back together by themselves.
Be aware. Be aware of the people around you. Be aware of their feelings and when people pull away. It’s not easy to ask for help. It’s damn near impossible most of the time. Our world today is filled with people who brush off the signs because they don’t understand. They brush off the signs because people like to exaggerate for attention, leaving the the people who are struggling alone. Loneliness seems to be an inevitable variable in our world today and it shouldn’t be. Solitude is necessary but so is socializing and talking. If this sparks any conversation, it should be realness. Real feelings need to be shared and real conversations need to happen. Sadness is okay to talk about. It’s okay to say that you’re feeling sad. It’s okay to say that you can’t get up. It’s okay to live in filth as long as you talk about it. Don’t make your friends turn to strangers for help. Don’t make your friends feel bad for habits they can’t control. 
It’s easy to get caught up in our own lives and forget that other people have shit going on too. Everyone has heavy shit going on and if you don’t, and your mind is right, REALIZE HOW LUCKY YOU ARE... to have a proper mind.
This is my choice and my choice alone. There are no faults for what is going on in my head and it pains me that I wasn’t able to get my shit together long enough to help other people get through their struggles. My only regret. Otherwise, I lived fully and loved endlessly - maybe that was the wrong way to live. Maybe that’s why it had to end. I’ve given all the love I have to give; sometimes to the wrong people, most of the time to the right people, but always love nonetheless. 
This isn’t sad. This isn’t the end all be all. There’s more. I’ll be back in one way or another. 
——————————-
I wrote that 6 months ago. I wanted to die and I got a phone call that made me want to wait. I gave life a shot again and I thought my mind was getting better but I’m back in this hole. I think about dying everyday. It used to be the major inconveniences that set me off but now it’s any little thing that doesn’t go to plan. I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m numb."
2035,"I’m a waste of space, so it’s fine if I’m gone","I want to die so bad, but not to end the pain or anything like that. I’m just a waste of air and I feel like I’m not needed anymore.
Sure, I do feel pain and that may be part of the reason why I want to die, but nobody cares about me. If someone did care, I wouldn’t, but nobody does, so what’s the point in living? It’s just never ending exhaustion, unbearable stress, severe anxiety and social isolation because of aspergers. 
Yeah, maybe in the future I will meet someone who does care about me. But they’ll be losing so many way better candidates for love if they date me, so I’m doing a favor for them too.
I’m just not that strong and I’m too indecisive. I’ll never make it in life because of that, so why not stop the inevitable pain right now?"
2036,would this combo kill me,"50mg oxycodone (opiate naive)  
3000mg acetaminophen (Tylenol PM)\\  
45mg meloxicam   
200mg sertraline  
bottle of vodka  
one fat blunt

im thinking the oxy is what's going to make this actually work. I plan on starting with the blunt to calm me down a bit, then to the oxy, then as much alcohol I can drink at once without getting sick. then all the other pills, then just smoking and drinking until im gone. would nicotine do anything too? I figured not but I'll prob have a smoke too idk

any information would be helpful (im p tall and weigh about 190/200)"
2037,Heroin I got some Heroin today and a needle etc and I want to overdose. I am worried if I survive what effects heroin has on you? What is the best way to use heroin. I have never used any illegal drugs but I'm pretty fucking desperate and want to make sure I do it right.,
2038,Done.,I’m so done with this flesh prison and all it’s problems. Time to ascend into the void. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ I’m finally ready.
2039,"I'm not ready, but it's time","No one will know I'm gone. I won't get an obit or a death notice anywhere. Hundreds of people die each day with no one to notice and now I'm one. I never thought I would be, but here I am.

I had to tell someone, even anonymous strangers. 

xx So long, world."
2040,Dark humor?,"People are always like “listen to that little voice in your head” bro that mf wants me to kill myself 

This makes me laugh but it’s true and idk"
2041,Urgent please,Suicide hotline hung up on me please someone help
2042,I just wanna die today...,I don’t wanna be alive I just can’t keep ‘living’. How do yall do it? No fear? No anxiety? Like happy ppl What the fuck!?!??!
2044,I just need to tell someone,"I've been suicidal for so long. I thought it was just a passing phase. I thought if I just tried harder it would get better. I thought that if I downloaded the materials and read the articles for self therapy, that I could be okay again. 

&amp;#x200B;

But today I realized that i've never been okay. Not as a child, not as a teen, and not as a young adult. I've never been okay. I've been a burden to my family. I've been my romantic partner's worst mistakes. I'm a horrible, toxic person who pushes everyone away from me with my toxicity. And i've been told as much by several people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a plan, I don't have a date, I can't see myself actually doing it. But i've written my final note a billion times in my head. Thought about prepaying for my funeral. I hate myself. I hate my life. I have nothing. I have no future. I used to think that I wanted to grow up to have a family and then I would feel good. But i've learned that i'm not cut out to be a mother. I'm a horrible, cold person. I make everyone around me miserable. 

&amp;#x200B;

The people who I live with, and love, become so sick of me eventually that they scream at me in anger when I share my feelings. They wonder why the fuck I can't just be a normal person. They wonder how I can be so goddamn selfish, so childish, so stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother should have aborted me. I should have never, ever thought that I could be some different person one day in the future. This is me. It always has been, always will be. I'll never be okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

No amount of therapy is going to fix me, and even if it helps I can't afford it. I'm delusional. I'm irrational. I'm a fucking horrible bitch. I have ADHD, BPD, and i'm pretty sure i'm OCD. Who would want a mother like that? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to die, but I don't want to live anymore."
2045,I'm not needed,"I was just reminded of this by someone. I'm not needed. She (not the someone. This is somebody else) doesn't need me. She has a boyfriend. Other friends. Family. Me existing/not existing wouldn't make a difference to her. Well, except that me existing would make her feel worse because she could be having a nice day and then she'd have to think about me.

This is true for everybody I know. They all have replacements for me. They have other friends. I'm not good at anything either. I'm a failure in life. So I don't have any particular skills that would make me useful either.

I don't want to hear about how nobody really needs anybody, and we should form our own meanings in life. Or I don't want to hear about how I'm still needed by my parents or something... I'm tired of platitudes. I'm tired of hearing the same shit over and over. I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't know why I post in this subreddit. It doesn't make me feel better anymore to know there are others out there who feel the same way as me.

I'm worthless. I hate myself. She doesn't need me. In fact, my existence could make her day worse. That's true. I'm glad that someone reminded me."
2046,My mom told me my dad has been texting her yesterday and is having suicidal ideation,"I'm going to try to keep this concise. I'm 26 and live about an hour away from my parents who are still married and live together. My dad is diagnosed with depression and is a recovering alcoholic and is 16 years sober. He has a history of cocaine and painkiller addiction but has been drug-free for well over a decade. He also has strong traits of borderline personality disorder and bi-polar II but has not been evaluated or diagnosed. 

He has a history of suicidal ideation with a plan but since he's been sober, these thoughts have been present (or at least vocalized to anyone) for many years as far as I'm aware. He told her that he feels like no one cares about him (has always had trouble keeping friends and family due to his stormy relationships). My mother tried to comfort and cuddle him to talk last night but he refused to talk and said he was sleeping. She went to work today and got a text mid-day from him saying that she must not care because she did not check in with him. They have a rocky relationship. She called a suicide hotline and they told her that the only thing she can do is to be supportive and if she senses a crisis to call 911, which seems fair to me.

  
She thinks I should reach out to him and express my concern, and I'm fine with doing so if that's the right thing to do, but I also fear that this could make him feel like my mother breached his privacy and could upset him more and make things worse. Is this a good idea? If so, how should I approach him? I'm just not sure what my role should be or what I can do to help him. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you guys."
2047,Feeling Hopeless,"Reddit seems like the best place to anonymously vent to so here I am! I'm a senior in high school and thinking about the future makes me want to throw up. I used to be so excited about college, but now I am thinking about how much debt I will be in. If I don't take out student loans, I'll have to go to a shitty state school seven hours away. The only person I really care about in my life will be staying in my home town so I can forget about forming a life with that person. I honestly think about blowing my brains out because I am dreading the rest of my life. After college, then what? An endless 9 to 5 and living for the weekend every week? I know I'm a stupid seventeen year old, which makes me feel even worse. If I can't even handle *high school,* then how am I going to handle *real* problems? I went to therapy for two years to work through childhood trauma, but I feel like I'm just permanently fucked up. My coping mechanisms are intermittent exercise and constantly smoking weed. I really don't foresee myself being able to handle life so I rather just end it sooner rather than later. Fighting anxiety and depression is completely exhausting and I want to give up. How can I be enthusiastic about life?"
2048,I can't fucking do this anymore.. I'm sorry..,"I'm too much of a social reject. I can't even say hi without feeling like an idiot, so that leaves me with not being able to have friends irl. So many people think I'm a weirdo and test my limits when I did absolutely nothing to them. Most of my friends are from social media websites, but I mean hey, at least I feel wanted and loved somewhere.. sometimes. I'd normally vent to them if ever I feel like shit, but now, it just feels as if they're tired of my problems, tired of my complaints, tired of my constant crying, tired of me, tired of my pointless and meaningless existence, so I just keep my cries inside and act like life is full of smiley faces, sunshine, and fucking happiness, even if it hurts me, just so I don't annoy them. In all friend groups I'm in, I'm always the least favorite kid. The kid that barely anyone talks to. The kid that bores everyone. The kid that can't fit in no matter how much I try. All I ever wanted was to fit in. I know some of you are gonna say things like, ""But standing out is better than blending in"" or some bullshit like that, but I mean fuck, standing out will just end up in me getting constantly fucked around with.

I've had multiple suicide attempts because I couldn't stand living anymore and due to the fact that my life will never go anywhere. All it will ever be is a huge cluster of failures. To this day on, I still can't stand being alive anymore. I really would go end my life, but there's a few things stopping me from doing so. My mother, she's always been there for me when my life would be on the darker side, and I'd hate to leave her in this cold, heartless world. My best friend who's been with me since we were children, she's basically my other half, she never failed to make me feel less of a failure, even though I really am and same as what I've said about my mother, I'd really hate to leave her as well. And the final thing that's stopping me from ending my own life is because I'm scared of death. I get it, it sounds ridiculous, but boy does it really fuck up my mind. If these things weren't in the way, I would gladly do what it takes for me to quit breathing."
2049,I just need someone who undertsands..,"Its so difficult to explain this feeling i have. Somehow i really really wanna die, but i cant. I have a responsibility. I have a family to think about, but sometimes it really wish nobody cared. 

I have this crazy hatred to myself. I noticed that I’ve started hitting myself in the head without even noticing. If I’m frustrated about not being able to do this and that for example. Im failing at everything, im one big fucking failure and i dont wanna be like this, but i feel totally out of control. Its so frustrating being unable to control your own life, your feelings, your mood, i cant even control my own actions anymore. Im just a shell forced to live in this cruel world. I feel like nobody and its so terrifying!! I don’t know who I am anymore..  

I wanna talk, i want help, but i dont know what to say or do. I really hope someone sees this... if you are reading then thank you very much for paying attention to me. Maybe you understand, I hope so, I don’t.."
2050,I'm just a stepping stone,"I'm someone who loves to help the people I love better their lives. If I have the finances, I help. If I have the time, I help. And it seems that all of my help does one thing: gives people the stepping stone they need to reach their best life. And once they reach it, they dont need me anymore. 

I've helped people get to their best life. But I'm here struggling, going into bankruptcy, barely able to make ends meet and still feed myself. 

People I've helped are getting fucking vacations in Mexico and I'm struggling to get by. 

I'm glad I have a purpose, I guess. But I'm tired of being used and not getting anywhere. I guess I dont have what it takes to be a success even though I can help others get there?

What's the point though? I'm not a fucking doormat. I dont have anyone anymore cuz they're all too busy with their lives. I'm always the first to send a message to anyone nowadays. I hate this life."
2051,I keep telling myself 'it's going to get better',"Everyone always says 'time heals'

I just wanna give up. I think about it every single day. I don't want to feel any more pain."
2052,Feel like there's no point in living but I'm scared to actually die.,"I'm hopeless. I had braces taken off when I was 18 and told to wear my retainer for a year, which I did and then I stopped. 

I was told wrong. You wear them for life. 

I wish I knew this as now I'm in constant pain with my mouth because they've gotten out of alignment and I'm biting my cheeks and tongue at least once a week. 

My mouth is so sore right now with 2 canker sores where I've been biting my mouth. I can't afford braces again as much as I'd like too without saving up around 1500 first so I can afford the monthly finance. 

I'm lost for hope because I work part time and I can't afford to save up at the moment 

Life doesn't seem worth living."

2058,I only want to feel comfortably numb,"I am not joking. I would like to have that sentation of peace pictured in that song. Due to some circumstances, I am willing to die. I usually ""joke"", as a coping mechanism. I really need someone to talk to.

Thanks for your attention, wish you have a good day, and you fullfill your plans"
2059,I've Finally Made a Plan,"I'm a worthwhile person. I deserve to be loved and happy. If I was the kind who enjoyed being alone, I probably would be. But I'm not and no matter how much I try to force myself, I will never be that way. I feel I've done everything right. I tried therapy (a waste of money that shouyld've been better spent helping others), I tried the ""suicide hotline."" The AI bot sent the police to my house and I was arrested, beaten, then left cuffed to a bed in a psych ward for 72 hours. When I got out, I was missing my two front teeth and my jaw was broken. I lost my job and without insurance, I couldn't afford to get it fixed. I lost my ability to smile, to speak, and live with constant pain. But I've tried each day since, always holding on to the belief that it would eventually get better. 

But the hard, bitter truth is this: sometimes, it doesn't. For many, it does, but not for everyone. I slipped through the cracks and I'm finally done with existing. 

No one will know I'm gone. I won't get an obit or a death notice anywhere. Hundreds of people die each day with no one to notice and now I'm one. I never thought I would be, but here I am.

I had to tell someone, even anonymous strangers. 

xx So long, world."

2061,I'm on the ledge,"I legit spent today reaching out to every fucking resource and there was no response. Makes me feel even more worthless than normal
."
2062,Please help me before I get insane,There is no such evidence to me being watched but I simply cannot stop thinking there is always someone. In school behind me. At home behind me or in some hidden cameras. Bathroom. Shower. Toilet. Bedroom. Kitchen. Everywhere. I go to school but look around 3 times every day to confirm I am not being followed. This has been for months. Maybe years. Also cameras. At home. On my phone. On a street. Anywhere.
2063,"Small crisis, I don't think I'll make out of this building today.","If I do manage to get myself under control today, I might post again here because suicide has been present more and more in my mind for the last few months.

There are no suicide hotlines that work from where I am, and I'm tired of telling my story because no one believes me anyway. I shouldn't go home tonight at all. my partner is there with my family, waiting for me, I don't want to see them. I don't want to be me, or be here anymore.

A friend of mine tried eloping as an alternative to suicide, he failed miserably and I fear I might as well. I don't have enough money to go on on my own without probably starting to become a sex worker on the way, and honestly... I don't want to be alive anywhere else. I don't want to be alive here even.  I just want to dissolve, and leave nothing but air behind.

It will hurt, but it's the only way. No more moping around, no more self harming to cope (started to do it a month ago, won't do it again), just pure sheer willpower.

2067,I'm so tired. I can't keep doing this.,"I've wanted death seince I was 13, and the feeling has not changed at 23. I don't know why I want to be dead so bad, I don't find happiness in anything. I havent for years. I've tried everything, the medication, talking with several people. Non of it helps. I've tried killing myself 3 times in the past but never have the balls to do it. Recently it's starting to feel easier. Like I'm slowly letting go of the will to live. Feeling this way has taken everything from me, my jobs, my home even the only woman who ever loved me. I just want it to stop. I just want the fighting in my head to end I can't keep going. I'm so tired from fighting if I should live or die. I wish someone would just end it for me or to have the balls to end it myself. Nothing makes me happy and I don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore. I can't keep doing this I just want it to end so bad. I don't know what to Do. I don't want to do anything anymore I just want it to stop. I don't want to wake up I'm losing control and I feel like I will end it soon. I don't see the point of continuing anymore."
2068,I didn't ask for this,"I dont care anymore man i want to die. i /want/ to get better but if youre just going to call me whiny i guess ill just bottle everything up again and wont tell anything about myself to anyone. once im 18 i can kill myself and ill be free and theres fucking nothing you can do about it. not that you give a shit. i wont talk about my pain or feelings anymore, is that good enough for you? am i low maintenance enough? dont worry, ill be out of your way soon enough. i didn't ask for this body, i didnt ask for this life, i dont want to be here! its incredibly selfish of you to keep me here, i dont get a fucking choice in *anything* not even my fucking brain and body im so sick of this. im so sick of ecerythig. i just want it to stop. all i want is to be like everyone else. i just want to be functional. i just want to be happy. i just want to be cared about and loved."
2069,Heavy Bag of Feelings,"I'm certain many of you can relate but does it seem that feeling suicidal comes with so many other emotions? I'm extremely anxious, stressed, paranoid, distrusting of the world, etc. My mind feels so hazy at times due to not being able to fully grasp what's going on around me. I heavily medicate with alcohol, which has led to quite a few problems with the law (dui and violation of probation). I can't focus at work and feel like I'm living a life of lies since almost no one knows what's going on, which means I can't confide in them how I feel. 

Personally, I already have the means of my departure readily available. I just don't know how to convey to those closest to me my feeling of regret and sorrow for failing them. And for how much I want to make them all happy, I'm going to be selfish here and say that they don't get to decide whether I live or die, that's my right."
2070,I think I’m done,"In the grand scheme of things, my problems are quite small. I constantly beat myself up over feeling down and suicidal, because it shows weakness. A sign that I’m too mentally unstable to handle everyday problems that afflict most adults like me.

I’m 25, and I have Asperger’s. Social interactions and even my day job depress me greatly. Just taking to people, normal conversations; they stress me out to no end.

Recently, I’ve felt unappreciated at my job. I can tell most of my co-workers don’t care for my dismissive and cold attitude. They call me shy. They want to help, but I refuse to let them. I’m always so determined to fix my own issues. Not wanting to reach out and get into a therapy session with a co-worker. They have problems too, and I find it easy to vent but hard to listen. My brain just shuts everything positive out. Like my body just wants to stay complacent, stubborn, and shut off.

I’ve had countless moments like this one. I’ll come home, and just drown myself in sadness. Overthinking every detail of my life, and finding no joy in simply existing. I want to die, and my brain immediately finds peace in that thought. To just not exist. To return to the nothing that I came from.

I don’t even know why I’m on this sub. Maybe a small part of me thinks that miracles can happen, and that I’ll be scooped up from the darkness, brushed off, then sent over to something better. Something more stable.

I don’t even know if there is any help for me. Suicide hotlines have proven to be difficult for me, as if talking to a random stranger online is going to fix my problems tonight.

I was born defective, and I feel like that the world just screwed me over so that I can fail where many others succeed. I want to die. I want it to be over, and I’m tired of sitting around, waiting for a miracle."
2071,Why am I here,"I don't want to be on the planet anymore, I don't want to waste my life living. Why do I have to do that same thing every day if I'm just gonna end up dead? I don't want to worry my friends and family any more than I have to.  I think I might end it soon, around Christmas."
2072,"""You're gonna die anyway, why not live?""","Something that a lot of people tell me is that because death is inevitable, there's no need to rush it, I should just live out the rest of my life and die naturally. That is some of the faultiest logic I've ever heard.

I hate being alive, nothing makes me happy and I will never feel safe or loved and I'm only 21. The average lifespan here is 80, why the hell should I subject myself to possibly 59 years of hell when the last five alone have made me try to kill myself? That's just asking me to prolong my suffering for absolutely no reason and zero benefit.

And it's not like things will just magically get better. Getting better takes work, time and effort and I'm never going to have the energy to heal. Unless something completely unexpected, outside of ny control and likely borderline supernatural happens, I'm just going to be miserable and alone until something finally kills me.

Why subject myself to all that when I can kill myself before I hit 25? Unlike the vague, empty promises people keep making to me in a futile attempt to get me to not off myself, suicide is a concrete option with a clear outcome that will objectively resolve every single problem I've ever had cause dead people can't have problems."
2073,My mom never fucking listens to me and I genuinely want to kill myself because I can’t take this goddamn constant pressure to be a functioning adult when I can’t be.,"I have told my mom countless times that I can’t drive because I disassociate at least twenty times a day for up to two hours at a time, and that I can’t get a job because I have such a low will to live that I wouldn’t be able to keep up on my work or bring myself to even show up to the workplace. 

The first problem is not the biggest deal, I can have friends give me rides places, or hire an Uber(or similar) service to get around. But it the second issue that is the worst thing. As far as I know, I don’t qualify for the disability thing where the government gives you money if you can’t work because of a disability, but like I said, I would never be able to even GO to my workplace, let alone do work, and this wouldn’t be able to keep a job. 

Yet despite these reasons, which I should mention she finds valid for OTHER PEOPLE, she still insists that I’m a lazy piece of shit who uses my anxiety and depression as an excuse to never do things. 

So I’m fed up. I don’t know how much longer I can take this."
2074,I kinda wish I had done it,"First of all: I am better now... kinda. But thats the point. I dont feel lost anymore or down. I kinda feel nothing. Mostly because my life got really boring. I have no motivation for anything and just go about my day. Wich is better than before but it kind of sucks even more. I am sometimes thinking back to that one day I felt unbelievable down again. There were like 4 people who could have texted me and I would actually get up for them but for everyone else I just did not care. Fortunately actually one of these people (a friend and former colleague) actually did texted me and asked if I just want to come around. Have a chill evening. Talk a bit. So I forced myself to get out of bed and give this day a better ending (I just did not wanted to dring alone I guess). I was there. It was chill. She is cool! But it got late and I wanted to go home especially because I hate sleepovers. At the end of the day I want to be alone in my room. Problem with this whole thing is that I live in a suburb beside a big city. At night there a no trains going back there so I always have to take a train to the next suburb beside mine and then walk 45 min. I did that a lot. Was a good time to think but sometimes exactly that was just too much. And in this night my thoughts went kinda far. When I was at home my face already was kompletely wet from my tears. I had trouble breathing and moving because I just felt so hopeless. And then I thought ""Okay... I dont even care. Fuck them all!"" I remembered all the strong painkillers I still had from my wisdom teeth removal (for some reason it did not hurt at all so I did not needed them). Also we have this whole cupboard in the kitchen full of medicine and medicals stuff since my mom is a nurse. So I opened the champanger bottle we still had and started crushing a lot of this medicine and putting this in a glass of water. It was pretty strong I would say but... I never drank it. I chugged the whole bottle of champanger and just sat down staring at the glass. And in exactly THIS moment the friend texted me again something like ""Hey it was nice to see you again. We should do this more often."".
Well and this is the closest I got to suicide. It was also the time where Keanu Reeves was pretty big in the internet and I heard that he had to face a lot of struggles in life too. He is still standing on a stage and making jokes and I figured this is who I want to be no matter if I will kill myself or not. What would people say about me now if I kill myself? Probably something like ""Oh no we love her! Why did she do this. Oh no!"" but I dont want people to be able to say anything when I kill myself. Call me arrogant but when it comes to my death I want everyone around me to suffer! i want them to break down because this time for real no one expected it. And everyone thought I would be the strong one. This is what I want but for that I first have to be that person! My life is not worth dying for yet. Sounds weird and it is but I hope it is understandable. I still wish I had done it tho."
2075,A life I don’t want to live,"If you’re planning to read. Let me warn you, it’s long.

Many people, specially at my age (17), have fear of the future. Everyone at any point in their lives wonder and maybe fear the feeling of drifting into uncertainty. I do. So, so much. 

Its very common to say “huh, I honestly don’t know what the heck I’m doing” and laugh it off. But at some point I got stuck. Now that uncertainty and phrase are leading me downhill. 
I live in the past, and without welcoming new situations. At the age of 12 (more or less) I started to feel afraid of growing up. Then I started loathing it. 

Being taller. Seeing my friends, acquaintances and my surroundings morphing into something so different and distant from me. Pass to 5th grade, to 6th grade, to middle school and making it into high school. Everyone kept moving, except for me, and I was- am, being left behind. 

I came to realize after getting into middle school that I was and would be forced to live a life I didn’t mean to have. To carry and tolerate people and situations that would turn and are turning into a really heavy burden, just because “that’s how life is”. 

In primary school I was just a shadow. People were aware that I was around but didn’t mean nothing to no one except for my family and  three close friends. (Now in hs I do have more friends but I just know I will eventually drift apart and I will be alone, as always). 

“You are almost eighteen. You have to do this. Or do you want to ruin your future?” , “You have to choose NOW. Or it will be too late” They tell me.

What if my life is already ruined and I don’t know it. Nah, not true. I just KNOW it’s going to be in ruins. People with degrees end up jobless of miserable at what they do. Many people live an empty habit of going to make a living of something they do not enjoy, but have to do because money is everything in this world. I don’t want to have that existence. 
I am weak and incompetent. I lack the necessary personality and skills that are a must in this place. I will end up crushed. 

I don’t want to grow up anymore. I don’t welcome this– to be forced and dragged to make choices that often leave a sinking and painful feeling full of “what if...”. To accept that numbers in school will define my happiness and future. To let go of places or situations that make me feel safe because everyone else thought it was a good idea to take away from me because “that’s how life is” and “life is about changing”. 

I hate how time is going on and on and on. I want to stop aging. I want to stop everything. And I don’t want to see anything or anybody leave me. I have to leave first, so I won’t suffer more than I already am. I want to be 17 or 18 maximum, forever. The only way I won’t be having a miserable adult life is just if I don’t have one. 

And I’m not brave or strong enough to make a leap of faith. Any failure crutches me, even if it is just a little, insignificant thing.

I can see it coming. I will eventually hit rock bottom and I will end it all. Everything will go dark either in red water. Or with my feet dangling in the air, if I become desperate enough.

Sorry it was so long. I just wanted to vent a little. It helps a little to say some things."
2077,Feeling Worse Lately,"Honestly, I've been feeling a lot more suicidal lately. Going to bed every day hoping I won't get up, thinking of getting killed, jumping off of bridges. I don't care, but my two friends do. I promised them I won't kill myself, but since then I've been thinking about dying in my sleep or in an accident or getting really sick. But at the same time I feel like I should be happy and thankful for my good life, I just got a puppy on Monday but I'm still not happy. Sorry for bothering everyone, I just wanted to get it out..."
2078,This is my life now.,"I have no bladder, no prostate, and no job.  I may or may not still have the cancer.  My piss leaks out of my body and pools up in a bag that I have to tape to my side.  This is my life now.

My son cries and looks away whenever my wife is in the same room as him.  While I was in the hospital she left him alone in the house, by himself, stuck in his crib, with no food or water, for a full day, and then she stole his dinner.  When I finally came home from the hospital, he was crying on the floor with a dislocated elbow while she was lying on the couch watching Tik Tok on her phone; she hadn't made him dinner because *she* wasn't hungry.  He's woken up crying and screaming every night since I've been home, screaming loudly enough that you can hear him from any corner of the house, and she dozes through it.  This is my life now.

I'm not supposed to lift more than 10 pounds for the next month.  My son weighs 28 pounds, and there's no way in hell I'd trust my wife to lift him (nor is there any way in any hell that she would want to).  Same goes for walking the dog, changing the cat litter, shopping for groceries, and any and everything else around the house.   My guts are on fire and I am afraid the surgery site could rip open any day now, but if I don't do it, it doesn't get *done*.  This is my life now.

My wife has all the money and controls whether we will have food to eat or lights to see.  She has all the power and she knows it.  She neither talks to me nor listens when I talk to her.  She does nothing around the house or with our kid.  She could have added the kid to her insurance but doesn't want to, even though doing it would save us almost $1,000 each month.  That is the level of contempt she has for me and her son; she would rather burn her own money than take any action to help him.  Every now and then she will grunt and shove me for not being able to read her mind and give her exactly what she wants at the moment, and then she will cry crocodile tears and I will have to spend the next hour consoling *her*.  This is my life now."
2079,It is so hard to keep friends,"Everyone just ends up abandoning you at some point. Then they hate you and talk about you right in your face and make instagram posts about you on their stupid spam account. Im trying so hard to keep it together and not go back to idolizing suicide but the fact im usually by myself ,emotionally, and in every single way, everywhere, makes it really hard.  Everyone else has so many friends. All everyone cares about is themselves and how they look in front of everyone. They only want to be friends with people who are cool and cheerleaders and popular. I dont fit in any of that. I feel so alone in this world and as much as its cliche to say, no, no one does care about me and would miss me"
2080,This holiday season could do me in for good,"Finances are insanely tight and because I'm pathetic and have no job or education that matters, I'm a burden on everyone around me.

I ask my mom for help and she refers me to Google (said to Google low income services). Well, I tried that and it wasn't helpful. I don't know what to make of any of it. I'm so scared I'm shaking.

You know, it seems like whenever I feel I'm making progress, something happens that throws me back to suicidal thinking again. Like now with the holiday season. There isn't enough money to pay rent, to eat (I'm so hungry right now), to even go out looking for a job. I'm totally stuck and I don't even know what to do. I'm so freaking scared. And I didn't particularly enjoy life to begin with. It's a struggle to go on every day. My one comfort is that I am mortal and i don't have to kill myself in order to die. It will happen eventually. That's my biggest reason not to commit suicide - that and my cat. But I cannot afford my own life and I can't make it work for me. I would love to have a job, but apparently I am weak and pathetic and can't handle the real world, even at 34 years old. Sometimes, I think that's because of being homeschooled. Sometimes, I think it's because I was isolated for most of my formative years in a dysfunctional household. And sometimes I wonder if there is just some problem with me that the therapists never identified in time.

When I ask people online for help, they ask ""Don't you have family/friends?"" And no.... I don't. I've tried reaching out to people, but I think I might be ""one of those people"" (as my dad used to phrase it).

But the bottom line is that not even my own mom will help me out. And it isn't that she can't help me out. She could, if she chose to. Just like she could have visited me anytime in the past 3 years if she chose to. But instead, every year for the past 3 years, she has gone to Europe to visit friends. And every year, she tells me the same sob story of not having enough time or money to be able to visit me - but she says maybe next year! I shouldn't care, but even if I don't care, she is still my mom. I;ve only seen her once since my dad passed away. And the things she said to me right after he died and the things she did to my brother... I just... I feel that lost my whole family when my dad died.

And now I'm nothing but a burden to the rest of the world. And despite all my efforts, now it seems that even though I'm not as suicidal as I used to be, I can't afford to be alive. And if I die now, that means a lot less hunger pain and a lot less fear. I don't want to live a long life if it's full of fear and hunger and so much uncertainty that I might be homeless tomorrow, or next week, or the week after. At this point, I'm just done. I'm tired, I'm hungry, I don't have it in me to keep on keeping on through all this. If that means I'm weak, then so be it. I'm weak."
2081,What to do when you refuse to get better?,"Hey, sorry if this is awkward, this is the first thing I've ever posted on Reddit.

tl;dr - ""I would do anything for love, but I won't do that...""


I have been casually suicidal since I was 16, having days where escapist pursuits successfully distracted me from my despair, and other days when all I could think of was how I would kill myself right-then-and-there in that instant if I had the means. Truthfully, and as cliche as it sounds, the only reason I haven't so far is that my parents would be sad. They deserve better than to learn that their child has killed themselves, but I can't keep myself alive just on that guilt.

I've spent the last 22 years thinking about suicide almost every day. And all the arguing, all the negotiating, all the rationalizing, all the coping, and all the pondering has led me to one inescapable conclusion. I don't want to get better. Not really. It hit me one day when I actually thought about a colloquialism I use frequently, ""I would do anything for..."" and I realized, not only was I not willing to do ""anything"" I wasn't even willing to do most things. Basically, nothing. I've lived my life as a passive entity only moved by existential inertia, making no real decisions, somehow lucking into a life others might _actually_ do anything for, but I am only existing, not living.

I am controlled by laziness and fear. I am afraid of everything and too lazy to do anything other than try to run away and hide. I don't live, life happens to me. I exist only in my comfort zone and every day it gets smaller and smaller.

I don't like pain. Any kind of pain. It is that, primarily, which has kept me alive for as long as I have been because it limits my self-termination options significantly. I don't like physical pain, so opening my wrists and bleeding out is a no-go. Hanging, forget it. Falling from a great height, far too much time for the desired effect to arrive. Drowning, no way, no how. Traffic collisions, that comes with a host of other problems. Overdoses, too unreliable, and I don't exactly ""know a guy"" who could get me some carfentanyl. All of it is off the table. It's firearms or nothing. Highest probability of success, least amount of time to regret my decision or even comprehend that the action has been taken. Sure, I could screw it up and somehow survive, but the odds are in my favor. Fortunately, living in America, it's basically my god-given right to obtain a firearm for the purpose of shooting myself.

So, when I am suffering, my unconscious starts asking, ""what can I do to stop this."" I am embarassed by my body, but I am not willing to devote the time, effort, and associated physical suffering, to exercise and improve it, or work on things like improving my skin, teeth, hair, etc. (yet I will watch youtube videos about improving those things). I am embarassed by my social shortcomings, but I am not willing to devote the time, effort, and associated emotional suffering to practice and get better (yet I watch social improvement videos on youtube). I am embarassed by the atrophy of my mental faculties over the last 20 years, but I am not willing to exercise my mind by reading books, studying philosophy, or altering the lens through which I view the world (but, and I'm sure you're noticing trend here, I sure seem to watch an awful lot of youtube videos devoted to those subjects). I am unable to cope with my lack of control in the world. I cannot suffer the truth that the selfish and unempathetic continue to trample the disenfranchised, and while I tell myself ""I am beyond frustration because I am powerless to do anything about it,"" I am far more upset by the fact that ""there might actually be something I can do about it, but I am not willing to do it."" I'm not rushing to Hong Kong to provide support in whatever humble way I can. I'm not doing any political activism, canvasing, or voluneering. I'm not helping the homeless, battered women, abused children, abandoned animals, victims of social injustices, the drug-addled, or helping steer the youth in a positive direction; but I allow all of those things to weigh on my soul to its crushing point.

I am keenly aware of a multitude of things that I can _try_ to change my life for the better. But I refuse to do them. It is effort. It is pain. I am afraid of failing, and I am even more afraid of succeeding. It turns out, the one thing I am not willing to sacrifice to fix myself is my current identity; the lazy, simpleton coward, who I am so ashamed of that it makes me physically sick to my stomache to acknowledge. I have wished so many times that the ""me"" and the ""me that I hate"" were separate entities so I could perpetrate violence upon it with all my being. That I could cave in its skull with my clenched fists, to turn it to pulp such that I break my own hands in the process.


My innate self-preservation and inexplicable pride cause me to seek out avenues of self-improvement and salvation, but my conscious mind rejects all of it because to acknowledge the need for improvement is to view, in all its corpulent fullness, the disgusting the depth of my self-evident inadequacies. It's like a weird see-saw. Feel pain, desire change, realize that change is pain, refuse the pain of change, somehow oblivious of the fact that stagnation is pain. I don't know if this is a ""devil you know better than the devil you don't"" scenario or if I'm really just stupid. Or maybe it's more like: ""feel pain, desire change, realize that change is pain, realize that even if you go through the pain of change there will inevitably be a new pain on the other side of that so it's really 1 pain vs 2 pain and it becomes simple economics."" Well adjusted people move forward through pain, and when they get to a new pain, they move through that too. Me, I only ever retreat.


Watching a video about exercising instantly reminds me that I will never do it because I am too lazy and selfishly protective of my numb homeostasis. Watching videos about making myself appealing to the opposite sex renders my ego awash in shame and disgust at my failures and the knowledge that not only am I a failure, I'm a quitter too. If people who fall down and get back up are to be commended (or, at the least, not shamed) then the person who gets beat and stays down where it's safe and makes the floor their comfort zone are surely worthy of scorn. Approaching content aimed at expanding my ability to think in matters of logic, reason, philosophy, and expertise only serve to make my mind immediately tired due to its consistent lack of exercise, and the laziness and aversion to the pain of exercise keeps me docile. Knowing that I am so selfish that I would rather lay in bed while my aged parents shovel snow in the drive way, knowing that I won't do common courtesy chores like clean my room, empty the dishwasher, do my own laundry, knowing that I want, and take, the big piece of cake, the last donut, the last soda, and all the other manefistations of my overwhelming selfishness, has led me to not only question my love for parents, but to make me realize that I don't actually love them. They are just enablers of my mental and physical convalescence such that their absence, rather than make me sad, makes me wonder ""who will take care of me."" I will miss them for what they could do for me, how they would make me feel, not because I actually considered their humanity in any way.

I am a wretch. I am disgusted. I am ashamed. And I am not changing.

If continuing in this manner is wholely unacceptable, and changing course is untennable, is there any other avenue but suicide?"
2082,I’m done...,"I posted here earlier about my suicidal thoughts and how people are thinking only of themselves and I’m frustrated as I stay alive for other people to save them the suffering but I just don’t care. I gave things one more chance and began to feel calmer but it’s only gone down hill again. 

I have no one. My girlfriends mum hates me and wants her to break up with me. My mums shelving me off to my alcoholic dad who just shouts at me. And that’s all I have. I’ve tried Samaritans and other crisis groups but I’m tired and I’m done. I want to kill myself"
2083,Please help me before I get insane.,There is no such evidence to me being watched but I simply cannot stop thinking there is always someone. In school behind me. At home behind me or in some hidden cameras. Bathroom. Shower. Toilet. Bedroom. Kitchen. Everywhere. I go to school but look around 3 times every day to confirm I am not being followed. This has been for months. Maybe years.
2084,If the Tories win,"In the general election today in the UK,  I should just die."
2085,This world is absolutely awful.,"I honestly just don't see the point in bothering. EVERYTHING is a lie all spoon feed to us, the government are absolutely nothing but pure evil, we're living in a constant surveillance world, and I'm just so fucking tired and upset. Nothing is true and money has undoubtedly ruined earth. Worse is my fucking grandmother has cancer, but she can't be cured because some greedy sack of shit waste of life corrupt government/pharma CUNT, REFUSES TO RELEASE A CURE FOR THEIR FUCKED UP REASONS. FUCK THIS.

If any government agent or anyone affiliated with any sort of corruption is reading this, do us a favor and end your absolutely appalling life by jumping into a volcano."
2086,Going to Kill Myself this Weekend,I’m a loser with social anxiety and I’ll never find love or have friends. Would rather be dead than continue living this shitty life.
2087,I’m standing at the brink of death,"Everyone that I know thinks I’m a dumb asshole.
I’ve got no one who likes me genuinely.
I’m shit at everything.
I’m ugly as fuck.
I’m suffering constantly.
I’m done."
2088,"I'm a useless, pathetic piece of human filth who should've killed myself a long time ago...","Using a throwaway so maybe there's a chance my family will think what happens to me tonight will be an accident.

 I'm about to lose everything, and in the process bring down what few people care about my pathetic existence with me. After trying to turn things around for the better, I've come to the conclusion that I'll never amount to anything. I'm almost 30 with a bachelor's degree and I can't even get a job that pays the bills. I'm paying for being so selfish, I'm a useless piece of shit who should've killed myself a long time ago when  I had the chance. I was so fucking stupid thinking that I could try and turn things around for myself. It is impossible for me to ever find happiness and I will always find some way to bring others down with me when I fail. 

I lost my job a month ago because my new employer decided that they didn't want to pay my mileage to and from the office, despite their company policy and despite telling me at first that it wouldn't be a problem. I was told by a co-worker that I struck a friendship with that it was because some of the more local employees were upset that I was getting a larger mileage check (not like that extra money went anywhere since it was a 105 mile round trip to and from the office, plus everywhere else.) The thing is, the state I live in has an ""at will"" employment law, stating that employers can hire and fire ""at will"" and for any reason at all. I've been trying to get a new job elsewhere for the past month, but I can't find anywhere that doesn't want me to relocate, and that's not an option for me. Most places where I live are highly conservative with their pay, meaning that my area has some of the lowest wages in the state. And because I'm so ""over-qualified"", no one will hire me for even the lower-wage part-time jobs because they want someone who'll stay around for more than 5 years and don't think I'll be willing to stay that long with my credentials.

So, naturally, I apply for unemployment and put in a shit-ton of applications everywhere. Everywhere I call, ""we're on a hiring freeze, we'll keep your record on file,"" or ""we're automating and downsizing our staff, but we'll call you if something opens up in a couple of months."" My morning routine from Monday to Friday (no one ever has hiring managers work Saturdays or Sundays around here) has been filling out applications, doing phone interviews, and traveling to personal interviews. On top of that, my attempts at starting side gigs have all fallen flat, because everything I touch just seems to crumble in my hands.

I tried doing videography and photography with my camera, but while getting ready for my first gig, the camera's motherboard fried. Turns out there was some kind of rare error that was causing this, and my camera happened to be affected... I can't afford to put down for a new camera because I haven't had any income coming in for over a month and a half.  Next I tried doing yard work, but nobody around my area wants to pay anybody for raking leaves. Finally, I tried selling stuff on eBay, but I had a buyer rip me off and in the process, I lost the item, $250, and I was banned from selling on the site... Finally, I've been doing side work for two years as a remote editor for a couple of small to moderately sized YouTube channels, however with the big COPPA scare, they've all closed up shop, and I can't find any other YouTubers who'll hire me because they're waiting to see how COPPA and the new regulations are gonna change the site next year. Also, no one in my area expects to have to pay video editors here, and nobody really has any use for them.

I posted on here months ago under another account and almost went through with killing myself then, and I thank you guys who talked me out of doing the deed, and to those that tried to give me hope and talked me out of it, thank you. I tried my damnedest, God I tried my damnedest... to get my shit together, but now I'm about to lose everything and bring so many people who I care about down with me, and I just can't let that happen.  My grandparents have a life insurance policy taken out on me, so I'll be covered for a small funeral. I was originally gonna wait and do the deed Saturday night, but I don't see any point in postponing the inevitable and I'm just gonna do it tonight. I've got a plan to make it look like an accident. And at that, for you users that talked to me all those months ago, I am so sorry it's come to this.

Goodbye..."
2089,I don't care about life anymore,"Im 13 and  have a lot of friends in school, which sounds good so far, but that's the only good thing my life has to offer, which I got myself anyways. Nothing was ever given to me, my brothers and sisters left due to my abusive dysfunctional family being crazy. and since there is a generational gap between us they are in there 20's. I cannot leave with them due to me being 13 and now I'm stuck alone at home (with the crazy abusive parents).  I can elaborate on that if you want me to later.

Another reason (and probably the main one) why my life sucks so bad is that I am physically unattractive, I don't look good at all. I have no real luck with girls and while I have great conversations with them, its like they realize how I look in the middle of us having a good time and just stop talking. Girls and even boys tell me how ugly I am. Even friends I was close with for half of my life tell me i'm ugly. Its just a fact at this point it's said so much its not even an insult, its just a reminder. Usually people get told they were ugly 5 years ago or 3 years ago but they are good looking now, i'm told now im ugly and will be ugly in 5 years. 

My Life is in the shit and I just don't care anymore. I might not kill myself but rather get myself killed. What I mean by that is that I will start doing bad things (That's all I will say so I don't get tracked by the fbi or something). The reason is because I might as well do these things because if I get killed, who would really care? I'm just letting this off my chest before I start, experimenting with my life.  I was dealt a bad hand and now its time for others to feel my pain."
2090,if I check myself into a hospital what will happen?,
2091,Why has it got to be so complicated and hard?,"Why can it not be ‘pick up gun, put at head, pull trigger, dead’? Why can I never be fucking brave enough to do it? It pisses me off. You want to end all of your shit, but your mind just guilt trips you to hell with ‘oh but think of your loved ones and how much they’ll miss you’ and crap, and then you can’t do it because you’re not brave enough and you’re scared. It’s annoying. I wish I wasn’t such a fucking coward."
2092,I cannot stand to be alive anymore,"Hi...  


So i don't know where to start. I'm not happy at all. It's a start i guess. I remember when i was a kid, about 7 or 8 years old, it was the first time i thought about suicide. I was standing on the border of a window at home, i was on the 4th floor and i was thinking about jumping.  Retrospectively i should have done it, i would have spared myself a life of suffering.  


Maybe it comes from the fact that my father was beating my mother when she was pregnant of me. I've been made inside of someone who was suffering, depressive. It's been 8 months that i don't enjoy anything anymore. I live like a machine. From the morning to the evening, i'm in pain. Well, there is a reason behind that. Someone broke my soul. In millions pieces.  I never felt so sad. It was like if all the suffer from my life was coming back. I managed to survive to this, but i'm dead inside. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Even tears don't come anymore. Well...Sometimes....But it's like one tear or two. I'm dead inside. I hate my life, i'm lonely AF. Yes i do have friends, but i don't want to talk about how i feel.  


I tryed to changed my behavior, to reconstruct myself. I try to become religious, i have a new job. But fuck...All i do is doing things because if i stay inactive with myself, i want to die. Like now. So in the evening i drink. I drink so i can start to lose myself and sleep in the best case. I don't see an end to this situation. I was trying to convince myself : Ok dude, with this new job you can in 2-3 years move to another country start a life from scratch in a new environment. But... How can i wait 3 years in my situation. As a day look like an eternity.   


I want to die, but i can't. I don't know why i can't do that. Maybe this is the limit where your survival instinct stop you to make this idea real. I just feel that it won't solve the problem. That this is not a solution. Well, i'm killing myself slowly anyway. I smoke around 60 cigarettes/day. Even at my work an old guy told me "" Please smoke less "". It's ok in my work to take a break often to think. So every hour i go out to smoke 2 cigarettes. It takes me 5 minutes max. And when back at home i'm a chain smoker.  I don't even clean my home. It's disgusting. There is cups of coffee everywhere with cigarettes buts inside, dirty clothes, half eaten food, bottle of wine everywhere. I broke my bed so now i sleep on the ground. I could buy a new one but i don't give a fuck.   


I don't know how to explain what is going on inside me. It's like if i wanted to get out of my body, like if i was trap inside myself. This is an horrible feeling. This is like if my whole body is hurting. Burning from the inside. This is physically painful.  I want to die."
2093,Black Girl suicide pact,"Are there any black girls out here who want to do joint suicide with me? I am a black girl myself, 18 years old, living in Florida. I want to die because of a lot of INTERNALIZED RACISM and for other reasons too (looong story). IDC about your reason for doing suicide, i just need a partner. I'm not forcing anyone to join, I just need someone to do suicide with because I'm too much of a coward to do it alone. REPLY IF YOU ARE INTERESTED."
2094,I think i might kill myself tomorrow and i dont know what to do,"Maybe this is just a final cry for help, but i feel like I'm going to kill myself tomorrow. I keep thinking about it and i have it planned out. Im going to be really honest here and say that i dont want to die, i just want this pain to end. I'm torn between keeping myself self alive for the sake of my family and finally giving up. I want to give up so fucking bad. I dont know what to do. Maybe i should tell someone, but im afraid they'll make me go to the hospital again.

Im at the end of my rope. I've been trying so hard to get better with my depression/anxiety but nothing seems to work. I wake up every morning crying, and I'm still haunted by my past. There's something broken inside of me. It's been that way since i was a child. I'm only 21. Still young yet so ready to die. Inside I'm still a scared lonely kid. Im lost and i dont know what to do anymore."
2095,Lethal dose of diphenhydramine (Benadryl),"Does anyone know what a lethal dose of benadryl would be. I’ve found things on google but they all vary. Would 10,000 mg work?"
2096,"""you will get better""","what the fuck? everything is so messed up and people keep saying this kind of thing, like it's supposed to help in some way. 

i feel awful, and this feeling is getting worse everyday. people say things like ""dude you will get better, u got a gf, and a family"", ""grow up"" man, everything is so fucked up, and i look for the people, and to everyone... i just wanna some nice friends to listen to me, maybe, idk... i think about suicide everyday, and this kinda is fine."
2097,How the hell do you title this shit,"I used to date someone who encouraged the worst behaviors in me. If I didn't eat for 3 days he was impressed. The deeper and more damaging the cuts, the more respect he gave me. I know all of this was wrong. I know that. I just want some god Damn validation for myself and I don't want to have to do that to get it. Most people don't agree with my choices which doesn't bother me most of the time but some days, when I'm already sad, I just want someone to be proud of me for something. I don't want to be the failure that gave up my child because I couldnt handle it alone. I don't want to be a disappointment. I want my family to want to talk to me. I dont even know the last time I heard my mother's voice. She has a terminal illness and still chooses not to talk to me. So that's a statement right there. Okay rant over thanks"
2098,Just need to tell myself I told someone.,"For the respect of anyone who doesn't wish to see this, I will be making this nsfw, and covering it in case someone clicks accidentally. If you're here for help, please move on, I don't want to impede your progress.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!This isn't a need for help, but just letting someone who hopefully isn't judgemental know that I've made up my mind. Nothing has any more feeling. I come to reddit because it's one of the last social media platforms where people seem like they have a soul but I lack connection and help, and I've been lacking it for a while. It's not something I wish to continue to pursue. !&lt;

&gt;!I've spent the whole morning wondering how I got to this point. And instead of waiting for the anser, I actively searched for all the possible reasons:!&lt;

&gt;!I'm trans. There's so much controversy around that in it's own right, even the idea of ""41%"" comments that bigots use when telling me to kill mysle.f 41% is the number that attempt suicide when not given access to tearment. Other than that, we still have to endure violence. I truly just want to be myself, and this is something that I'm sure that I am. I don't want to be this way. I wish I was comfortable with my assigned gender at birth. I wish I didn't like womens clothing, ways of speaking, not having their anatomy, feelings, etc. I wish I had none of it. I only speak for myself with this. I love the LGBTQ and I always will be an ally without question. But my own personal experiences have been that of still not fitting in after coming out. It seems most trans people are hard to come by irl, and many to most on social media already have their cliques and such. So I'm still a ""lone wolf"". No one to protect or defend me when I get hate messages on here or twitter or instagram in response to topics irrelevant of my gender or any talk of gender or sex being initiated by me. I just wanted to live, so this is a strike on that.!&lt;

&gt;!The next is my family life. My family never really understood me. My biological dad was abusive. He would literally push me around, yell at me and beat me for messing up in video games. He would get upset when I cried at being unsure if he was gonna hurt me. I wanted to be Sailor Moon for halloween one year, and he said no that's for sissies. Then I asked about Princess Leia because it was less colorful, and was called a faggot. I settled with Darth Vader. I like him too but I wore him around as a result of something negative so it wasn't as fun. Sometimes we would laugh together over cartoons and rarely in video games, but that's when he wasn't drinking, or at random times. I cant remember much. I'm just putting together what I can remember. I don't remember much before when I turned 8, other than a few bad beatings and let downs. Eventually he stopped letting me come over, being how most bio dads are. Last picture of him wasn't memorable as it was. My step dad was probably the best thing to happen to me for most of my childhood growing up. He was always laid back, never had to yell at me, only beat me once and that's because I stole something from a store but I was also too really young. Maybe 8 or 9. I never got caught, I only got caught because I told my mom out of guilt and wanted to return it, and she told him. But my step dad is pleasant. He's what I think every dad should be. He's a reason I didn't mind being in a boy's body for a good while. As for my mom, she did what she could, but we never saw eye to eye. A lot of her reminded me of my bio dad. So I avoided her a lot. I was always told to watch my tone or follow orders, ultimately suppressing my emotions and true feelings into being quiet unless spoken to. People praising me one minute for being so quiet and smart, but also wondering why I don't talk or seem like I care. When I expressed where I wanted to go to college, my mom hated every choice. So I stayed in the city. Forced me to open a loan. I didnt want dorm life, and she forced me. More money out of my pocket.  I hated it. Ended up leaving after my first year, empty handed. Horrible experiences, abusive relationship with my girlfriend. All of this fueled me to play video games more than I normally would. Contributes to excessive escapism.!&lt;

&gt;!I hopped from a community college, to the stupid art institute in the span of 2 1/2 years, trying to find my place. I wanted to to graphic design. My mom told me I would never be good at it, and to go for something practical. This hurt because I used to go to a performing arts school and played recitals and a fewconcerts with our cities symphony orchestra. And I initially went to school for film, though not at a college of my choice. So I didnt understand why she was being hurtful. Looking back, this triggered a lot of my childhood memories and distanced me further.!&lt;

&gt;!Fast forward to 2014 and working odd jobs and an on and off relationship with a friend I met around my high school time in between, and I'm out of town. I let my guard down while having a hotel room to myself, and fell asleep watching Drag Race. I had a vivid dream of becoming a woman. And was scared that my past was coming back to haunt me. Reached out to my (off at the time) gf interest as shes one of the only people I feel I can trust. I start exploring makeup and femininity, and this brings us closer together, to the point of dating again. Out of fear of who or what I am, I distance myself. She threatens to leave me if I dont open up more. So I open up. !&lt;

&gt;!Fast forward, and feeling motivated to find myself, and Im back in school, and a lot further in life than I was. But I've finally evolved from Drag to Crossdresser, to realizing I'm trans. This temporarily tears a rift between us, because despite me not wanting surgeries, only hormones, and her saying she's always thought of herself as pansexual, she doesn't think she can be with a trans woman. So I go back to distancing myself. Now, she states she wants to be with me, but her presence is lacking. I try to connect with her. she's so passive unless I threaten to break up with her, and she doesnt see the irony all these years later.!&lt;

&gt;!My mom constantly tells me ""no matter how many pills you take, you'll never be a real woman, or know what real women go through and you'll always be my son"". Even explaining calmly why this hurts my feelings, she states that I dont take her or anyone elses feelings into account. She cries like she always does when I show individual thought in my life, and says that it's selfish that I want to be a woman now, and that if I ever killed myself, no one would forgive me because I'm so selfish.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!The things I do for everyone. I drive people places, and never ask for gas. I pay my own bills short of rent, and help out where I can. I'm never without a job. I'm in school, the school that I've wanted to be in all those years ago, and now she parades me around like Im a trophy for her social media. !&lt;

&gt;!My girlfriend can barely do anything herself, and I even go to help her mom out because her own children dont help her. And shes such a sweet woman. She's a second mom in a way. My girlfriend uses people and hasnt changed since I met her in the worst ways. She lives to hold up a fake image on social media and it makes me respect her less with every post.!&lt;

&gt;!My father and sister I feel are the only people who truly love me and want me to be happy. They're at least honest if they cant help, but they always listened.!&lt;

&gt;!I'm sorry for the life story. I just needed to tell someone. I'm tired, I have no fight in me, I am done. I want to congratulate the world, because it truly has drained every ounce of my energy, care, and spirit.!&lt;

&gt;!I intend to go out quietly,, as to not worry about anyone finding a gross body.!&lt;

&gt;!If you have methods fom least to moderately painful but I above all, need something effective. I'll find it regardless. !&lt;"
2099,I shouldn’t be here anymore.,
2100,A little bit of poetry / which sums up my misery / which trapped me inside my dark doom / and led me here unto my doom.,"All of us are cursed from birth to die,
But many a human has asked why,
Some die happy, others in pain,
Ill in either body or brain,
The unfairness makes me cry.

Some are born lucky, some are not,
Some are denied what others got,
Some are born on third base,
Others in a far worse place,
The ones that the world forgot.

I am racked by anxiety,
Depression with hampers my liberty,
A bladder disease that is chronic,
That cannot be healed by any tonic,
And a nasty dose of OCD.

I tried to fight, I tried to live,
I gave my all that I could give,
For a while I worked for the state,
But I can never escape my fate,
I hope my parents can forgive.

Even now, in my final days,
I am still looking for ways,
To try and make everything right,
But all my hopes are out of sight,
There is only death in my gaze.

I do not believe in any lord on high,
No big daddy in the sky,
There is no scientific proof,
Religion is nothing but a ruse,
To scare people before they die.

But if god exists, then he is evil,
Far worse to us than the devil,
Why would he create so much pain,
Make humans suffer again and again,
Its a mindset that is medieval.

No, I just want to be a peace,
Let me put aside my worries, please,
To end this misery called life,
Using gun, or rope, or pills or knife
So that I may at last be at ease."
2101,I’ve had a cocktail of chemical and pills ready for months and I think it’s time to down it.,I’ve been depressed and suicidal for as long as I can remember I just turned 18 and I honestly didn’t think I’d make it this far  but I’m ready to go. Everything sucks and I’m tired.
2102,I have lost faith in god,
2103,"graduated. have a job. I guess that's enough proof that I ""Made It"" Suicide is still the thing I want the most.","I sit here in the office, just staring blankly at my screen.  I haven't done any work in days.  I finished school sometime last week.  Outside of my raise for a degree... it all just feels like a waste.  I never wanted to live.  I never wanted to succeed.  Yet, here I am.  A comfortable, empty life.   Empty.   I'm not sure if I have ever cared about anything beyond the moment."
2104,I think I might kms,"I've already talked to a counselor, I'm in fostercare right now and everything is good but I want to selfharm more, I want to commit suicide. Idk how to stop this thoughts and I'm only 12 so I should be able to have a normal childhood, I don't want my life to be like this but I'm too young. I haven't lived life to the fullest. Well. I think the only think that's stopping me from doing it are my friends. They know I cut but they don't know I am suicidal. I will miss them. I will miss everyone around me except my parents. I will miss being able to live, just the smallest things like smelling a flower or smiling to a toddler even taking the bus with some friends for a short ride. I guess it's the simple think called ego ""I don't want to miss them""."
2105,I feel like a burden to my boyfriend and his family,"4 months ago I  moved out of my parents house because I wasn’t happy with the way they were treating me. I moved in with my boyfriend (at his dad’s house). Everything was fine at first. Then we started having some money issues and job issues and now we’re barely making ends meet and he’s so stressed out and I just feel like I caused all this and I just feel like a burden to him. If I express this to him, he’ll obviously deny it. I’ve picked up an extra job to help with money (even thinking about getting a 3rd) but I feel like it won’t make a difference and I don’t know how to fix it. I can’t move out I don’t have the money rn. I just feel like I should just die and it would make it a lot easier for everyone."
2106,I'm getting a therapist,"So I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now, I even cut. I was planning on killing myself this Tuesday but my dad told me that I'm gonna talk to a therapist next Friday. I'm actually so happy right now"
2107,I feel like I'm falling back into my depression.,"Some background first.

I've been with this girl for almost three years now and everything has been perfect since we first got together. I was even planning on proposing when she finishes college but lately she feels really distant
distant and I noticed she's changed. Its like she doesn't care for me anymore. Whenever I call her its like im bothering her and she wants to hang up as soon as possible and whe she comes over to hang out whe basically ignores me, if I don't try to cuddle she'll ignore me and just sleep. Ive tried so hard to re-ignite the spark between us but its like she doesn't even notice me. I feel like she found someone else because she lied to me about going back home after a night out with friends but I know for a fact she stayed somewhere else &amp; when we talked over the phone she was almost whispering and it felt like she wanted to hurry up. Im scared im just not enough for her anymore. 


Im scared my depression will come back because she is the whole reason I got better in the first place. I was in a very very bad place a few years back. I got into drugs, I tried to kill myself a couple of times and would cut myself everyday because I was so numb to the pain. It was so bad that I carried a razor blade with me everywhere. I don't want to be in that dark place ever again because I know I wouldn't be able to handle it this time around. I don't want to kill myself because it would break my mom's and my best friend's heart but I can say for sure im strong enough. I can feel this feeling of powerlessness taking over me once again and I'm scared this time my depression will win.

Thats all I had to say. Im not looking for advice.
I just needed to say what was on my heart because at this point Ive already lost all hope. 

Thanks for listening"
2108,Does Xanax make it easier?,"For exsanguination, that is. I've terrible anxiety, and a particular obsession with cardiac function. It doesn't help that a cardiologist told me yesterday that I may have a weakened heart after performing an echocardiogram. I'm now on a heart monitor with further testing lined up after Christmas. Reading further into the stages of blood loss, it seems I can expect my heart and anxiety to really give me trouble as I approach death. I don't want to stop the act because of my nervousness. Would Xanax be an effective tool to manage my unrest so that I can follow through with my intentions?"
2109,i cant stop thinking about my ex friends reactions when i finally fucking do it and everything they though about me was wrong,  All the asshole people in this world ive gotten acquainted with have NO idea what i go through and just think i can get over it by changing my mindset. Ill change when im fucking dead.
2110,Feeling numb af,I feel like I'm dreaming. It feels like I'm not here. Even if I'm doing something I feel like I'm not actually doing it. I've got a terrible headache so I know I'm not dreaming or anything.
2111,I lost my virginity to a luxury escort,I lost my virginity to a luxury escort and I feel guilty. I feel like I took advantage of her; I couldn't even get much pleasure because of the guilt. I wanted to have sex before killing myself. Now I am finally going to do it.
2112,i want to die but i know i wont do anything..,"Like many of the other posts here I've been contemplating suicide. And I've felt this way for a long time. Sometimes I have my ups. Sometimes I have my downs. This year has been especially down. I lost my mom, my partner recently broke up with me and i'm glad to be graduating soon but i never wanted to go to college. But staying home wouldve been hell too.  My family has been awful since her passing and I honestly would rather sleep outside than go home. I dont like either side of my family right now. My moms half is just toxic and talks about each other. 

And i have never really been fond of my dad's half of the family. I hadnt felt excited about graduating in a few days cause i actually liked college. it was a hell of a lot better than high school where no one really liked me and I didnt have friends. i actually have friends now.. college gave me a place to stay but also put me i to years of debt. i never wanted to go though. i dont even know what i want to do. been here for this fucking long and i"
2113,I'm going to be 33 next year. Is there still hope to restart my life again?,"I remember when I started working about 7 years ago. I was full of energy and excited about life, excited to meet new people. Fast forward 7 years later, I'm still single, never had a girlfriend, I'm broke, I'm unemployed, during the worse phases of my depression I would punch my head so hard just to stop all the negative thoughts in my head. Everyone I know are married and have their own houses, their own cars. I still live with my parents. I just don't feel alive anymore. Not interested in life anymore. Tell me there's more life has to offer."
2114,Anybody to talk to?,"I've never felt this miserable before, I don't know what to do. Please."
2115,"I keep contemplating to kill myself or not, I don’t have any reason to stay it’s always just “what if things get better?”","I know things won’t get better, I know this is just how life is and I’m too weak to handle it, I’m not a fighter I just run away from everything wrong in my life. It’s not long before I can’t run anymore and I just collapse, I’ll fall and end it. I can’t stand feeling like this anymore, but I have an annoying feeling that what if my life changes? What if it gets better? What if a stranger comes and actually cares about me? I cling to that feeling and each time I forget about it my feelings get worse, I feel l Ike shit, I want to die, I want to stop thinking that things will change."
2116,My anxiety is horrible today,"I am contemplating leaving work to end my life. I was asked a question by my Manager and I didn't process what he said. I blanked out, and didn't clarify what he meant by his question. I cannot go on anymore. I am leaving work to end things,"
2117,I'm afraid of 2020,"i've always been terrified about the future, i don't want to be just another maggot who works all day with a boss yelling at your face, no i don't want this life, fuck school, fuck work, i'm fucking done."
2118,“Death is permanent you can’t come back”,"It’s amazing to me how many people say this sort of thing to stop someone from wanting to kill themself. 

Don’t you get it? That’s the point. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to change my mind. Do you really think I’m so delusional that I believe I’ll die then decide I could have lived longer and come back? Are you really so delusional you don’t see I want to die /i because/i it means I won’t be coming back?"
2120,Just a failure who's getting nowhere.,"I've fail at everything..
I've failed at not ruining my relationship with the one person who I've ever loved. 
I'm currently failing highschool. 
I've failed at being healthy and fit. 
I've failed at getting a job. 
I've failed at having friends. 
I've failed to the point where I'm going to be kicked out of my parents house. 
Maybe the one thing I won't fail at will be ending my life."
2121,Wasted Time and Future Fright,"My anxiety has flared up once again and is pushing me to the side of hopelessness. Everytime I think about going back to college to make a career for myself I get paralyzed and suicidal thinking about how long it will take and how old I will be once I get out. 

A bit of background, I'm 23 years old with a Bachelor's in Science, major in Geology. I went into the field because I enjoyed crystals and minerals, only to learn upon graduation that my location for jobs is horrible and most jobs are well-logging or underground mining operations. I figured I would putt around for a year living with my parents until I decided. I decided that I hate geology, regret wasting those years foolishly chasing a degree, and may waste more years chasing another major for similar results. I thought about going further into a geophysics master's or go into a computer science, but I reach the daunting conclusion above, time. 23 years old without a stable career, living with my parents (who will kick me out soon), student loans, unable to enlist in the military, and an overwhelming anxiety to move forward. I don't know what else to add to this other than that I am severely sleep deprived at the moment due the anxiety and urge to die. Taking medication right now, but I doubt it's the right dosage or complete fix. How does a ball of anxiety living in the middle of bumfuck nowhere find a dream job? I've pointed a gun to my head once, maybe this time I should pull the trigger."
2122,"i have no future, i have been skating along on a thread for years and will be chewed up and spit out by society","i am useless. i serve no purpose but to cost my mother money. i failed school because i have no motivation to do anything for myself. i do online school which i barely pass. i only have 3 friends, which i wouldnt call more then homies because of the nature of male friendships. i join discord servers but can never form relationships because of how boring i am. im not adventurous and am afraid of everything. im wasting my teenage years away on the computer doing nothing because im either too bad at it or too afraid. i had a job doing dishes which i was fired for. im too incompetent to even do the dishes. i can barely focus on anything because my attention span is shot due to years of phone use, anime, and video games. i like to think im mature for my age but everyone just thinks im either creepy or a general 'chill' and dont think i am worthy of a second thought most of the time. im just wasting away my teenage years enjoying the ability to coast off my moms money until im old enough to purchase a gun for myself a do everyone a favor. i know my momloves me and i am her only child, and i do love her very much, but she demeans me every chance she can get in front of her friends because shes so embarassed of me and is more prone to laugh at me when i tell her my problems rather then be concerned, so i see no reason to curse her to decades of shame. my father is the same."
2124,"I have an honest question that nobody has any answer to: what the fuck do you do besides suicide when ""help"" doesn't help?","Been trying therapy and meds for about 5 years. I'm starting today med #11. I've seen 7 therapists and 4 psychiatrists. None of it has done a thing. Whatever you're about to suggest I've probably tried unless it's ketamine or ECT because my insurance wouldn't cover them.




So what the fuck do you do? I'm SO so close to ending it."
2125,Doing it,"My wife left me and I play to much fortnie. No thing to live for. RIP me.

Taken 8 pills"
2126,Take me away,"It's been 6 years, or at least 6 that I remember, I only learned about this kind of stuff in middle school. All I know is that I feel so fucking empty. I'm 19 now. I stay in my room all day, playing the same game, Forza, the only place where I feel a little better. I'm in a household where I can't be myself and be accepted. I've lost all my friends because I either fucked up all my relationships or I pushed them away. I'm so lonely, the only one I had was my girlfriend but she's moved on. It's to the point now where I don't wanna get better. No matter how hard I try, it only gets worse. I know I'm gonna end up alone. No one wants a guy like me, I'm worthless. Everyone had such high expectations of me, and I couldn't fulfill them. I faded away, away from anyone who could see me and now I'm here. I'm drinking, I'm depressed, and I don't wanna live anymore."
2127,i'm afraid of 2020,"This will be the year that i've always feared the most, idk, being an adult, i think like a teenager and for some reason i think i may kill myself between 2020 or 2025"
2128,"Severe OCD, Severe anxiety, severe paranoia. Killing myself.",
2129,Goodbye guys,I have decided to kill myself bye
2130,I might end it,"I was told that nothing I ever do has any meaning or must not be true because my dad doesn't see it.

Everyday I try so hard to better myself, I was bullied out of school and had a learning disability. I did get my GED though.

I tried finding work, but none of them worked out or nobody would hire me. I have sciatica so it's difficult.

I want to learn to drive, but neither of my parents will teach me. They put in no effort to help me and then say they do everything, yet can't.

He told me I had no one in this world besides them. He's probably right. My few friends are sort of long distance.

He told me I'm not doing anything useful or helpful.

I've been trying for the longest time to start up my art career. I've also been wanting stream and maybe do youtube.

For the past few days, I think I've been doing okay with my art. I'm trying to get into a work flow though. I tried making a Fiverr job post, but nobody's been wanting my art. I do post on social media, trying to get a bit of attention, but I don't.

So despite how hard I try, it apparently doesn't exist because I'm not making instant bank to take care of my parents.

I don't want to, mind you.

I told myself as soon as I get to be somewhat financially stable, I'm getting out ASAP.

I finally started to be able to take care of myself health wise because of my mother's insurance.

I really need a psychiatrist, and I did have a doctor's referral, it's just taking a very long time.

Death terrifies me and the guilt of leaving my few friends behind is the only thing that has really stopped me.

When I was being yelled at earlier, I was told to not cry and suck it up. I wish I didn't have to feel things so strongly.

It's just really shitty to always be told by your father that you'll never amount to anything while your mother just stands there silently agreeing with them. The one person in this stupid world that's supposed to always have your back, never does.

I'm sorry I wasn't the big brain millionaire millennial you wanted me to be so I could take care of you, dad.

I'm sorry I wasn't born a boy, mom.

I'm sorry I was bullied out of school.

I'm sorry I cry over everything.

I'm sorry I'm depressed.

I'm sorry that I'm fat and have an ED.

I'm sorry that I'm autistic.

I'm sorry that I exist."
2131,I’m just so tired,I just want everything to stop. Stop feeling so heavy. Stop feeling like everything’s my fault or every move I make or thing I say is wrong. Stop feeling like such a waste of space who will never do anything but fail at life. Just stop. I want my family to understand and not thinking I’m faking it and making shit up 24/7. To stop accusing me for being on drugs when I oversleep or when I want to do nothing stay in bed all day. Stop feeling like everything I do or say or feel is wrong. I just want to stop so fucking badly it genuinely hurts to keep going. I’m tired of feeling like a burden or a mistake. I try and try and fucking try to explain what I’m feeling or doing and they just won’t see or hear it. I feel like I’m stuck in a glass box screaming at everyone from the inside but the glass is too thick and they don’t want to hear it. I’m just done. I want everything to stop.
2132,I don't feel right. I'm sorry for being alive.,"I have no one to vent to, so I'm just going to vent here in short bursts. Sorry.

-I've never had a best friend, I feel so lonely and embarrassed that I don't hang out with anyone.
-I hate the way I look
-I can't stand my brother and I can't believe my mother always defends him and what he does,
- I miss my sister, I wish we had a relationship, but instead she's been kicked out and she's now a drug addict. She doesn't want to talk to me anymore.
-I feel sorry for my cat and my dog.
-I'm a shit friend, I can't even be bothered to message people, I'm just wasting their time.
-I have no future, I'm failing all of my classes.
-why does this girl in my class have to be so mean and rude, why can't she just keep her own opinion to herself?
- I don't think I'm a lovable person, I'm incapable of opening up to people and I'm not exactly fun or attractive.
-why can't I just kill myself already?
-why did I ever think that things would get better?
- I don't want Christmas to come.
-I don't want to do tomorrow.
-I hate my brother so much."
2133,Hello kind internet strangers,I am gona be honest with you guys. Is it bad that everyday I get up I think of death? Like I don't even think about doing dangerous things that can kill me. I have one month of my holiday left before I go back to school and I don't think I am gona make it. I don't want to make it. I just want to close my eyes forever
2134,Have you ever thought about who you’d like to find you when you’re successful?,"I’ve been trying to determine who I could find me once I’ve been successful. My method would be from hanging so I’d rather not be in that position too long. I’d also like to eliminate the possibility of a family member finding me also. 
So it basically comes down to timing and someone who can accept a situation easier than what a family member can."
2135,Never attempt suicide with painkillers like ibuprofen.,"I tried to kill myself with paracetamol and it really really really fucking hurts your liver and doesn’t work very well. 

Don’t kill yourself in general but really don’t try to with stuff like that."
2136,I feel like I’m going to throw up,"The anxiety.. the depression.. the loneliness

Had an extremely nasty breakup with my girlfriend of 8 months

I have to go into work with her. Don’t shit where you eat, I know, but it’s too late.

She hates me now, I’ve hated her for a while but somehow loved her with all my heart. It’s funny how that works. She’s fucked me over time and time again but she’s all I want right now.

I don’t know what to do. I feel like some pills and this gun would solve all my issues right now though.

I wish I had a time machine. I wish I could’ve prevented what happened. I wish I could be laying with her watching Netflix right now.

I don’t want to be alive. I hate this cold, dark room. Especially all alone."
2137,I don't see myself lasting for more than a month at this point,I've planned it out. carbon monoxide poisoning. just waiting for the day where I'm not coward enough to go though with it
2138,I actually can’t be bothered,I don’t even feel sad anymore I just feel nothing.
2139,It’s always this fucking place,"I’m either in math or physics and that’s where I want to jump out the window the most. Fucking why. Tonight might actually be the night boys, I’ve been a huge pussy about it every other time. Give me some luck dudes. Posting on here as frequently as I do really makes me feel like I should get on with it already."
2140,For the sake of others and myself I am going to kill myself it's the only way I can guarantee that the people I love are going to be safe,
2141,I can't do this anymore,"I want to die. So badly right now. I feel like I'm snapping at everyone and destroying all of my personal relationships. I'm always in pain, constantly. I never feel healthy, I never feel awake, and I don't think it's ever going to get better. I constantly feel like lead. All throughout my life, I've only wanted to help others and see the world get better, but no matter what I do or how much work I put in, I feel like it's worthless and I feel like nothing I want to do will ever come to fruition. I don't want to say this to anyone I know personally because some of them are mad at me and I don't want to worry them, nor do I want it to seem like I'm lying to make them talk to me. I just want it all to end. I'm afraid of being sent to a mental hospital...I'm already getting help but I can't tell anyone this because I'm afraid of what will happen. Yet...I can't do this anymore...I've felt like this a lot before and I'm sure people are tired of it....."
2142,Why do so many people get to die by accident and for me to die I have to kill myself.,Fuck
2143,Seems odd,I struggle with being around people my age. I’m almost 16 and unless it’s me talking to one person I can’t talk. Sometimes it’s not even anxiety. It’s like something takes over my head and for the life of me I can’t get over it. It’s like U don’t want to be around anyone or even speak. I was bullied for a long time so I feel like shit. I have a lot of self hate that isn’t gonna leave any time soon. I have trust issues but damn I don’t understand why I’m like this. It’s like my emotions control me. Anyone dealing with anything similar?
2144,everything hurts and i'm so tired,i'll be okay. but i just want it to stop.
2145,Should I go to the hospital again?,I literally want to jump out a window. I've been two previous times but it was stupid. Thoughts?
2146,Today is my last day. Im just posting here so there is evidence i did it because i hate myself not for anything or anyone else.,Im going to the highway today and when i reach over 120mph crashing to a concrete wall or a fall and without seatbelt and with a knife stubbed in my stomach to make sure i die
2147,Thinking about ending it all again.,"I'm a 21 year old struggling with my meds right now due to mood swings, bipolar and adhd , loneliness...I'm still a virgin at almost 22 yeah...but seriously I got no friends either...So I think to end it all, it would be better without me. I wrote a longer post 20 hours prior to this but no one gave a damn...sign that I'm disposable."
2148,If I don't end up in foster care I'm gonna kill myself,"My mother forced me and my brother to move to Finland from Norway half a year ago, and it's been absolutely he'll.  I hate it here and I've told her so many times that I wanna leave, and she just replies with ""go move to your father then"". Issue is I hate my father. He wasn't there for my early childhood and honestly he's a selfish prick. My mother decided for us to travel to Norway for christmas specifically the 20th and the return date is 4th of January. My friend told me before we moved that I should go into foster care and that his family will happily foster me, but I didn't listen. I'm now going to attempt to get into foster care in 2 weeks and if I don't manage for some reason I will kill myself. Probably some sort of OD. 
I won't set another step in finland with my mother, I hate it and I hate her, but most of all I hate myself."
2149,"I’m stuck, please help","Honestly im not here because im suicidal (I mean I’m extremely suicidal) but im here because im tired and I just don't know what else to do. I feel exhausted all the time and I feel like life isn't worth living anymore, I mean don't get me wrong life is great but that motivation to live is just gone. Like I have so many good people in my life I don't want to lose them and I don't want them to hurt while missing me but at the same time I have the mental image of them being happy when im gone. I feel so out of touch with myself it's like what do I do? 

I don't know what to do anymore to be happy I am always stressed out over the little things and I mean im so stressed out to the point im losing a shit ton of hair because of it I mean my hair is falling out daily and it's really fucking alarming. I am worried about my own mental health even though I fucking hate myself at times I do care for myself because I mean I don't want to end up the same way I was when I was 13, I was cutting myself and attempting to committing suicide. I’ve already started self harming again after a 5 year streak of being clean, I was unbelievably disappointed when I cut myself for the first time in 5 years I felt fucking disgusting and lower than dirt and that filled my hate against myself heart and it made me do it over and over again. 

It felt good yet wrong at the same time but it was the only thing I could of done especially at the time because I felt like I had no one I felt like I had no one to turn to I felt like the whole world had its back turned against me. I felt not good enough for anyone or anything and I still feel that way and it hurts me every single day every moment of my life, I always ask myself what the fuck is wrong with me? Why can’t I be happy for once what happened to my happiness and my creativity it all went down the fucking drain, now I can barely sleep, eat, talk, or think without feeling like total shit. I contemplate suicide and cutting myself every few days but I never take action because I’m being monitored everyday always being asked to show my skin every few days as well making me feel exposed and low. 

I know they’re only doing this to make sure I stay safe and healthy but I feel like if I cut myself again it’ll make me feel so much better to let the anger I feel towards myself out on my skin watching myself suffer from the feeling of guilt and pain. To make myself feel lower than dirt so it’ll be easier to numb myself so I can commit suicide without hesitation, but first I’d need to push everyone I love and care about away so they wouldn’t be hurt from my actions. I’m tired of hurting people on a daily basis and knowing that me dying will be the last thing that hurts them makes me want to push them away faster. 

Yet, I know I’m only 17 and I have a long life to live but I feel like I have no purpose or like that I have no future when I try to imagine the future now it’s blurry it’s extremely blurry because now I don’t know which path to go, I used to know what path to go down,  I wanted to go to community college then  I wanted to become an animator or a storyboard artist and have a studio apartment to live with my boyfriend for the rest of my life but now I’m losing sight of that because I know I’ll never achieve it. I’m a lost cause I shouldn’t exist I’ve been taking pills half of my life and knowing I’m going to have to take them for the rest of my life makes me feel fucking crazy as if I’m a lunatic, I’m just a fucking disappointment."
2151,I will be fine if i will not wake up tomorrow,Share your stories
2152,i don’t know who to talk to,i don’t want to be here anymore
2153,i really want to do it,"I know there are tons out there and I won't be remembered or this won't be seen but I need the smallest bit of attention like the disgusting vile excuse I am so! I don't mean to be edgy or annoying, I truly don't. 
 
After years of physical abuse ranging to being beat bloody till unconscious by my parents, sexual abuse, tons of homophobia, failing,  taxing emotional abuse and this constant pain, I don't see a way to do it. nothing matters. I'm 16 and can't even take the smallest saying without crying and throwing up in self-disgust. there's no suicide hotline or anything. no support for the LGBT in a Muslim country with the death penalty for the LGBT. I haven't met someone disgusting like me. all I ever wanted was parents that loved me as much as I loved them. I wanted happiness and a shred of love but all I got was this. hell isn't a place, its whatever is in my chest because it doesn't feel alive and I want it to stop.  
I genuinely wish I was dead. not because my coping mechanisms outweigh the pain but because after all previous attempts, I have finally gained the courage to do it and not hold back.  
I just wish it was over and I'm going to do it tomorrow, that's all.  
I hope you all find the happiness and love you give others so selflessly because you all deserve it."
2154,She packed her stuff and shes gone soon,"I think this is the final step for me to go, she is gone.
She wants to go, she probably wants to break up, but cant...
Im gona do it in couple hours, just waiting for my fam to sleep and im gona drink something, pop some sleeping pills and ill try to hang myself.
It was nice while it lastet 

I love this girl a lot and she means everything to me, but i am not good for her...
I tried my best to get her into a positive mindset, but the only thing im doing is hurting her..."
2155,I want to kill myself,"I thinking every day about killing myself. I’m super dizzy and in pain every single day, no matter what I do. I went to several doctors. They can’t tell me what’s wrong. 
I can’t live my life like that. I wake up every morning, cry all day until I can go back to sleep. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no hope."
2156,I keep falling and don't know how to get out,"
I graduated college 5 years ago today and turn 28 next month. The last years have been this perpetual hole where I keep thinking ""This is it, this is rock bottom"" only to find out it gets deeper.  

I'm a teacher who has dealt with perpetual underemployment becayse I picked the wrong certification. I've barely scraped by paycheck-to-paycheck for five years not and I can't do it anymore. Yesterday I heard back from interview #23, and once again it was another no. Once again I'm a ""strong candidate but not who they're looking for at this time. I'd go back to grad school, but can't afford to apply or take the GRE. I've applied to dozens, if not hundreds of jobs outside if education and only gotten 1 interview. People, even professionals have coached me, looked over my resume, etc. but it's bore no fruit. 

I look at homeless or other destitute people or think about the family friend who tried his best and simply never made it anywhere in life so he's 50 and lives with his parents, and it feels like I'm peering into the future that God, the Universe, or whatever has planned for me. If that's the case, I'd rather die. 

Furthermore, while I have plenty of great friends, I've always struggled with loneliness and longing for intimate companionship. I was single until I was 26, and recently my GF of 10 months and I broke up. Once again, dating apps, bars, etc have gotten me nowhere. I'm so fucking touch starved. 

I don't know what to do at this point; it feels like I'll never accomplish my dreams. I've looked into becoming a digital nomad but it sounds so lonely, I've looked into joining a commune but I'd never get to travel and experience the world. Death seems like a viable option because I don't want to live if this is going to be my life, I don't want to live a life were I never marry or travel the world."
2157,I really hate my brother.,"I have no talk to. I hate my life so much. I wish I wasn't born. I wish I never knew my brother, he is so nasty. I really wanna die, I'm just failing at everything."
2158,Can someone talk to me?,I feel alone. Anyone would mean so much.
2159,helpless,"i just hate everything. i hate myself, i hate my life and i hate everything revolving around it. i’m 15 and i’ve spoken to my mom about my feelings. she started to say that i was privileged and that i wasn’t allowed to be depressed or suicidal. she also said that ‘real’ depressed people don’t say they need help. WELL IM SORRY FOR TRYING TO GET HELP. i’m very aware that i’m really privileged but i feel so suicidal and i’m ALWAYS sad. then she started to insult me and making fun of me. so my chance of getting help is now gone. and i know that if i don’t get help then i will probably end up dead. oh well. at this point i’m just done. i don’t know how i will do it or when. also i’ve given everyone around me enough signs and they just insulted me instead of trying to understand. i don’t even feel guilty anymore because they don’t care. no one does. i know that i need help but i won’t get it, so why am i still here? i’ve been feeling suicidal since i was around 9, i’m just messed up and i feel like the only way to prove to my mom that i’m suffering is to end my life."
2160,I’m losing all hope,Haven’t found a job. Getting behind. All alone. I’m a loser and want death.
2161,Getting closer.,"Life isn't easy at the moment. Nobody likes me, I'm stuck in a situation I can't get out of, and I'm getting closer to just fucking giving up. I always hear 'it'll get better' which is correct but then it just happens again. An endless cycle that I am stuck in."
2164,Here to discuss whether there is a link between suicide and being shadowbanned.,
2165,Everyone only thinks about themselves,"Everyone only thinks of themselves I have run out of options. Now it’s time for me to think about myself and what’s best for me, and I believe that’s to end my life. 

I have reached out time and time again and I have been made to feel awful each time I do that I shouldn’t bare that burden on anyone else. Last night I needed help I needed support and I was left alone stranded with no help, people just left me when I needed them most and made things worst. I know me being like this helps no one but they don’t understand how hard it is, I know it makes people sad but I’m reaching out a bit of sadness is a small price to pay to help someone’s life. 

But it’s doesn’t matter anymore last night was the last straw as things are getting worst for me. Goodbye everyone I’m sorry for being selfish."
2166,"I'm teetering on the edge of offing myself, or leaving everything behind and starting a new life.","I truly can't deal with this anymore. Being alive is a constant nightmare, and therapy no longer helps. I don't want to go on anymore, and I'm so tired of waking up. I wish I could just sleep for the rest of my days."
2167,He doesn't love me,"He doesn't love me. I don't think he has for a while. Today confirmed he doesn't love me. He flipped out at me in front of friends because he forgot something for a game night.
I was crying in the kitchen of my friends house. They said that it doesn't look like he loves me.
He doesn't say I love you anymore. Only replies sometimes when I say it.

This isn't a schoolgirl crush. This is my fiancé of seven months. And he doesn't love me.

My heart is so heavy. I feel like my bones are made of lead. I don't think I can go on. I don't want to carry on."
2168,Is it worth it?,I'm so tired of fighting. I'm constantly in an existential crisis. I don't know what's real anymore. I feel like everything is fake or that it's all a simulation. I'm afraid of speaking anymore. I seem to get offended by anything. My emotions are so...bipolar. I can go from completely happy to arguing fake arguments and crying and being angry in a heartbeat. It seems my therapist doesn't know what to do. My last one didn't either. It seems like the world is going down in flames. It'll probably become inhabital in in 20 years or so. That means my dreams of getting married? Not worth it. My dreams of graduating with a degree? Not worth it. Having kids? That would be cruel considering the conditions. I'm surrounded by politics where everyone is fighting and it seems women's rights are being thrown to the side. I probably won't have any rights in the next five years. It's all going downhill. Is it actually worth it? Has it all been a lie? Can someone tell me it's not what I think it is? Or is this really it?
2169,Spiralling.,Thinking of jumping off a building right now.
2170,"I wanted to kill myself, but diarrhea stopped me.","True story bro/sis. Tomorrow is my 32nd birthday, and... it was not worth going on for all those years, because I got nowhere, achieved nothing. I'm exactly where I was 32 years ago. There is only one thing that I regreat, and that is not doing it earlier, while still being 1X years old, or even younger, like X. 

Postponing is common, but... beside not sleeping well etc. I got such a huge stomach ache + abdominal pain, like never before. 6 times in the bathroom so far, my face is all red and burns, I look kind of pale. I never fell well, but recently much worse, I guess it's because I think of ending it all, and whenever I do, I freak out.

I read many wise things on this Reddit, and definitely ""the more you think of it, the less likely you are to do it"", and ""the more you think of it, the longer it takes to do it"" are very true. So true, I think it's stress.

My final resting place is a long walk from where I live, I can't imagine myself shitting every couple meters on the roadside.  

It's not that early anymore, but who knows, maybe I'll do it as planned. Another day, another opportunity!"
2171,"I will never be able to live independently, I'll always be a burden to the ones I love.",My family kicked me out years ago because I didn't want to conform to their religious practices. I'm autistic. I can work part time but have a cap on how much energy I can give. If it's reached I literally can't see myself going in. I'm living in a friends basement with the promise of moving out and I don't want to live with a stranger. It would cause a lot of anxiety. Am I going to have to live with strangers on a part time job till the day I die? I can't see myself getting into a relationship ever because I just don't have the energy for that. I don't want to live off others kindness forever. I don't want to just take from the people I care about. I want to be able to give. My mind and body have been through so much and I think this is as far as I'm getting. The very bottom line is that I've been dealt a bad hand and just am not enough.
2172,Does anyone know how to commit suicide efficiently?,"So, you've read the title, you know what I want to do. I just want to know how to do it without any chance of failure. I'm not okay, and I just want to make it stop. I know how powerful is internet, so I beg you, just tell me how. I prepare everythings, I'm creating a riddle that is a ""security"". With that, the reason will be only discover by a person who love me, if this person exist.

Anyway, please answer, I hope you could help me.

2173,Might kill myself or get myself in the hospital tomorrow.,"I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and have this aching feeling to kill myself afterwards. I've been inpatient under his watch for 5 months and he sent me home for 2 weeks because I wasn't attending therapy enough, sleeping too much and not finding any connection with other patients. I'm so mad at him I have no words. Am I too depressed to treat? What kind of bullshit is that? I ask for and allow treatment and help and they are denying it from me. What more can I honestly do? I see no other way out."
2174,I'm an alcoholic and miserable,I just want to die. I'm excited for things in life but I can't enjoy a bit of it. If I'm sober I'm riddled with anxiety and depression so I eventually cave and drink to feel better and I do feel better for a bit but then it bites me in the ass and the cycle continues. Do I want to drink no.. but I just want to feel okay. I can't think of anything better than just dying. I'm tired of being miserable.
2175,Just A Rant,"I was fine for a few seconds this morning before I realized which body I am in. Then it started. Not only am I disgusting to look at, but I am worthless too because I can never follow up with what I need to. I have no talent. I have zero marketable skills. I have depression, which saps my work ethic. I have suicidal ideation, which makes me a fucking liability.  My worth is reaching negative. My level of burdening is going to reach sky high levels come Jan. Maybe earlier,as I am about to get fired for being my USUAL absent employee self. There is no amount of explaining I can give that will save my job. For what did I take off? To wallow in self pity like the fucking hog I am. I have zero discipline.  I am disgusting. I ate cookies today because  I aM sAD. 

My existence takes more than it gives, no matter what stage I am in. I just want to die."
2176,Any idea of how to kill myself and make it look like an accident so my family wouldn't suffer as much?,"I'm tired of trying to be happy, even thought i have a great job and great car, lots of good friends. That doesn't make me happy at all. I've tried to get a GF but i already got rejected over 30 times and i dont have the energy to keep trying. I'm getting really behind my job the things that used to take me 5 minutes now it takes me 2 hours. I stopped taking care of myself long time ago. I tried exercise but absolutely made no difference, i tried to kill myself with the tredmill by going 200 heart rate for 40 minutes straight but my fucking heart would not stop. I feel like a failure even thought i dont have any real reason. I already told a friend and when she asked me last week how i was feeling i lied and said i was doing great. I dont have the guts to go to professional help. Every single minute of the day i critize myself and I cant keep going like that. Please someone help!!!!"
2177,I just want to be gone,I have a good life I guess I'm just really tired and fed up. I'm giving my life a year. A year to this day then I will slit my wrists to the veins if it's not better.
2178,Not suicidal but r/selfharm didn't do anything so I thought I'd put this here,"Nothing is stopping me from cutting but my own will, but even that seems to be running out. I've been keeping Wrigley in business with the amount of gum I chew to keep from biting my nails, but the minute I don't have a pack on me I'm biting cuticles into blood. With finals coming up I just don't know how I'm going to handle the stress. I could try telling my girlfriend but I don't want to scare or worry her. I could tell my parents but they will be worried I didn't tell them sooner, and I know a med changes could take weeks. I'm only a month or two clean but since I've been through the system again and gotten all new meds I thought things would get better, but it seems things are just getting worse. This isn't an attention seeking thing, this is a cry for help. What do I do? Is it worth it to relapse"

I am also in a stable relationship with a girl I wouldn't ever wish to leave. But even when everything seems right, I wake up every morning and wish that I hadn't, because I feel separate from everyone, I feel like I don't belong and I hate myself for it.

When you say that to a suicidal person, you just show them that you give zero f*cks about their situation and the misery they are going through. Which doesn't help them at all!!!!!!! (And this is coming from a suicidal person). 
You want me to think about others? Seriously? But where is Myself in all this sh*t? Where is my comfort and my peace of mind? Do you really want me to think about those around me and forget about myself? Do you really want me to keep suffering just to see others smile and laugh?

2194,Friend tried to take is own life and now I feel really overwhelmed and depressed.,"Hello, 1st time posting.

Recently my friend told me that he had a plan to kill himself at a certain date unless his life got sorted out, but he had no plans to sort his life out. This date was pretty far into the future, so I have not really considered it that much. Anyways, one night I get a snap from him on snapchat saying that he is going to walk to the closest train track and lie down until a train runs him over and I genuinely believe that he would have done that had I not intervened.  
My friend lives in an entirely different country than me and we play games together online and talk etc. so I called the cops in my country at about 1AM in the morning and gave them all the information I had about my friend in the other country and at 3AM I got a confirmation that they had picked him up.

After this, he got scheduled for a couple of doctors appointments where he got prescribed anti-depressants which made him feel a bit better for a while, but after a couple of weeks I was in an online call with him and he started chugging down alcohol with me trying my hardest to convince him that it should not be done, but he was too stubborn. About 1AM he goes to the bathroom and I send him a message that I need to go to bed because I have work the next day and he says alright. When I wake up the next morning, I wake up to a snap of him in the hospital in his neighboring city and I am not getting any response from him. This made me worry a lot and has caused me to feel overwhelmed.

5 days later I get a response from him  saying everything is alright and that he has gotten stronger anti-depressants and more scheduled doctor and psychologist appointments and he seemed genuinely happier until I got a snap today where he had started cutting his wrist with a dull knife saying nothing matter anymore and that he probably will stop going to the doctors and psychologists. 

This has made me very overwhelmed and I have developed signs of depression since this has happened and I am not sure who to talk to. I have not shared this with anyone. I have started feeling very burnt out at work and such as well and I think it comes out of worry for my friend and I have no clue who I can talk to. I have never had depression or anything similar before so this feels really heavy for me."
2195,I just want to die right now. I wish I could,
2196,Friend about to commit suicide HELP,"A friend's on the edge of suicide (I hope, they don't answer my messages) what can I do please help me"

I’m so sorry. I really did try."
2200,Spiralling led to the finale,"I’ve got complex PTSD, major depressive disorder and anxiety and it’s been one thing on top of another for months now. I’ve had two hospital stays and in my discharge summary my psychiatrist who I have been seeing has finally had enough of subtly breaking their no self harm policy. In the first stay I went out and got 12 piercings and on the second stay I got 9 tattoos in 10 days.

I came home and things were tense with my husband we almost got divorced. Suicide was ever in my head. Despite this I never let on to my beloved daughter. I started cutting everywhere again, I woke up in tears, I was a waste of space.

5 days ago on impulse I took 3 filled bottles of my tablets and called my daughters father to pick her up then called my sister who called the ambulance. For the next 3 days I have no idea what happened and when I came to i was in the ICU hooked up to a dialysis machine by my neck.

I finally came out of hospital today and while I’ll never be fixed and I’ll always have suicidal ideation I know I will never go down that road again."
2201,I'm sick of trying,I went to a month long treatment just to find life is shit.    My abuser is dating my best friend.   I have no one.   I'm sick of trying.   I'd be better off dead
2202,Tried three times ...kinda,"Took too much of my heart meds to slow my beat down. And have been careless with the needles I need to access my port (I am on daily infusions) 
I am being so cowardly. 
My nurse came in yesterday after I took too many pills and had no clue. 
I have decided I have to go all in with this or shut up about it. I could easily inject my heart with something noxious, but I can’t. 
It seems that I want to go with pills, just drift off and not wake up. 
Got a three months supply of a downer and I don’t know what my doctor is  thinking because these will do it. I almost wonder if she is encouraging me.
Another day dawns.

Im back in a deep dark hole of depression, ive lost everything and everyone. I seriously have nothing to live for at this point. 

Essentially what Im getting at is.. Its so weird knowing when I'm going to die. I've just been counting down the days till im finally able to escape this. But for now Ill keep holding on I guess."

2213,my gf is highly suicidal,"hi everyone,

i was looking for some advice regarding helping my gf with her depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. she's had all of these for a while (3+ years) and has attempted suicide 3 times. we got into a small argument and i'm in a rut right now—she believes that she will not get better and is not willing to get better. it scares me a lot because she told me earlier this week she was willing to try for me but because of our argument she feels like i'm not always going to be there for her. i'm really scared that if we were to break up that she would be gone very soon after. i know being with her is an incentive not to commit suicide and i fully believe that she will get better if we continue to be together. however during depressive episodes and arguments she voids out that i exist or that i'm a support system and i was looking for advice on that.

i know that i can only do so much and that there's no cure. but i wanna know how i can help when we get into arguments and she feels like i can't be there. she currently has no outside motivation aside from me (she dislikes all her family and her friends are not a priority). 

as a final point, i'm scared of the idea breaking up because i know the inevitable consequence and the guilt i'd feel. she has admitted already that if i'm not there, then she has no reason to keep going

any advice is appreciated. she's the person i love and care for the most and the increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts/tendency to act on those thoughts is alarming to me"
2214,I hope my departure will break my parents.,"I've seen lots of people here admitting that they don't dare going trough with it so as not to pain any loved ones, I'm not even there. I loathe my family, hate is the only emotion that makes me feel alive, and I've got lots of it inside. Oftentimes, I wonder if I shouldn't just off myself to bring them pain, that's how spiteful I am. I just wish I had the courage to actually go trough with it."
2215,40 is my limit,"That's when I think I'll finally end it, if things don't get any better. I need love but nobody will ever love me again the way I need, and I want a life that I can't have... I'm done with this life, and have been half-dead already for the last 4 years... I'm done. I've never attempted, but I have a plan and I make it a point to do things right when they matter. Part of me really hopes I hurt people who have hurt me, and part of me hopes I don't hurt anyone, but over all I am just tired of the pain"
2216,lol my last thing i would be doing before i go,"i have 200$ in my pocket and i will spend it all on fast food and things to make my body more sick and more unhealthy

my health is going downhill because of my bad eating ....
all i do is just sit on my ipad playing games and watching shows and eating like a fucking pig....lol

so soon after i spend it all i will kill myself
and thats final ....no one can convinse me to not do it

i hate everything , mostly myself 
im just holding on now ....just for one
more year or so....i cant do this anymore
this is all heavy weight on my already dead soul

have a nice day ...."
2217,i tried to kill myself in febuary. i want to do it again.,"i tried to kill myself in febuary, when i couldn't find the motivation to go to school. my parents belittled me and my dad beat me that day. i don't even remember why i didn't want to go to school. nothing bad was even happening. i just, lost the will to. i snapped that day, in a sense. i wrote on the wall with permanent marker, i got threatened to be stabbed with a knife and hit with a frying pan. i was prescribed pills a few months back for a physical condition i had, and when i broke, i drank it all. i even put a note inside the capsule and filled it with alcohol to smudge the ink.
nothing happened. it didn't even work. i didn't die. my parents read the note and yelled at me. my mom was even crying. it hurt me, but honestly didn't change my point of view on life.
now, my life is useless. i don't want it, i don't need it. nothing ever changed my mind on whether i want to live or not. i'm constantly making more and more decisions i will regret. my best friend tells me to stay positive and that i can get through it, but i can't. i smile, i laugh, but honestly i don't even know whether they were real or not. 
these past few days have been normal. nothing happens. i have what people consider a ""good"" life. i was always called smart and a good kid in school. i'm considered a ""gifted kid."" nowadays that isn't the case. i've been having anxiety attacks more and more often, i've been feeling more and more like shit as the day goes by. 
am i really gifted? i doubt it. i have no talents. even if i try my best, nothing goes well.
i am a disgrace to this world and i deserve to be taken off it. 
""no you're not depressed, you're always laughing at our jokes."" - said no one ever. i bet they'd say that if i told them.
my friends all have their own problems to face, and i don't think they'd even care if they didn't and i told them. i can't find help, and i have to seek it online.
please tell me what's wrong with me."
2218,I Don’t Know What’s Going On,"About two months ago, I was okay. I was super active, eating healthy, drinking a lot of water. A week ago, I started to think about self-harm and suicide more and more frequently. Today, I’m writing out my suicide notes to everyone, and am finalising the plans for my death.

It doesn’t even feel like *I’m* doing it, it feels more like something casual like getting a glass of water, or going to the toilet. I switch from freaking out and crying, to feeling nothing all the time. I have a big history of mental illness, but I don’t believe it’s ever gotten this severe (or at least I don’t remember if it did).

I’m hardly in control of what I do anymore."
2219,feeling slow,"been married almost 3 years. i love him so much. I worked to put him through college, and I got fired right after he graduated. He took a job 5 hours away from our hometown and everybody I know. We moved, with plans for me to attend a university nearby. had problems with anxiety early on in the semester and stopped showing up. now for the past 6 months ive been alone at home all day while he works full time. and we owe 3000 dollars to my school in addition to around 8000 in loans from my last university. I’m feeling sluggish and lazy. I can’t even do simple housework. I’m sleeping 16 hours a day, during daylight hours until my husband gets home from work. im gaining weight. I’m not showering. haven’t talked to another human other than my sweet tired husband in months. i feel like im slowing down and everything else around me is speeding up. I’m letting him down big time and I’ve ruined his life with my debt. but as it is now thinking about getting a job or going back to school makes me panic so bad. if I kill myself will my school forgive my debts? or will my husband be stuck with it just like he is now. im on medicaid, do they pay for therapy? would therapy even help if I could ever make myself make the appointment? i don’t want to hurt him anymore."
2220,This world is messed up.,"I love this subreddit but it’s really concerning to see so much pain and hurt in one place. To know how many people are suffering quietly without others knowing sucks, especially on just one part of the internet. To all the guys and girls out there I hope you find happiness."
2221,Before it gets okay,"This is just a rant, you can move along and reach out to someone else. 

What I'm going to say won't reflect who I am on most days but I'll say it before it gets okay. 

Today I just wanted to succumb and jump in the traffic in front of the house. I just held tight onto my pillow and let the weight of my sadness crashes my insides. I can't believe I'm making it, and near to the end of the year now too. I haven't died. And sometimes it's disappointing that I haven't. I always had a hard time dealing with conflicts, most times I wanted to just kill myself when they arise. And yet I'm here.  

I heard about Dazai Osamu and how he died at 38 with his mistress. Maybe I want to be that. 

Sometimes I think about how wasteful my existence is, and that I deserve to die and not be in love. I'm not working, I'm not studying, I'm nothing. Pitiful enough that my boyfriend wanted to chip in to support my life. Just a waste of space and resources. The definition of being replaced with a house plant and not making a difference. 

I know this will pass, it always had. I just want to ride it now. I kinda wanted to hurt myself too. And move on. Life sucks sometimes. I don't know why I'm thrown down here and have to suck it up. 

But most of all I hate how hard it is just to take the first step and yet I have to. It's just ridiculous that circumstances makes that so much more harder. 

I don't want to live and make mistakes and hurt people anymore. It really just don't make sense to be here fumbling. 

Anyway, I wanted to succumb. I wanted to sleep and never wake up. I just want to give up. I don't want to fight on to live. It's just too hard. Please just take away my life. I'm tired of hardships."
2222,Isn't fun being left alone on your birthday,
2223,"Drunk, have a social worker arriving in about an hour, should I let her find my body?","Basically title.  House is a mess but probably for the first time, I don't care.   I just need to get away from here.   I have the means and have eaten to slow down absorbion  and prevent nausea.  I guess I am just scared.  Help me"
2224,I’m killing myself next week,"It’s been a long time coming. Abusive parents, homelessness, abusive relationship, failing at life. I have nothing and no one to live for. It’s truly a miracle I even made it this far. I will be poisoning myself next week. I’m only waiting because I don’t have access to it until then, otherwise I’d go today. I’ll take it in a hotel room then fall asleep for the last time. I always thought I’d spend my last week blowing all my money and enjoying life for the last time, but even that seems pointless now. I’m just patiently waiting for an end to my suffering. My only regret is that I’ll die alone... the same way I lived. I tried so hard to be a good, kind, generous, loving person. I tried so fucking hard to the point of being a doormat. Turns out being a good person gets you nowhere. Good people suffer and bad people get everything."
2225,I think I'm going to kill myself in a week,"unlike a lot of stories i've seen, this is not a random mood drop where nothing makes sense. this is a well thought out, month long plan in which i've tried my hardest to have good days and find a reason.

nothing makes me feel solid, no matter what, i feel like water. i feel as if i've lost everything, including myself, and maybe it all started with grief but it's morphed into this large unenjoyment of life. i can't breathe, existing hurts and it's not even that i don't have friends. i have a lot of people that worry and care for me, perhaps it's selfish to take myself away from those people but it's also selfish to assume i'm not struggling too. i suppose this makes me an awful friend and person, i just lie to them everyday. i won't even be here for the things i promise.

i want to live, yet i find not a single reason to. so i guess i'm just looking for that here, i'm too afraid to tell any of my friends what i've been planning and i feel immensely guilty for promising future things while knowing i don't think i'll even have that. i don't need a reason for life, i need a reason for MY life. i'm so tired of everything, i don't even know what day it is anymore. the only company i have is online, i'm failing my classes when i'm homeschooled and i have no passions or hobbies. i don't know what i want to do in the future, i don't think i want to do anything at all, everything is so overwhelming

i want to promise those reading that it can get better, if it's a certain event that's bringing you down you can escape it and get better. you can get help, and it's hypocritical of me to say that i guess but i do worry for you too. i'm on here to tell somebody, i want to be saved, but i can't do it myself."
2226,I Still Think About Her Every Night,"It's been ten years now since I've been hugged. Or had any physical contact beyond a handshake.
All I want to do is feel loved.

I wish I could go back to all those years ago and be with her. Holding her close. Her holding me in return.

But we weren't meant to be. She wanted to be with someone else. Years together, but she marries him after being away from me for just a few months.

I wish I could go back.
But I've become unlovable. Stagnant. No reason for ambition. Horrendous. 

When I reach out, there's no longer anyone there for me. Quite soon, there'll no longer be me."
2227,Where is this sub?,"A few years ago there was a sub Reddit like this. It was for those planning on killing themselves and the time when they was gonna do it. I found that sub at the end of 2016, I think. People was saying they was gonna kill themselves for the new year. It wasn't really meant to stop the death, but a place where people can go to just say goodbye. 

Where the fuck is that sub at? I forgot the name. I like trying to talk people out of it, try to understand why they wanna do it. An if they do do it, know I tried to stop them, but at the same time.. see the end of their story. Knowing that will be me at some point. I can have a place online I can really go to say good bye. This is more of a sub to vent, and for people thinking about doing it. But where is that sub of people who are going to do it, do it?

I'm gonna do it at some point in like 15 years. There's no way out of this for me. If you know me, you would know the world isn't losing much. I think of them like me. I wanna be there with them, as I hope someone there is their for me in the end.

I'm gonna call 911 from a spoof number so they can't track my call before I do it. This way I have someone to talk to me as I fall asleep forever. I'll tell them my life story and not be able to finish it, because I'll pass out from the car fumes. Idk if I can't get a car, I'm gonna have to get a gun, but I don't really wanna shoot myself in the head, so I might have to do the heart. I don't know, I'll have to feel it out. I am black, so I can just go to Texas and reach for my waste super fast. I'll be dead in a flash. The cop will be white, so they'll be happy, get their power trip, and get away with it. That seems like a win win. I don't know. There are so much ways to do this. But anyway, whats the name of that sub?"
2228,people hate indians,I don't deserve to live and my genetics are fucked up. People compare my skin color to shit and discriminate on the basis of stereotypes that they've heard off and not even true. So I'm going to die on jan 1. goodbye
2229,I'm tired of existing in this system and I'm too concious about myself,"I just can't imagine becoming a sheep in this system with a 9 to 5 for life, neither can I change it or get out of it because you need cash to do so. But what really is my bigger problem, I hate myself so much. I regret everything I've ever done. But I even am aware of my situation but just cant seem to change it (didn't graduate school because I cant get myself together and missing a few months because of mental issues is somehow only socially accepted for girls). Now I work full time in elderly care and I just see everyday how I don't want to end up (old and broke and sick after working 50 years). What's also kind of funny I sometimes gave really bad anxiety attacks, I cant breathe properly my whole body is alerted but my brain is up there like: wtf why we doing this cant remember any triggers. I feel like my decisions dont matter because my brain will do something else anyway. I'm very sarcastic about life and everything because nothing really feels real, many people consider me funny and happy because I'm always smiling making jokes but it's more or less a way of self distraction. Like I've never had a real relationship because as soon as that person was coming uncomfortably close to me (mentally) it's like someone flipped a switch and I start treating her like dirt until she hates me, which leaves me in infinite amounts of regret and even more self hate (even if I crushed on that person earlier). I cant justify my own behavior to myself and that's the worst feeling. And I'm always zoned out like I'm just watching me in 3rd person. I know the order of my sentences probably makes no sense but I'm at work and just write down what I think about. I'm feeling this way since I was twelve, starting to realize how fucked up our modern world is and that I don't want to be a part of it. I'm 21 now and want to die on a daily but my mom and my 12 yo brother wouldn't be able to understand and be eternally sad, so I'll just live on til whenever...
In case anyone read this far, I'm in therapy since age 13 when I was diagnosed with add, got diagnosed with anxiety at 18 and now only see my therapist for drugs I can trade for lethal drugs or to students that want to graduate.
Now reading my shit here I can't believe how whack it sounds but English is not my 1st language and I needed a place I can honestly talk about stuff that I don't even talk about with my therapist.
If anyone read this far...I love you and hope you're having a great day (:"
2230,How do I regain my mother's trust?,If I can't I will kill my self by this night
2231,Why am I still here?,"This past year has been a fucking roller coaster on the emotions. Four different times I’ve came very close to acting on my plans to end my life. The only thing that’s stopping me is my dog. Out of all the things, I never would have thought he’d be the only thing keeping me alive. I adopted him from the pound and over the time I’ve had him, he’s became very attached to me. When I moved away to college this last semester, my parents would report back he’d search for me and mope around when he couldn’t find me. I don’t know if it’s the overwhelming guilt that my dog would be shattered or not. 

This time though, I’m actually a little scared. I flunked this semester, lost two scholarships which made college possible, and my parents are kicking me out. I’m afraid this might be the true end. I won’t be able to take care of my dog. I’ll end up inevitability failing him like I have everyone else in my life. 

With the situation hitting like it is, I’m having the hardest time sleeping as more thoughts of ending my life slip into my mind. Maybe I should just do the deed, and make the world a better place.

Anyways, sorry for wasting your time today"
2232,Everything Just Keeps Getting Worse,"GOD FUCKING DAMN IT

The past 24 hours have been shit, the past everything has been shit. I can't take it anymore. I fuck everything up. I failed my Chemistry class, I messed up my payment information and probably just lost $1000, I haven't slept in 48 hours, I have a final in a couple of hours that I will probably fuck up, it's fucking freezing outside, and I'm leaving the city I love tomorrow morning.

I just can't take it. I am an idiot and a failure. It's pathetic that I have fucked everything up continuously. I keep hitting rock bottom and never getting better.

I would have no issue with getting hit by a car or a train. If my final doesn't go well I think I'll go to the nearest metro station and just fucking end it. I have no reason to keep going. I just want to fucking die."
2233,I can tell you WHY this World hates you and I. It took me almost 9 years of Hell to figure it out.,
2234,My first time posting.... Just really struggling a lot lately and I don't know what to do,Suicidal and selfharm thoughts just keep popping up in my head and I don't know why my mood seems to be dropping significantly recently. It's getting harder and harder to cope and I feel so hopeless about my situation. It's just so tired to get on with living.
2235,Life is so fucked up that me a 20 years old is starting to get grey hair.,Haha lol what a miserable life.
2236,serious tw: im everyones problem,"i want to run away and hang myself somewhere nobody will find my body and blame it on themselves, because what was the point in me living anyway, im an autistic piece of shit and everyone hates me for that by default because im so fucking weird, im a fucking worthless trans boy who cant pass to save his life, whats the point? ill never live a life i want, ill never be biologically male. i want to kill this body so badly, all it has done is wronged me. oh and my fucking brain, im going to cut that up even more, ill rip it whole out of my head and smile before and after i do it, because ive never wanted the hassle of that stupid thing anyway. all that brain does is cause me and everyone else pain. i just want
to feel okay for once for fucks sake but
i cant have that an i fucking hate it, im such a lonely worthless hunk
of junk and i shouldve been gone years and years ago, im so sick of being lonely, if rather kill myself then ever be lonely again whats the point? why do i try? i truly am alone and ill be dead before i ever get the help i need

im so sick of the pain, im so done its all stupid

its all fuckimg stupid snd irs all gonna
kill me anyway

all ive ever wanted is peace but im not allowed that

ive never been a fighter and i never will be, im the weak and useless one of us all, and yet im the host??
what is wrong with them? why did they pick me?? im hopeless.. i dont want to be the host i want to be safe ive never been a leader id rather follow, as a follower i cant do anythimg wrong

im so tired of what im expected to be, im expected to be strong and have anger issues but thats juno, im expected to be good at acting and bubbly and socially confident but thats louisa, im so sick of it. i wish i could just tell them all that im not either..


but of course telling them
that would be another worthless battle in itself because suddenly im dangerous all of a sudden just because i mentioned that i have alters and im nothing that you cunts said i was, yknow suddenly theyre worried about us knifing someone or some shit, are you kidding, none of us can even put together a jigsaw together properly, you fucking flaming idiots, im sick of being assumed as one person, im sick of the bullshit and most of all im sick to death of failing people.

it seems like no matter what i do, what i say, what i think, everything i say think or do is always a problem to SOMEONE, someone will always find something to scream at me at,  even down to the way i speak alone.

i wish i could change how i am. i dont want to be recognized as autistic i want to be recognized as a human fucking being for once, but fuck that ever happening. i hate myself, i really fucking hatr myself. i wish i wasnt like this. i wish i didnt have all these bullshit mental problems, i wish i was never born in general, because from birth ive been everybodys problem. im only alive to keep people happy, because i already know that if i finally gathered the courage to end this pathetic mistake of an existence, id be an inconvenience to everyone yet again.

i just want to live alone in peace, with a body i can stand, a life i can stand, and a brain i can stand, thats all ivr ever wanted in life yet i doubt ill ever get it.

ill be dead before anyone even makes a half assed attempt to get me help before i destroy this body.

i know i have my girlfriend but in reality shes just another person im a failure to.


she tells me i dont fail her, she tells me she loves me and she would never hate me but is that really true, because everyone else on the planet said that and immediately followed it up with a list of everything i do wrong everyday.

and these same people preach at me for ten hours about how suicide is not the answer and all that bollocks, when less then half an hour ago they were telling me that everything i do down to the way i act and the way i talk is wrong and bad. oh, so suicide is not the answer then huh? then why dont you tell me how im meant to stop being a problem to everyone i associate with? huh? yeah. thought so.

im just an emotional punching bag for everyone, and can you blame them? id make fun of someone like me too. theres nothing about me that makes me easy to talk to or interact with. im hopeless. i wish i could stop being such a mistake. i wish i was aborted or died at birth. i shouldve died, because its miserably obvious i was never meant to be alive, and everyone knows that.

i wish i had the courage to do it myself. but let me tell you, if a car came straight at me threatening to take me, i would lay down and let it. though some fucker would probably save my life anyway and id curse at them forever.

i just want peace. thats all.

im going to be such a worthless waste of space as i get older as well, ive had no decent education, i cant commit to anything and my mental illnesses control my whole life, im going to be a deadbeat piece of shit forever, never going to get a job or nothing, or get fired from the job in the first two weeks. ill be either homeless and on the streets, hoping ill die in some filthy ditch soon if i take enough drugs, or ill be a waste of my girlfriends time and money. ill likely be in a care home when im fucking 30 because i cant move anymore.. my body is failing me in every way possible. i am destined to fail. and people say ‘thats not true thats not true’ but it really is, its just the cold hard truth.


im the kid that gets cropped out the school photos, and im sure my mom and everyone wished for some academic genius, not some pathetic multiple mistake like me.
nobody should want me.

im such a fucking disappointment."
2237,Can someone please be my friend?,I'm close to taking a bath and slicing my wrist open. Just to put off a final bath bomb because I love them so much and I haven't done one in awhile. Can someone please just talk me out of it. I have barely any friends and that means I have no friends online late at night. I'm sorry for posting on here again but I've just had a bad month.
2238,I'm sorry....,"I'm sorry that I must go. I'm sorry that I am a waste of space. I'm sorry that I cannot be there for anyone. I'm sorry that no one trust me. I'm sorry that everyone hates me. I must go and carry on , leave this life behind and make everyone happy by going away. I'm sorry I wont be there and graduate from college. I'm sorry I have been a person that people look up too. I'm I have been a jackass. I'm sorry that life is too short for people like me. I'm sorry for wasting the world resources. I'm sorry to be living. I just here wasting away m. Today is the day for me to go. No one can stop me from doing it today, well be leaving in the morning. I might change my mind but I highly doubt that now cause everyone hates me. Goodbye everyone i must go on and live somewhere else good night"
2239,identity,"i want to change my last name (actualy want to transcribe and translate in a different language)
i want to marry with foreign women
i live in a poor country here women are cancer and i am embarrassed of my nationality.


simetimes, i wonder ""how""
how to explain parents that im not into local savages and that most nice (all) women i met are total foreigners.
they treat it as if i wanna breed with an ufo driver. as if only bosnia s are white people ( yes im bosnian)


its not that they are exotic its that they come from happy places.
while i live in fuckistan."
2240,Everything keeps getting worse,"I feel so alone, now I really have nobody, I wish I was dead. I don't wanna wake up, I don't wanna be screamed at anymore, I don't wanna be afraid anymore, I don't wanna go to school. I just don't wanna be alive anymore."
2241,Does anyone else remember when they were traumatized and the sensation,Often when I look back at the moment I remember feeling an odd sensation around my eyes/forehead and on random points on the back if my head. Does this happen to anyone else?
2242,I wish I could be happy,"I’m constantly looking for things that make me happy. But I’m just not. When I get super down when the depression hits hard, I often wonder why I’m still here. All I want to do is help others and make them happy, but I constantly get shit on. Society is depressing on top of all my other mental shit that I can’t turn off. My head feels so heavy and overwhelmed. I feel like I’m just rotting away anyways.
I have a suicide plan but it’s too much effort when I’m this depressed. No winning in the game of life. 

Literally the only thing that puts a real smile on my face is the thought of dying. I’d do anything for someone to just kill me and end my burdens"
2243,I'm tired of waking up.,"Day in and day out, I keep fucking waking up. Why won't it stop. I'm done. I've lived way longer than I ever imagined. Can't I please stop now!? I haven't wanted this so badly in years. I'm so afraid of doing it myself that I just want it happen naturally or by accident whatever. I'm just so fucking tired."
2244,No Fear,"My depression has gotten rid of my fear.
I look at bad situations as good ones. 
I often go out to bars and start fights, cause he maybe my shit will end right there hey. 

When i'm driving, my foot goes right to the floor.
Then i wonder, how quick it would all end if i hit the ditch at 180km.

I'm scaring my family, i'm scaring myself."
2245,I don’t want to live but I’m too stubborn and angry to kill myself,"Its a very frustrating dichotomy. I for some reason am eternally doomed. Just found out I didn’t get too jobs I applied for this week. Havent successfully landed a job all year. And yet I don’t want anyone to win by me killing myself.

I hate every minute Im alive. I don’t want to be here. Everything is a bullshit farce built on lies and falsehoods. Ive tried to be honest and forthright in what I believe and it has doomed me to an existence of getting by but going nowhere."
2246,How to talk about it,"Yesterday I had an attempt,

Now I want to talk about it with someone in real life, but I don't know how to approach."
2247,PLEASE TALK TO ME,i cant stop crying i need help so bad why wont anyone help me???????
2248,I want to fucking kill myself,I just literally see no point in being alive anymore. Like what is the fucking point of suffering just to die? Like yes my parents and friends will be sad if I kill myself but they will get over it and I know it. I’m the fuck up anyways and they would probably be happier to see me six feet under than a failure when I’m older. I’m sad all the time. There’s this gaping void in my chest and I always feel empty. I go to therapy take meds and literally nothing helps. I just feel empty inside like a zombie going through the motions of life. the best parts of my day are when I get to fucking sleep and not face my problems. And there’s so much fucking trauma in my past and problems I have with myself that it would take me so long to get over them and finally be happy that when I do get over them I’ll be old so what’s the point in living? Fuck this life and fuck this world the earth is dying
2249,Basically how I feel.,"There once was a man named John,
he found no point in life and yet he persisted, 
he doesn’t know why, 
he felt that everything his and everyone else’s work will be turned to nothing,
Eventually,
He thinks the only thing stopping him from giving up is his sympathy,
But why have sympathy if there’s no point in life,
He thought that if he gave up it would greatly affect people in his family and his friends negatively,
And he didn’t want to bring such a burden to other people for his supposed “realization”,
He saw no future for himself, only living, growing, and doing a monotonous job for years and maybe having wife and kids, but he doubts that,
John wasn’t a believer of religion, but he thought a religion could give his life meaning,
But he didn’t even try it because he knew it wouldn’t work,
John wanted to end his boring life but he felt like he couldn’t,
And yet he persisted, he doesn’t know why and yet John did,
He feels he should tell relatives his thoughts and feelings to get help, but he’s so shy and scared what their reactions would be,
Every day late at night he thinks about ending his life, but in the morning,
When he talks to his friends and others, it is just enough to push him into the next day,
John feels he lives a boring life, practically wanting anything to happen, even something horrible to make his life more interesting,
All of the hobbies and habits that John did in order to make him happier have become boring,
But he’s still not ended his life,
Yet."
2250,"À tout le monde, à tous mes amis Je vous aime, je dois partir",
2251,Life is suffering,"I have no ambitions in life anymore. I went to college for two years and it didn't help me at all, then I dropped out and more than likely will never go back. That was about two years ago by the way. 

Now I am up to my ears in student loan debt because I can't pay for it, I cant get a job because I can't drive and I can't get a ride anywhere because my brothers and parents are working all the time.

I have been stuck thinking to myself for about four months that it would have been cheaper to kill myself rather than the 25k in debt I am in from going to college for actually nothing. My family is poor and it's really fucking hard to go to the fridge and see less and less food in it. I started noticing this back when I would be home from college.

I would rather run away from home and tell my mom and dad to stop paying for my debts, I mean what are Sally Mae and the others I've taken money from going to do? Find me and tell me to pay up? Fuck them. I'd rather be dead than live the rest of my life working dead end part time jobs at food lion (like my mom) than live the rest of my life in debt.

I've been genuinely thinking about ending it all but I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it or ask for help. So here I am stuck suffering by myself screaming at myself every day and every night about how much of a fucking failure I am to my family. 

My life ended when I was 16 and I'm only now seeing the fact of that at 21. I'm pissed and miserable every day of my fucking life, I don't want to write anything, I don't enjoy playing video games with my friends or painting warhammer minis or even playing D&amp;D or whatever we have been doing for almost three years.

Life is only suffering."
2252,Maybe this time,"It's been a year now since my last attempt. A year where I mostly just got by, surviving day by day, weekend by weekend. The good days are few and far in between. Clinging onto daydreams and foolish hopes, despite knowing better. But foolish hope is all there is. So I keep tricking myself, tell myself that people who explicitly showed no interest in me might suddenly turn around. And keep getting disappointed by my unrealistic expectations. Which I know are unrealistic, but again, there is nothing else. It is both keeping me from going insane as well as driving me insane.

Life is not getting better. Decades have passed since I was young and naive, and it's still miserable. Maybe I'll manage to finally rest this winter, when my brother is on vacation and can't stop me. Probably going to chicken out though, and let's be real, I'm not writing this post because I have solid plans, but mostly because I really don't know how to stop the hurting. It hurts so bad. And it won't stop."
2253,I took alcohol and pills,"Hi

I have been drinking a little bit tonight-- not much, just two or three glasses of some cheap Syrah

I took like 80 extra strength Tylenol PMs as well: 500mg Acetaminophen/Diphenhydramine HCl 25mg per pill if I'm reading the bottle correctly. 

I plan on going to sleep every I post this, and waking up in about three or four hours to go to school. I'm 5'3""; 140lbs.

I guess my question is, what happens now?"
2255,Whats it called when you gas up a car and sit in it to die?,
2256,I just had my first suicide thoughts. Really detrimental to my head.,"My exGF just called me earlier and told me that she doesn't want to get back with me and blocked of off all social media. I tried to apply at her job and get a position because that's what she wanted me to do while we were dating. She blew up at my face and says she doesn't wanna see me anymore. 
As I was driving back home, I wanted to drive off the cliff and figured she wouldn't even care if I got back home safe. I really just want to go away. If I can't even keep a girl happy then what's the purpose. That's all I ever wanted to do. She was my first girlfriend."
2257,"20 years old, ending my miserable existence in a month","Just tired of it. Hate having to coexist with other people, hate seeing other people alive and walking around me, hate being ugly and unable to at least get laid, hate literally everything about existence. It wouldnt be so bad if I could at least stay in my room 24/7 and never acknowledge another human's existence, but obviously I can't do that. So suicide is the next best choice.

Obviously don't say anything fake nice or anything attempting to dissuade me from doing this, because that is fake as hell and not meaningful. I hate you all, and you all are perhaps indifferent towards me, but indifferent in the sense that someone seeing garbage on the street is. You view me as unsightly, but not your problem. 

Anyways, hope you all have miserable lives, more miserable than my own. Peace out, and eat shit."
2258,There’s to much,"There’s just to much going on right now..
I’m not okay emotionally 
Or mentally 
In anyway shape or form.

I don’t even have my daughter most nights because I can’t take care of her properly 

I don’t want to be home at all. 
But I have no where to go...
I just don’t want to be alone because I am afraid of what I’ll do to myself ..."
2259,i wanna fucking get this over with god dammit,i can’t take this shit anymore the love of my fucking life is just gone he’s never gonna want me back and i’m gonna fail a class i can’t do this
2260,Can someone please talk to me before I do something rash..,"I don't have any friends I can talk to run or in general.. some stuff just happened with my boyfriend, and I feel like it's pretty one sided. I feel really trapped, and I just don't want to be here. I tried talking to him, but he's ignoring me.
I want to give up so bad. I hate being here, but I feel like I have no where to go. I don't think I can afford to live elsewhere.
 It'd be so much easier if I gave up right now"
2261,I hate this,Why me? I didn't deserve any of this.  Why does dad hate me? Why do so many people want me dead? Why do I want me dead? It's so cold and dark and numb here. I hate it. I didn't ask to be here.
2262,I can't do this anymore,"I haven't gotten out of bed once today. I haven't eaten. Haven't drank anything. Haven't studied for my final in the morning. I've just laid here crying. My life is falling apart. Pretty soon I don't think I'll have the money to continue treatment for my mental health. I tried venting to my friends about how unbelievably shitty I feel but they ignored me and changed the subject. I have nobody left to turn to. I'm feeling more suicidal than I have in years. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want this pain to be done, and it seems like the best chance I have at relief is offing myself. This world is shit and life is fucking pointless. I'm miserable. Nobody would miss me. If I saw another way to stop this pain I wouldn't want to kill myself, but it seems like the only way I'll ever be free of this fucking torment. I don't deserve to be alive anyway."
2263,I'm tired,"I feel so guilty everyday. I've escaped an abusive mother, and an abusive relationship. But i still think about killing myself everyday.

It's everyday. Nothing can even be wrong but it still creeps on me. The best medication has gotten me is thinking of i could kill myself instead of I should.

My bf is lovely. His family is wonderful. But i feel like such a fuck up for having no direction. 

I never expected to be alive this long nor did i want to be. My goal for my entire childhood was to kill myself before i turned 16, but here i am at 24. 

I can't handle day to day life. I don't think I'm cut out for it. 

I'm grateful for this sub reddit because i feel horrible when i talk to my bf about it. He doesn't guilt me or berate me but i can tell it hurts him. I've tried asking my dad how do you not want to kill yourself everyday as an adult and he left me on read.

Idk what to do. As sad as it sounds my cat was keeping me alive for years. She died 5 months ago. And her being gone crushes my soul. She was getting registered as an eso. I have her baby now.

 I just feel lost."
2264,I had potential long ago,"It saddens me to think about my younger self. I had big dreams and people used to view me as a smart and kind kid. Then life and my own stupid decisions stomped me into the dirt. I’m a failure and a fraud, a depressed loser with no hope of a good future. I’m crushingly lonely but I probably deserve to be alone forever. Dying alone without anyone really missing me after I’m gone is so terrifying though, that’s what stops me from offing myself I guess. Thanks for coming to my shitty ted talk"
2265,This is my only escape,"This is the only way to escape it all.

The illness, the loneliness, the hatred.

This is my only way out."
2266,I'm close to giving up.,The only thing that keeps me here on earth is my responsibilities to others but if I didn't have those I'm sure I would have made an attempt. My life feels like a prison with amenities. And many times I can pacify myself but there are some very dark bottomless moments where I just don't see the point in anything. I am lonely most of the time trying to stave off the oncoming depression but each day that goes by is like watching this avalanche of pure depression grow and I know one day I won't be able to run from it anymore and I will be eaten up by it with no way out. My friends and family don't know as I try to put a happy face for them knowing that they wouldn't be able to help me. So I write this as another form of pacifying myself in the hopes of possibly putting my feelings out there to out run the oncoming avalanche.
2267,What's the Point,"I'm not religious so nothing really happens after I die. 

I have no true family because I've fought with them too much and separated myself. 

My only friends are those I party with every few weekends.

I have a gf but she also has depressive issues. 

I'm a sophomore in college and a 4.00 student but I think I'm extremely depressed. I'm good at studying and hiding my true feelings towards anything so it's easy to make it seem like everything is ok. Since 14, I've hated everything and have always just told myself that it would get better. I'm now almost 20, and it hasn't. I'm ready to not have to do this anymore. 

I honestly just want to be happy. I've already got a plan to kill myself. I just want to blow my brains and sink into the abyss. I guess this is my last ditch effort to get help. I've got finals next week and honestly I know I'll get a 4.00 again but I just feel dead. I just can't shake the feeling that no one cares. 

I've had therapy for various reasons but it hasn't helped at all. 

I know that suicide isn't the right answer but honestly, dying may be easier than anything else that's available. I don't know if I can take fighting anymore."
2268,Help me control this,"I was doing really well for nearly 2 years, then it all started crashing down again a few months ago. 


This time it's really bad, to the point that I'm on max dose with my SSRI and a supplemental anti-psychotic. Worst part is that I haven't seriously self-harmed in years and years and years but now the urge has come back hard and strong. When the pain gets really bad, it's like I need to, and it's hard to stop it. And it seems to be escalating. I need to find some way to defuse it or redirect it, but nothing I've tried so far seems to work. I don't do the most common thing, so stuff like snapping elastic bands etc doesn't do anything. Actually, the elastic band thing seemed to make it worse. Google hasn't been terribly helpful so far.


So help me reddit: what tricks do you or people you know use to get out of the spiral that leads to self-harm? 


And yes, my counsellor knows as does my psychiatrist, and I'm going to be discussing some new options with my counsellor this week. But I don't know anyone who has actually experienced this and want input from people who get it as well as input from the pros."
2269,"Just remember if you kill yourself, you're going to kill people (internally) closes to you.","If you hold debts, mortgages, or loans,  it's going to go over to your family. It will make their lives horrible 

Your best friend or closes family will most likley (statistically speaking) commit sucide and then his/her family falls apart and the cycle of suicides and depression continues. Dead on the outside and inside. 

So as Blissful as this sounds it's probably the most selfish thing you can do. Reconsider, evaluate, and try to find some inner peace."
2270,"Build me up, buttercup",Make me larger than life. Make me wonder how anything could ever be better. And then watch me break it.
2271,Tarot reading,My RA did tarot readings for people in my dorm the other day and she said that one of my challenges that I might encounter next year is something that is self-destructive to myself. I know that that is pretty broad and it’s not guaranteed to happen but it makes me excited to think about it. I know it’s not good or exactly abnormal but yeah.
2272,pain in my heart,"hi guys how are you all doing out there.
i hope you're all doing fine. me i dont know where my life is headed. it feels all so empty right now. 
my relatioship isnt goin well right now. my girlfriend isnt really communicating much with me and its making me really frustrated. i think she's also depressed like me. she's not happy with her low salary job just like me.. i try to cheer her up but shes just not letting me in.i guess i cant blame her.. there's not much i can really do... im not a rich man, i dont have a car or anything. she wants shopping and travellin. i can feel her sadness because i too feel lost. We used to be so happy together when we first met, but i guess its true what they say, its only in the beginning, it doesnt really last.  
do you guys ever experience anything like this?

i dont really have any friends, shes my only friend, and it pains me to think about losing her. its so lonely right now, so quiet."
2273,I just found out that someone jumped successfully a few hours ago in the same place I was going to do it,"I figured it wouldn't be a big thing since the school always covers it up a bit, but if theres two, even if I use my backup it'll end up bothering people more. The whole point was to wait until friday night and minimize the amount of peole who might see and make sure I didn't fuck up finals week for my sister. 

It just feels frustrating because I thought I had this planned out right and ready to go but now I'm having second thoughts again. I keep trying to buy myself things and I already fucked that up when I bought way more food than I needed until I kill myself. Where the fuck am I supposed to go now"
2274,My parents are so abusive I don’t even think they would care If I just killed myself.,"I think about killing myself a lot, they have fucked me up so bad. The weird thing is.. my sister who is nearly a year younger than me feels the same way I do. We’ve both talked about it extensively together. She has called our mom evil and cut her out of her life, she’s the stronger one. I am weak. And since I haven’t yet, and their afraid I will cut off contact 100% like her, they keep buying me things. They Got me 2 cars &amp; given me thousands of dollars. But It can’t erase how much they’ve done.  So many years of physical &amp; emotional abuse. My sister, She got it even worse than I. If it weren’t for my loving husband I’d definitely kill myself on Christmas Day just to give them that memory for the rest of their lives.  I’ve even thought about going to prison by getting them back. But They are the ones who deserve to b in prison. I hate them. I always will. I will spit on their graves when they die. Evil people they are. Pure Evil."
2275,I don't know how to keep it together anymore,"I have no job, no friends, and no family I can rely on. I might be homeless at the end of the month and my area doesn't have the resources I need. I don't have any transportation to better my circumstances. I don't have to way to get a car for transportation to get where I need to. I don't have a way to get help. I just feel so alone. With it being near Christmas and all of this piling on top of me I just wish I was dead. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I don't have a reason to live."
2276,To note or not to note?," That is the question. Lol, but for real, I was actually just wondering if notes minimize the pain to loved ones, because I know they can bring closure. But i've also heard that notes can cause drama and complicate things after your death. If being kept short and sweet, and what types of things should I make sure to include and what types of things should I make sure to leave out as to not offend loved ones? Do you think making a will is appropriate if you are like 18-20? I try googling this shit and I get that automated *please call this number* samaritan hotline and shit. I hate how this stuff is taboo to talk about. Fucking hate it. Searching this shit up, and I see these articles saying *How to write a suicide note* or *Best methods to kill yourself* but it's just to bait emotionally unstable people to click on the link, and all the article talks about is how life is worth living and shit, and then they refer you to samaritan hotlines. They don't even give you an answer, its usually just a trick title. Anyway I gathered a bit of information, like don't make your letter apologetic or emotional, because that can just cause pain and guilt, but thats all I got. I understand if you don't want to give advice regarding this, cause its kind of against the rules, being pro S and all, but if you want you can DM me your opinions if you have the time. Thanks"
2277,I lost a former bf/dear friend of mine.,"A guy I used to date, we were best friends since high school and were a couple for almost a year, then broke up with me because I didn’t have the right standards. So we stayed as friends, I still love him a lot, and even supported him, when he needed it. He always tried to hide his feelings by saying that he doesn’t love me and such, but I feel like he still does but doesn’t want to express them. We got into a small argument today and he told me I was a crybaby and that I need to find happiness somewhere else, or find someone else which I don’t want to do. He wants to be alone because he has an aggressive behavior all the time, but he’s apologetic when he realizes his mistakes which I forgive him for. Now he’s blocked me on all social media because I won’t grow up (I’m 20 btw) and won’t stop being a crybaby, when I cry a lot it’s because I’m letting my emotions out. The suicide hotline doesn’t help either, I just want to disappear."
2278,Why,"I didn't choose to be born with this. And the only thing that helps me I'm shunned for. I try to be normal and people hate me. This is why I've tried to kill myself so many times. This is why I can't be accepted. These stupid god damn ovaries have ruined my fucking life. I can't be loved by my own fucking family, so what is the fucking point?! And now I have to go back in to that fucking living room and pretend like I haven't been staring at this bag of meds wanting to down anything within reach just to escape all of this? I just wish I was never put on this earth and I beg someday soon. I'll be taken out of it. I'm so tired of this fight."
2279,Hello. I am lost,"I’ve failed my finals, I’m getting dropped out this semester.


I was always a good student, my grades were always somewhere around 4 (the American equivalent is B). Sure, not the best, but everything came very natural to me. I never had any problems with any subjects.


I switched my school to a harder one and at the beginning I was the best student there. As my freshman year continued, I started to go down on grades. The program is too hard for me to understand, and I’ve started failing some of the subjects. Failing them made me discouraged to even try to get the situation improved, so they went down even more.


Then I fell sick for two weeks by the end of semester. All of the finals were delayed for me, but I wasn’t prepared for them anyway. I’ve tried to prepare very hard, but that only lead to burning myself out to the point where I lost my mind. My last week was spent in complete apathy, I would get 2 hours of sleep a night at best. Everyday when I got home I had a very big urge to cut myself, but I figured it’s not worth it and I have a chance.


I resorted to cheating on tests, and that actually helped me at first, some even didn’t need a help from the little notes I’ve made to write off of. But the last two most essential tests were failed badly, on one of them the teacher caught me cheating and left me with a 1 (American F) without any chance of improving the grade.


Now I step closer and closer to self-harm, the idea of scarring myself scares me no more, and the fact that it doesn’t concerns me.


I’ve failed my parents, I was the only kid that could lift my family up from poverty since my siblings couldn’t manage to do so. Now I feel worthless, My finals decide my chances of enrolling to a university on a free basis, if I don’t get good grades - my family won’t be able to pay for tuition, and getting a loan will only worsen their debt.


I am a burden, I don’t see any logical continuation of my life. The only reasonable outcome is ending all this. I don’t want to kill myself, I want to live! But I either end up seeing my household collapse entirely and live pay check to pay check working in a sweatshop of some kind or try to improve the situation for my family by discontinuing my life and reducing their expenses on my college, stuff I need, and other bullshit.


Please, reach out to me. There has to be a way out"
2280,Idk,Does anyone ever when they’re driving just want to like drive into a tree and kill them self or is that just me?
2282,About to have probably the worst weekend of my life,"I post on here quite often i’d say, idk there’s something peaceful about just venting about my many mental issues and constant suicidal thoughts to complete strangers anonymously. I’m a 2nd year university student, and long story short i’ve had problems mentally for as long as I can remember but what started as being sad in bed for a day or 2 in high school, or having one bad night every few months where i self harm and deeply think about suicide, has turned into me at my “worst” almost 24 hours a day and this has been going on for, not 100% of the time however, for the last 2-3 years. My mum has severe mental health problems to the point where the 2 times she stopped taking her meds she ended up in a maximum security psych ward, spent thousands of her savings and both times, especially the 2nd time I was convinced she was going to kill herself. She had issues when I was a child but I don’t remember much and from my point of view she was pretty stable.  So back to me, I really struggled with university last year to the point where I wanted to drop out but I decided to just tough it out and somehow I actually did pretty well. I was convinced that a summer at home is exactly what I needed and I would come back into 2nd year feeling better than ever. How wrong I was... i have attended about 5 total lectures and seminars this semester, and out of the 3 units that I take, there is a good chance I fail 2 if not all 3 of them. I’m not always depressed, there are rare moments where i’m happy or smiling but these feelings soon end and I go back to my normal state which is either suicidal or just numb. Act that’s probably the best way to describe myself, numb. I don’t want to die at all, but currently I don’t exactly feel alive. Anyways, I had a conversation with my aunt over the summer as I felt like I needed to tell someone and I also told her I was prescribed anti depressants. However both of my parents have no idea. My situation however has gotten so bad that my dad is visiting for the weekend where he wants to sit down with me and my aunt and for me to pretty much tell them what’s going on. I’ve gotten so good at pretending like i’m okay and just holding stuff in, that it’s become my natural response. But i finally think i need to come clean and let some of the demons in my closet out, and I am shitting myself. I am also shit broke and behind on my rent, and that’s a big reason as to why my dad has these suspicions and wants to talk to me. I have booked shifts at work all weekend in the hopes that I can avoid it but I don’t think I can, but how do you tell your parents to their face you don’t want to be alive, or show them the many scars on my arms and shoulders of where i’ve cut myself. My dad is the typical parent, he’s just normal and so are my siblings and my aunt and when she’s on her meds my mum is also extremely normal. My parents don’t really get me and the older I get the more out of touch i feel. But yeah this weekend coming up is gunna suck and I still haven’t decided how much of my problems I want to share, but the more I think about it the more I’m considering just telling them every single thing with no details spared, and who knows this just might be what pushes me over the edge and finally makes me end my life and escape from this purgatory i’m stuck in. 

Sorry if this was dark or depressing and I wish i could say even some of this isn’t real or how I feel but unfortunately it’s all real and exactly how I feel. Sometimes I look at my 3 siblings and I just think why couldn’t I be one of the normal ones, but I mean my mum’s condition was bound to affect one of us, I had a 75% chance of avoiding it but I mean I have always been pretty unlucky...."
2283,Heading toward my mental cliff,"The seesaw of bipolar disorder is getting to me. I've had a pretty good couple days, and today, the good old depression is coming back. I'm numb. Tired. Annoyed. Also perturbed that the last time I posted here, the one person that responded asked me if I enjoyed feeling suicidal. 

I can't be trusted with some innocent-looking stuff, cause I'd try to hurt myself with it. I can understand why people self-medicate; I almost just want to end it already. 

Fucking insane. I fear that moment where I'm at a twisted balance of lighthearted and impulsive enough to kill myself, and depressed enough to see its ""logical"" rationale. 

Also, screw editing. I'm tired. Hope someone reads this in spite of the time zone."
2284,Why I starve myself,"I’ve been struggling with depression for a while now, I’m an 19 year old guy who isn’t in college, and is unemployed currently and I’ve been starving myself regularly for around a year now, I don’t want you guys to think that any of my depression comes from my weight, it’s more of just the first &amp; worst effects I noticed, but I know real anorexic people struggle in much different ways then I do. I’m 6,2 and was 175LBS my senior year, and dropped to 120 as of now. (high 90’s was my lowest but I’ve managed to stay in the 120 as of recently) when I was a young teenager I would make lots of of mean jokes about things including suicide and depression, I’ve said some really bad things and been incredibly insensitive to people I’ll never get chances to apologize to. I’ve told suicidal people to kill themselves, I’ve told people with eating disorders there idiot, I’m  just not a good person. I like to starve myself because of this, I like to think about all the negativity I’ve put into the world while telling myself how I’m not going to eat for the day and typically stretch it out to days. I know I can’t change the past, I know the people I’ve hurt wouldn’t want or care for an apology from me, so starving myself makes me feel like I can at least balance the scale. It feels poetic to me, I told people how dumb suicide was and now I spend hours every day wanting to die. I’m at a point in my life now where I feel but lost. I don’t know how to seriously put this but I have nothing to look forward to, I’ll never be happy spending my life working some job I hate, I’ll never be able to look at someone I love knowing they can accept what I’ve done when I cant, I’d never be a good father and my kids would think I’m as bad as I think my parents where, and I know I’m going to die eventually, I have absolutely nothings to live for, I don’t have friends, my family thinks I’m the happiest person in the world, I can promise that as of now, I’m not going to kill myself and probably never will, I know that even though no one cares about me and I have no friends, nobody “wants me dead” and it would REALLY mess with people’s heads if they heard I took my own life, especially in the way I want to (hang myself in the woods making hearts with the extra rope[the thought/vision just really makes me happy]) but I know that people wouldn’t just “accept” my suicide the way I want, so i feel trapped in life, waiting to die, knowing it’s going to get harder and sadder until I just die from something that isn’t a rope, I don’t know why I’m posting this, I just really needed a place to vent I guess, or see what other people think, I can’t talk about this to anybody I actually know and I don’t even really know how to “talk” about it in the first place, I just hope you guys can tell me something"
2285,"it’s silly but im trying to live by the small things, yet still feel like the universe wants me dead and i need to do it a favor","not out of inflated self-importance, im just a bit superstitious and i keep seeing like, signs to kill myself, or that i am not worth keeping around, like, it’ll either be good or like an unnoticeable thing if i off myself.

whenever i find confidence or overcome something, something genuinely notably unlucky happens and brings me down to a bad place. i haven’t gone a span of 6 months without suicidal ideation, it wont leave me alone.

im currently at a state of hopeful acceptance, i might kill myself i might not, so i am trying to make my current time alive a little more worthwhile or easy on me. 

i think i was more hopeful recently that ill get better, but then i thought to ask a yes/no roulette wheel if i should kill myself and it kept saying yes, i chose another question to break pattern and that one would always get no. the other question being if id ever get contacted by a former friend ever again and it kept saying no to that.

i dont know what to make of this but its weird to feel even a silly internet answer randomizer wants me dead."
2286,Quality over quantity,"I am so tired of putting on a facade while my insides rot and atrophy. I’m tired of being a burden to those I love, not being able to contribute anything meaningful to the world, and being so painfully alone in my life."
2287,"Had a major surgery, landed me with chronic pain in my hips and legs.","I won’t be able to walk anymore. I’m getting a wheelchair soon. 
I’m 15. The pain isn’t going away. It’s been happening for almost two months now. The doctors say it’s probably permanent. I can’t hardly move. I really don’t want to live like this. The pain is too much and the idea of never being able to walk and do things I enjoy again is killing me. I plan on killing myself soon."
2288,Trying to get through the nihght,"I grew up in a very tumultuous house, my brother https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/ for anyone interested. I basically watched him starve almost ti death at the age of  3 and  his disease was especially prominent because it’s very rare.  

My lDad relapsed  after 9/11  my brother’s  birthday,m. He drove me and my little brother around hammered and got caught by my mom. I was devastated. Debut drunk after each relapse completely destroys.

Low and behold I’m an alcoholic too. I’ve been through the big book, doing the strides, I’ve been through 9 month rehabs and immediately again after. My mom memo I relied on most for support threatened to have me arrested since the basis that when she bought the car she didn’t notarize. Oh I also have 3+ grams of etizolam . And a liquor store maybe a 30 minute walk down

Or maybe a time portal sill open dropping a jet directly on my head.....

Thank you got"
2289,I’m in so much pain. I feel like I’m fraying.,
2290,I'm so tired. I've been suicidal since I was nine and it's back now. It will never end.,"I thought I was better. I used to be proud to tell people and therapists that I haven't considered suicide in two years.

I moved out of an abusive household, next Friday it will be a year of me living alone. I have a boyfriend, next Valentine's day it will be our two year anniversary. I got into the best school in my country, to the hardest career, and just dropped out. I applied for another college just two weeks ago, in a week they'll tell me if I was accepted. I see my mom every week, I love her and she supports me so much. She helps with my expenses so I can only work part time and worry less about not having time for school (I don't live in the US if that's important).

I have friends, I think. I don't see them too often, but I know they're there and they are happy when they see me. I semi reconnected with my abusive father and it's not that bad. I am no longer obese nor overweight. I think I'm pretty. My job isn't awful and I live in a nice neighborhood.

And yet...

I hate my body. I want to starve myself, but I feel so lonely and desperate I just eat everything in sight and then force myself to throw up. I've been spending all my savings on binge food that I end up vomiting.

I don't want to get up in the morning. I hate it. I get up, make myself some coffee and beg to have a bit of energy to get anything at all done, and at best, I manage to do one single thing. I'm exhausted afterwards. I haven't worked in two months. I'm blowing away my savings.

My boyfriend told me today, after I sent him a flirty meme, that I do nothing. I took it as him telling me I don't work or do anything all day. It hurt so much. I felt useless and worthless. I told him, good to know then, because I get my money from doing nothing. He later replied saying he meant I do nothing during sex, and that he meant it as a joke. That was equally ugly to me. I was so hurt, I let him know. He got mad, he won't talk to me anymore. He told me to forget about it, and some cryptic shit about him realizing ""stuff"" now that he refused to tell me. I told him alright, I'll forget about it, if you wanna tell me anything else here I am. He hasn't told me anything else, just left me on read.

I hate myself. I hate doing nothing. I hate feeling so exhausted. I just want to end this. I told someone and it didn't work. I straight up said I was suicidal and all I got was ""work out. Maybe if you look sexy you'll feel better"". What the fuck.

My boyfriend knows, to an extent, how bad it's been for me lately. He went with me to see a psychiatrist. He told me I'm always thinking there's something medically wrong that I can fix with pills, that I should just enjoy what I have.

I don't wanna tell my boyfriend, I'm terrified. Thinking about telling him, to me, sounds like emotional manipulation from my part. I don't wanna tell my poor mother. She saw all my suicide attempts growing up, from 9 to 17, and I swore to her I'd get better. 

I'm so afraid though. I have a bunch of pills. I'm afraid of taking them and waking up still alive. Living after a suicide attempt is so much worse than what I have now. I wouldn't be able to stand the looks of disappointment and sadness.

I don't know what to do. I see no good future. It's been so long, I'm out of my abusive situation, and things haven't gotten better. They never will, I'm afraid. I'm not good enough to live.

I feel so alone. I can't really be honest with anyone. I'm so ashamed of what I am.

They haven't given me my meds. My hospital says they still haven't been delivered to them. They told me maybe tomorrow. If I don't get them by Friday I might just end it all. I can't stand all this pain any longer. I am a burden and useless."
2291,Anyone out there?,Is there anyone available to chat?
2292,Your amazing,I’m proud of you and love you
2293,I am determined to kill myself if something doesn't change,"I don't have a compelling story or even any good reasons to kill myself. But I think I'm going to do it anyway.  It's all I've been able to think about for over a month. And I'm tired.

      I'll be taking leave for the first time in over two years to see my family and fulfill my sense of moral obligation. I've come to the conclusion that if I don't find a reason to keep living while I'm back in america, I'm going to kill myself. I've thought about it long and hard, whether or not I should keep hanging in there, but it's getting harder every day to count my blessings. 

     The only reason I haven't done it yet is that I have this leave to look forward to and I'm interested to see if I'm able to make anything substantially positive happen. Something to be grateful for, something that makes me happy, something that pisses me off so much I just have to stay alive to get back at it. I will accept literally any reason to sustain my will to live at this point. I will put effort into it, finding it, making it, whatever. But the environment I'll be going to will already be depressing and boring. Maybe I'll kill myself there. I feel bad about my family but it's not like I'll be around to care  once I'm dead. I'm not sure yet, I have plenty of time to decide.


     I can't talk to anyone about this or I'll be put on suicide watch and prevented from going on leave. I'm completely alone in this. I'm fucking up at work because of it too. I'm spacing out, not getting anything done because I'm always fantasizing about killing myself and I'll end up staring off into space and minutes and on a couple occasions hours pass by before I realize what I'm doing. My supervisors want to know why I'm not getting shit done, but I can't tell anyone it's because I literally can not stop thinking about finally going through with it. 

     But I'm scared, and I know I'll be terrified and panicked once I'm past the point of no return. I'll try to save myself, I'll do rash and desparate things that people do when their survival instincts kick in. But I'll get through it because I'm determined to get this done. 

     I don't want to die, but I want to not be alive even more. I know it'll hurt, and I know it probably won't go smoothly, and it scares the absolute shit out of me, but I'm determined. I'm going to be methodical and think about any rash decisions I might make to save myself. I'm going to at least get this right.

     I'll spare my family and the people in my shop the theatrics of a suicide note or even a warning. The hard part will be going a whole month in the presence of my family and not mentioning my intentions

TL;DR: I have a goal and a plan. Whether or not I do it all depends on how this month goes."
2294,I'm so tired. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 9 and they just came back. It will never get better.,"I thought I was better. I used to be proud to tell people and therapists that I haven't considered suicide in two years.

I moved out of an abusive household, next Friday it will be a year of me living alone. I have a boyfriend, next Valentine's day it will be our two year anniversary. I got into the best school in my country, to the hardest career, and just dropped out. I applied for another college just two weeks ago, in a week they'll tell me if I was accepted. I see my mom every week, I love her and she supports me so much. She helps with my expenses so I can only work part time and worry less about not having time for school (I don't live in the US if that's important).

I have friends, I think. I don't see them too often, but I know they're there and they are happy when they see me. I semi reconnected with my abusive father and it's not that bad. I am no longer obese nor overweight. I think I'm pretty. My job isn't awful and I live in a nice neighborhood.

And yet...

I hate my body. I want to starve myself, but I feel so lonely and desperate I just eat everything in sight and then force myself to throw up. I've been spending all my savings on binge food that I end up vomiting.

I don't want to get up in the morning. I hate it. I get up, make myself some coffee and beg to have a bit of energy to get anything at all done, and at best, I manage to do one single thing. I'm exhausted aft"
2295,I thought I was getting better,"I had a good day a few days ago. I think I even laughed at a show. I don't know why it happened, but it was temporary. I have hurt people I care about with my words and I don't want to have to face that. I'm scared to ask how big I fucked up and I just wish I would have done it before I said stupid shit.

I feel so goddamn edgy like I'm 15 again or something and I'm ashamed. I don't want to tell my family because having them worry won't do any good and I can't see how it'll help anything.

I'm sure if I hang in there there'll be another good day, but what's even the point of waiting for that? It's not like anything matters anyway."
2296,Hopefully this is the end :),"I’ve posted on here and like I’ve said before it’s a bunch of sob stories of my dumbass self but now again I hope tonight or even tomorrow I die. I’ve lost everything I’m ignored forgotten the name I’m referred to at school is “Who” or “that fat kid”  I was severely bullied through middle school and once high school hit I was left with the scars and everyday a lemon was squeezed. My life was and is still miserable. My parents are good people while I do struggle with them at times I think it’s normal for my age to but as for my sister. She deeply cared about me and now she is studying in a beautiful university in a wonderful country in Europe while I rot in my cell. I’m proud of her but at the same time I will never be as good or better. Everyone is better than me you the one reading this are better than me. I will never be good enough no matter how hard I tried vomiting, dieting, to a whole lifestyle change but it wasn’t enough to compete with others as I never fit the bill of bing the fit kid, the charming kid, the smart kid, even the gentle giant I couldn’t fit as I’m not tall enough but my height doesn’t bother me to much. My friends are living their best lives one is working to his goal as a body builder the other  is a genius who universities love. I only wish that I could go into the mind of another person and find myself and kill myself by ripping him limb by limb laughing at my stupid face and body as I cry for help and spit on his face for being a little piece of shit and bury him in shit because that’s what I deserve to be killed violently and be buried in shit. I hope by tonight or tomorrow my life comes to an end as I will never amount to anything and everyone is better than me."
2297,I'm afraid to actually do anything harmful to myself,"Sometimes I feel like someone is testing me. Seeing how far they can bend me before I break. Unfortunately for them I have an incredible sense of self-preservation... and fear. Although it there really was a puppet master pulling the strings, I wouldn't mind if they put me out of my misery themselves, rather than waiting to see if I'll do it myself."
2298,The crisis never ends.,"No matter what changes I make in life, I always end up feeling like I have a crisis again. It never ends, the pain just gets deeper...

I don't want to be here."
2299,"Maybe if I meet new people, things will get better...",You know why Im here... What Im thinking of doing probably... Anyone here from the Philippines? Lives on the NCR? manila? Can we go irl?
2300,It's all planned,"Ive had one almost successful attempt, one where I wasn't able to actually attempt it but everything was ready, and tommorow, if all goes to plan I will not be here to see Christmas. I'm excited, I have something to look forward to, for the first time in idk how long."
2301,I posted a few weeks about about ending my life.,"Since that happened, I got inboxed to do it and some other weird stuff, so I deleted my post and the app.
Anyway, since that post, I have had my third attempt. Basically, it is taking too much of my heart medicine and hoping I don’t wake up. 
This morning I woke up to my home are nurse over my bed and I was so sick from the meds.
I didn’t take enough. I spent the entire day hoping she wouldn’t catch on because she has been a nurse for over 40 years and we are very close.
It seems to never be the right time or the right amount and I think I’m sort of being shy about this.
I have a port placement and could just fill any syringe with anything and be gone. I don’t know why I lack the courage for this. I think I’m maybe working my way up to it.
I can get my heart to below 40 BPM and I am trying to get it lower and just go that way. But the meds make me so sick.
Today this nurse said she thinks I may have pre-diabetes or something that is messing with my already horrible genetic condition. No research, no cure.
I think, what if my doctor never bothered to check my sugar in these last four years and that that is what is making me so sick and just pushing me over the edge? But in the last I have tried to find reasons for my physical problems and have learned from a book that it’s the brains way of trying to make sense of suffering and illness.
My doctor gave me a recent 90 day supply of something I could easily take tonight and not wake up. They don’t even taste bad. I thought, wow, does he want to help me die?
That’s how messed up the mind gets.
Also, so me a favor and do NOT message me at all. I will just block.
Also, do not mention god or religious stuff to me."
2302,what’s the most peaceful way to go?,asking for a friend
2303,Is an exit bag the most peaceful way to die?,Considering drop hanging or exit bag. Drop hanging I can do immediately but exit bag could be less painful. Suggestions?
2304,I’d rather not participate in life,"There’s no reason to stay alive if my future will just lead me to poverty. It’s better to die young right now than have to live another 50 years of misery.

I’m heavily considering killing myself in a few weeks. I have decided that I don’t want to do anything with my life at all"
2305,"Im suicidal, depressed, etc. Anyone who feels the same please contact me, lets fight this together.","I’m 21 male, fighting this for a while.
I feel alone. I am not alone.
YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
I am here with you.
For everyone who reads this and needs someone to talk to: I AM HERE!
Depression is hard, it feels impossible, but it is worse when you are alone."
2306,Fix,"Why was born in this family? Why did my dad have his mind fucked up and have us go through all of this? All of this wishing it was better shit is so tiring. I hate doing this back and forth. I am so close to ending it all. This has been one of the worst years of my life. Fuck, this is torture. I wish I had two parents who worked and were both good models. I learned my habits from my parents, unfortunately. I don’t have an absent father but due to his mental issues after a car wreck, it feels like I do. This is not fair. The only thing holding my family together is God. But, God left me a long time ago. People like me don’t mesh well with that stuff. I am in a terrible place and fantasize about ending it all, every night. I don’t know how much longer I have to be “strong”. Another stupid fight on top of one of the worst days ever. I dream about being a different man who had a great family, friends and even someone to love. Somebody who means something to the world."
2307,I don’t know if I can fix me anymore and I think I’m done trying,"Probably not gonna kill myself because I’m a coward, but I don’t know if I can keep going like this. In fact, I know I can’t"
2308,PLEASE JUST KILL ME,I CANT STOP CRYING WHY WONT ANYONE HELP ME????
2309,i will never be happy,"i just have no idea what im suppose to do in the future. all i want is to be married with kids and have friends, but i dont think thats possible. every guy ive  been with has ghosted me because im not enough. my best friend of 3 years ghosted me because she got sick of me. most other people i used to talk to have ghosted me. i only have one friend left and i know at some point i will push her away too. after shes gone i will have no one and im afraid i wont be able to make new friends because i progressively get more depressed. suicide is the only path i see for myself. what if i made it to 30? id probably be a lonely alcoholic with some cats, going to a job that i hate everyday. maybe adopting a kid would give me some happiness, but thats not reasonable. it be wrong for me to choose to be a single parent, the child would have no father and no siblings. not only that, i probably wouldnt be able to afford it. so yeah i much rather end my life then watch it turn into a depressing train wreck."
2310,Being alive and seeing the pain I cause my parents is much worse than being dead and not having to feel any pain despite the fact that they would be devastated.,"I've accepted it. I'm not okay. I don't think I ever will be. I've tried. I've fought. I don't know why I should keep trying and trying when pain is the most familiar emotion. And this is all okay. This is all shitty and it sucks but that's okay. 

I'm not sure what this means. I'm not sure what I'll do. I'm not sure what I feel. I'm not sure about anything except that I'll never be okay.

However, the fact that I'm only going to get worse means it will make them feel worse, so I'd actually be sparing them in a twisted way if I did end it now. Two options:

1. Continue to get worse, and consequently make my parents feel worse as they see me get worse every day. 

2. End it now. Spare them 30 years of constant growing pain from seeing their son deteriorate."
2311,I think I almost died tonight?,"I don’t usually make posts on reddit, so I’m sorry if this is the wrong place for this, but I really need to share this with someone. I’m afraid of what will happen if I keep it to myself. It’s sort of long, but I’d be really grateful if you read it. 

I’m pretty sure I was about to kill myself on my drive home tonight. I’d been feeling pretty hopeless and lonely the whole day. My mom wasn’t texting back, the one friend I have didn’t either, I started the morning cleaning up a massive amount of dog excrement in my friend’s house (I’m housesitting this week and their dogs shat up the house overnight), and I went the whole day without having a single bit of human interaction. I’ve been feeling casually suicidal for a few weeks now, nothing serious, no plan or anything. Just hopelessness and hatred for myself and my life. I’m terrified of death but living has been really unbearable for a few years now.   Sometimes ending it is a really seductive thought. I haven’t told anyone about my thoughts because I guess they just seemed fairly insignificant. I just occasionally feel like dying. Doesn’t everybody? 

I felt so numb today. I’m depressed so that’s not unusual for me but today was worse. I don’t know what’s more pathetic, the fact that I all I wanna do is cry, or that, despite that, I still can’t. 
I stopped by my friend’s house to feed the dogs and lock up for the night, and on the drive home, I saw a telephone pole on the side of the road, right before a curve. Something came over me and all I wanted to do was drive straight into it. I almost did. Luckily I realized what I was doing and turned at the last minute so nothing happened. But damn. I was so close. I really thought I was gonna do it. That’s never happened to me before. I’m only 17. 
Once it hit me, I started having a panic attack and had to pull over to calm down. I’m terrified right now. It felt like I didn’t have any control over myself in that moment. I’m afraid that I’ll try to do it again next time I drive my car. I don’t want to tell my parents or my therapist because I’m afraid I’ll be sent to the hospital. I can’t call a crisis line because I know that’s all they would try to make happen too. 

Part of me feels like I shouldn’t even post this because it’s not like I made a serious attempt or anything, and it’s shitty of me to think I’m as deserving of people’s time and energy as someone else who posts here. 
I don’t know what I’m hoping to get out of posting this. I think I just need to tell someone without immediate consequences. If you got this far, thanks for reading this. 

Might as well take the opportunity to dump the rest of my feelings while I’m here. I just finished high school. I tested out early like the lazy, underachieving piece of shit I am, and I hate myself for it. I could have done so much better. I never struggled to succeed in school but I got depressed after I came out and my grades dropped. I transferred to an easier school with the intention of finishing my remaining credits and getting the fuck out of this tiny ass town, but instead I fucked it all up and decided to test out because I couldn’t take it anymore. I’m such a fuckup. Everyone always tells me I’m so smart, but it’s a lie. I’m an idiot who won’t ever make anything of themself. I had so much potential and I wasted all of it. Now I can’t go to a 4 year university until after community college (as if I could ever finish cc either. I’ll probably fail and never even be able to transfer), and I’m stuck in this shit hole of a small town for at least two more years. I’m a butch lesbian living in a tiny, conservative town with nothing interesting to do and no one who wants to know me. I feel so unsafe here. I don’t want to be the victim of a hate crime (unless it puts me out of my misery for good). My father is an alcoholic who doesn’t give a shit about me. My brother is in the Air Force and on the other side of the country. My mom loves me but doesn’t know how to help me, or even what I need help with. I’m drowning in gender dysphoria and I feel so alienated from my own body that I disassociate sometimes and don’t recognize my own reflection. I identify as non binary because I can’t be sure whether I’m a man or a woman and it kills me. I’m so uncomfortable with being seen as a girl, but I don’t relate to or feel like a boy (most of the time. Here and there I really do). I’m stuck in this in between of hating my body because it isn’t right, but not knowing what actually would be right. I feel suffocated, trapped, and claustrophobic in this meat sack. I’m miserable and I. want. out. I didn’t sign up for this shit. I wish I hadn’t been born. Now I’m trying to get people to use they/them pronouns for me, because hearing she literally makes me feel so bad about myself I want to die. I kinda want people to use he/him for me, but I feel like I don’t deserve that because I don’t totally pass or identify as male. I have anxiety too. Sometimes it gets so bad it seems like the only way to stop it would be to die. 
I hate that I can’t make up my mind about being alive. I kind of want to live I guess. I also want to die. I don’t know which urge is stronger, except for tonight. The latter was definitely stronger tonight. I’m not going to actively do something or plan to kill myself in the immediate future, but I worry that I’ll do it impulsively. How the fuck do you cope with that? How do I make these thoughts stop? Please help me out here. I don’t know what to do."
2312,I fucking hate my life and I have no reason to.,"To an outsider looking in, I should be happy with my life. But I’m not, not one tiny, minuscule bit. I feel like my friends don’t really like my and my parents don’t really love me. I can’t think of a single person who would miss me if I was gone. And I’m basically living an existential crisis every single day. I have no idea what I want to go to college and have absolutely no drive to go to college at all. I feel like my only option is the military or death and death seems much more appealing. Every waking moment I think about killing myself and how. I’m basically the living “funny kid coming home from school” joke. I always try to make people laugh and joke around but to the point where I don’t pay attention in school and get OK grades. People literally come up to me and tell me “Damn bro, have you ever changed? I used to be just like you but now that we’re in high school I just can’t fuck around like that anymore.” So I’m left being the entertainment for a class period then not being thought about until the next day. I have no real reason to even be alive other than I don’t have the means to end my life. I feel purposeless and cant find a reason to continue my life. I want to stop the constant mental agony that tortures me every second of every minute of every hour of every day. The only thing I love in my life is football and music, neither of which are real options to spend my life on because I know only a select few talented people make it to the top of those two things and I’m not one of them. I’m a piece of shit who doesn’t do good in school, is either hated or ignored, and has no future whatsoever."
2313,Haven’t felt this low in years,"Had a nasty, awful breakup with my girlfriend of 8 months the other night, who happens to be a co worker and my neighbor, about a 3 minute drive down my road.

I miss her and it’s so hard getting over this. She did things that are unforgivable and I said things that are unforgivable.

I have to go work with her, and will be standing next to her all day tomorrow. I have to wakeup early to take a final. I can’t sleep with all this pain.

I just want to be in her bed with her watching movies. I wish she never did what she did and I never said what I said. But it’s over. That bridge is burnt.

I’m not going to be able to avoid looking at her tomorrow, and I’m probably going to have a hard time not talking to her, or trying at least.

I’m so lost. I’m in so much pain. I just want to feel nothing again. I want to be gone."
2314,I wish my day dreams where my real life.,"I've always day dreamed of being very good at things but in real life I'm garbage at everything.
Day dreams are usually  Making my own anime,having my own cat quest online game (i still play cat quest online in my imagination) and some other games. hacking,having superpowers,being in my favorite book series of all time,being in anime,(there food is so delicious looking) being with people i like that i've ment online. its gotten to the point where everything in my real life feels fake and everything in my fake world feels real so if i killed myself I'd be doing myself a favor. and that is only the day dreaming part which is a lot of the reason i want to die.
I can never pay attention/concentrated on stuff because if i try to concentrate i get very panicky on the inside and i can't pay attention because of the day dreams. I've told my mom that it doesn't matter if I'm playing video games i still can't pay attention to school work (im home schooled so shes my teacher)and she just said don't be a dodo(or at least something around that) no one understands my mental health issues."
2315,I'm not okay. And I'm okay with that,"I've accepted it. I'm not okay. I don't think I ever will be. I've tried. I've fought. I don't know why I should keep trying and trying when pain is the most familiar emotion. And this is all okay. This is all shitty and it sucks but that's okay. 

I'm not sure what this means. I'm not sure what I'll do. I'm not sure what I feel. I'm not sure about anything except that I'll never be okay. Alright. I'm done typing."
2316,Peace,"I fantasize about the after life. Of not having to worry or struggle. 

Researching the way I’ll die brings me peace. Like this is my key to freedom"
2317,Just can't do it,"Recently went through a break-up and it seriously made everything worse. I've always had suicidal thoughts and pretty much no self-worth, always felt like a nuisance, wish I was aborted yadda yadda yadda, that stuff. Pretty much the norm for me, these thoughts go all the way back to like 4th grade, so for me to have to rant to strangers online? shits getting real serious. I've actively tried getting help, just went through my first counseling session and it was pretty nice. Also taking phenibut to help me function bc I got finals tomorrow and I'm also pretty stressed out, idk why I'm here wasting time. I know I have people out there who love me, but I don't deserve it, any of it. My ex boyfriend still loves and cares for me, he just says that it can't be romantic and he doesn't love me the same way so it would be unfair for him to keep dating me. It was my first actual/real/serious relationship, I invested everything in it, it wasn't perfect but it was probably the happiest time of my life. I grew up in a problematic household, my mom is sort of emotionally abusive and my dad is quite distant, so I have massive abandonment issues and this really made it worse. I love him wholeheartedly in all sorts of ways, as friends, lovers, all that stuff, if that makes sense, I'm jsut not very good with words. I feel like I will never be able to love someone like that again, fuck romance it's so overrated, it's all just infatuation and it never lasts. It has always been so fucking difficult for me to have feelings for anyone, so this was an extremely rare case and now that it's over it's probably never going to happen again. And I'm fucking glad because I don't want to go through any of this shit again. I've always had a plan to die at some point after college ends, preferrably alone, painless, and pretty, all dolled up and everything, so when my ex came into my life I had to put it to a stop. Now that I'm single it's up and running again, maybe I'll die in my 40s, idk. I wanna get filthy rich to take care of my parents (because they deserve so much better than what they've been through their whole life) and maybe hire a hitman or something. okay rant over back to linear algebra haha Just can't kill myself I hate physical pain so much"
2318,My ex stole my car &amp; I can’t report it stolen,"The police told me this is considered a civil case I have to send a certified letter and after ten days I can report it stolen. I don’t know how to accomplish this. I don’t have a proper template. Also, she listed her address as my address so do I mail it to myself? After ten days do I just pull the thing out of my mailbox and then call the cops?  The whole situation has left me feeling helpless.

Everyday she shows up at my house which I don’t have a key to but she does and threatens to bash my head in with a hammer if I don’t give her money. (She’s a meth addict.) So I plead for my life and give her my debit card and she leaves with my car to pull cash out of the atm. I have been trapped in my home for six months but the police won’t help. I wish I owned a pistol to blow me brains out."

of ruining my life with every choice i make 

i keep fucking up and it’s like i’m watching myself in third person just ruin e v e r y t h i n g 

i think my boyfriend is finally going to leave me since i’ve been not getting any better 

he says i’m not making any progress and i’m not trying and who am i to disagree ? i don’t even know how i’m feeling or what i want most of the time so he’s probably right that i’m lazy and don’t care enough 

i have to go pick him up in a few hours and honestly ?? if he’s really going to leave me this time i think i’m just going to stop fighting it, wait for him to leave, clean up enough so my mess won’t be too much for my mom to deal with, and just drive my car off a bridge. there’s 3 within 10 miles i can think of

i’m so so tired. i just want to sleep. i just want rest. i want it to stop."
2321,Wanting someone,A female person to talk to maybe keep tabs on me and hopefully be friends with in time. Idk I am tired of writing long posts that dont get any attention. I admit I have multiple plans to successfully work. Idk I am feeling really down and it's not getting better

Yeah. I know, crazy. But the biggest problem I have is pushing college work out of the way for these shenanigans. I have 3 giant essays due by the 14th, and if I don't get them in on time, I will fail the year.

I've lied to my family and friends saying everything is okay. I've been in the psych system all my life and It's turned to me having to pretend to be okay just to get by. They think I have all my work done, and I'm a perfect student. But it's all wrong. I'm gonna fail soon and I don't know how to cope with this.

I'm so scared. Are there any good people I can pay to help me get my work done? Any forums?"
2323,PLEASE HELP ME,i cant stop crying i need help
2324,Call me if you need someone to talk to. (740) 255-1085,
2325,I think about suicide every day,"Every day I think about how I could finally feel at peace. My boss wouldn't yell at me over things that aren't my fault, my mom wouldn't constantly put her burdens onto my shoulders, and I wouldn't have to go hungry because I'm so broke. I could finally stop feeling like a failure. Like a nobody. History would forget me anyways. I don't care if it's selfish. It hurts so bad. I don't know how much longer I can take it"
2326,"Every single night, when my parents are asleep, I cut myself with our sharpest knife, waiting for the day I'll muster enough courage to lacerate myself deep enough to cause my death.","I know it won't be tonight, and probably not tomorrow, but I can't wait. It also gives me something to look forward to everyday. Every morning, thinking ""today might be the day I stop existing"" fills me with anticipation and gives me just enough energy to maintain a façade of happiness."
2327,Goodbye,I've decided that I'm doing it tonight. My first day at my new job and realized that I can't do this anymore. I don't wanna jump from one retail job to another. This isn't what I want my life to be. This doesn't make me happy. I've accepted that I don't really have a purpose and I'm fine with letting go.
2328,Efficacy of generators,"Used to think a car and a garage would work but with modern emission systems it seems a bit tougher.   And a hose from the exhaust to the window is neither convenient or inconspicuous.

Thinking smaller what about a small generator inside a car? They’re carburated so it would sound reasonable to assume the emissions would be more effective but if engine needs oxygen to function, what would be the point that the generator would stop versus the amount of carbon monoxide produced versus how long it would take to be ultimately effective?  This could be accomplished almost anywhere due to the low visibility since it would be all inside the car."
2329,Fear of suffering,"To preface, I’ve been going to therapy that’s offered at my university and I feel like it might be helping somewhat, but I’ve only had a few sessions. 

My family has a history of mental health issues and my childhood was a bit screwy and I’ve multiple family members that I don’t talk to because they’ve been consumed by drugs trying to fill a void, and they only depress me more. I feel pretty much alone in life. Luckily I’ve found some decent friends that let me stay at their parents houses during breaks and stuff so I haven’t been homeless again.

I feel like as time goes on my bouts of depression just become more intense and last much longer and the migraines become worse and that doesn’t exactly make me feel optimistic.

Mainly what I want to say is that I’ve become absorbed by thoughts of ending my life, but the only thing that prevents me from doing that is fear. I fear the pain that my ideations would inflict or the potential worsening of my life should an attempt be unsuccessful. I don’t want pain, I don’t want cutting. When I cut I do it because I’m looking for quiet because it drowns out all my other thoughts, I don’t enjoy the pain.

I want to die but I’m afraid of death, and I can’t stop my self from hoping I can get over that.

A few students have killed themselves in the past month and it has just had me thinking, why haven’t I? My therapist thinks that it’s a good thing that I have these fears simply due to the fact that they’ve acted as a tools for keeping me alive, but I can’t help feeling like I’m a coward, I suppose."
2330,don't know what to title this,"Where do I start? I've been depressed for years now, mostly because of my father and his constant bitching and emotional abuse. He constantly treats me like garbage, and has said on multiple occasions that I was a mistake. I do damn near everything for that lazy fuck because he can't be bothered to get out of his recliner to do anything other than piss and shit, yet he still treats me like trash, degrading me every chance he gets. He constantly insults my physique, and tells me that I am going to die alone because I'm ""so fucking unattractive, not even a f*ggot would fuck me"". He screams at me that I'm not ""earning my keep at *his* house"", while he spends all of our family's limited disposable income on marijuana (since he has a med. marijuana card). And on top of all of this shit, almost all of my so-called ""friends"" make jokes about my situation, telling me ""just lighten up bro"", or ""get a sense of humor man"" when I take offense to them. I have attempted suicide because of these combined factors twice now, and have thought about it countless other times. I've only got a couple of friends that I can actually talk to about this shit, one of whom I've had a crush on for some time, but he isn't interested in guys; so I've wanted to tell him how I feel, but I'm petrified by the idea that he'll be disgusted by me and stop talking to me. I think the only reason that I'm not in a grave yet is because it would upset my mother and my two *real* friends.

Welp, that's all for my bitching, just had to get that all out."
2331,"I kind of want prison for life just so I can stop trying, dont need to work and can wait to die",
2332,Tried everything to get out of this,"I am sapped. If we believe that love and beautiful things all happen due to fate, surely this must be fate too.

I'm tired of sharing myself, and I know I've never been cared for. But I figured I'd be able to make something happen anyways. Eventually something would help.

I've tried it all. Everything. I've even tried dying, but haven't been able to quite pass the finish line. That's all that's left to try, I guess.

I have nothing to lose. Maybe."
2333,"Call me if you need help or someone to talk to, I’ll help you out of any problem.",
2334,I’m here to talk,"maybe by helping someone, it would help me help myself. If anyone needs anyone to talk to, please reach out."
2335,Meltdowns :(,"I have these meltdowns every now and then where I get extremely sad, hopeless, and suicidal. After my meltdown I go to sleep and wake up the next day feeling embarrassed that I had a meltdown, and the memory of it feels very surreal. It’s almost like I wasn’t there conscientiously. That’s about the best way I can explain it, any guesses as to what this might be?"
2336,I need to kill myself to give my mom and stepdad peace...,"They have been happier with each other than my mom was WITH my dad, so that tells me im the product of a mistake, like im not suppose to be here. i am also very lonely, so maybe that is life telling me i need to die. what should i use to die?"
2337,I’m close,"to attempting. it’s the right cocktail of sad and numb and self-loathing. 

I want out. 

see ya"
2338,I went to the grocery store,And didn't feel like offing myself even once in the entire 15 minutes. Small victories.
2339,I finally reconnected with some old friends,"I talked to an old group of friends today. One of them I've reconnected with for a few months but i finally got to talk to the whole group, and i felt something other than loneliness for once."
2340,Seeking Advice &amp; Insight as to How to Go About My Situation,"Today was a major trigger for me. I’m pretty positive I failed a major final exam that was going to, in a way, determine my future (career wise). Did I study? Yes. Properly? No. Which is no one’s fault but my own. I’m aware of the ways in which I self sabotage and I hate it, and myself, with a passion, but I’m not actively taking the steps necessary to make a positive change in my life (or at least not anymore).

I’ve been dealing with mental health issues and disordered eating for around a decade now, and this time, I’ve really reached my wits’ end. Due to my mental state &amp; drugs entering my life at 18, my grades from high school to college plummeted, and I’ve transferred colleges a few times now, only to end up at a school where I’ve never felt so alone. As a result, I’m watching everyone around me succeed and those I started college with nearing graduation, while I’m digging myself into a hole that I’m honestly not even making much of an effort to get out of. I’m just so exhausted from dealing with my emotions and myself.

I’ve decided I cannot do this anymore. 

I’m simply not cut out for this life. All this emotional pain, for what? I treat people around me better than I treat myself, only for karma to reward me in the shittiest ways possible. I’ve had enough. And I don’t see any way out of this besides killing myself. 

I’ve already been hospitalized twice, only to have my parents be extremely angry with me (mostly over the monetary burden it caused, as my insurance - that my parents pay a lot for - actually pays for nothing in regards to mental health) and hold a grudge about it, even ‘til today (the last time I got out the hospital, they told me they were done with me and wanted nothing more to do with me. Out of anger, I suppose, but there’s obviously some truth in regards to how they feel, hidden within their statements). So, inpatient is not an option. Towards the end of this past summer semester, I began seeking counseling through my school, only to have them refer me elsewhere after 5 sessions because they were “not equipped to provide the necessary resources” I “need” to get proper help. I reached out to the cheapest option on the list a couple weeks ago, only to be told that they do not have openings for therapy right now and won’t until earliest mid-January. So, therapy isn’t an option. I don’t have anyone in this city that I really feel comfortable opening up to, as none of my actual friends live here. 

Here are my options: (1) continue to over share on my “close friends” story as some sort of outlet, but never actually talking in depth about how I feel, so essentially continue to suffer, or (2) end my life so I no longer have to feel this way.

However, I have some reservations about suicide. My few closest friends have already told me that if I were to die, it’d really fuck them up. That’s in addition to my mother who said she would die from sadness if I killed myself, and before she would die, I know she would make the life of everyone around her a living hell (more than she already does). So, the suffering of my friends and family would be my fault. Also, isn’t death extremely expensive? Not to mention, I’m stuck in an apartment lease that doesn’t end until July 2020, and I’ve racked up ~$2,500 in debt from emotional spending (that my family has no idea about, but I’m slowly trying to pay off). Who’s going to pay for those if I’m gone? So there I go again, being a burden to my family (mostly my dad who basically pays and arm and leg for my existence). 

But, what do they expect me to do? One of my best friends already told me that I trigger her every time I talk about my mental health. So, apparently, but ultimately not surprisingly, I’m triggering. Therefore, I can’t even call the few friends I do have, because it’ll just make them feel bad. My parents ask me what’s wrong every time I see them, and get angry when I don’t say anything, but the few times I have told the truth, I was met with even more intense anger and long lasting resentment (African parents, go figure). My “support system”? Nonexistent.

Before anyone tries to hit me with the “you’re so ungrateful”, “so many would kill to have your life”, “your bills are taken care of, stop being a brat”, etc, etc – I KNOW, OKAY? I’m fully aware that I am blessed that I grew up in a family where money wasn’t usually an issue. I could be a refugee, or a religious minority facing persecution in China, but I’m not. I get that. And I’m thankful for what I have. But that doesn’t negate the immense emotional trauma that I’ve experienced throughout my life as a result of my parents (my mom, mainly), my former partners, &amp; some that I once called my friends. Hardship is relative to one’s existence. And right now, my head is causing quite a lot of suffering.

I want to do it a week from now. Because this weekend, my older sister is graduating from her graduate program and our family has to go out of town for it. She’s been through a lot during her life, so she deserves this to be a happy time for her. But, Christmas is around the corner, and my younger brother &amp; dad’s birthdays are at the very beginning of January.  My death would obviously taint those. Would that be too cruel? I feel like it’s a stab in the back, then also twisting the knife just to make it worse. But I’m not okay, and don’t foresee myself being okay anytime soon.




TL;DR: A trigger has brought up intense suicidal ideations. Therapy/Inpatient isn’t an option, due to monetary issues. I have no support system. But I have empathy, and killing myself during the holidays and right before a couple family members’ birthdays seems too harsh. What should I do? Any insight is welcomed."
2341,don’t know what to do,"my boyfriend just got taken away by paramedics and I don’t know what’s wrong with him but seeing him in so much pain made me want to scream and it’s bringing back old memories of my dad dying and I don’t want him to die, I just want him to be okay, and I couldn’t go with him because of my stupid ass job and I tried to call my sister about it and all she did was make me feel worse because every time I call her she just has to find something I did wrong and belittle me the entire time and my boyfriend is the only person in real life that cares about me and if he isn’t okay or if he dies I swear to god I’m going to just blow my brains out because I’m fucking tired of everyone I care about dying!! he was perfectly fine today, why couldn’t he just stay fine! I’m so fucking stressed now I don’t know what to do with myself"
2342,I’m one trigger away from committing suicide,"I started new meds awhile ago and they turned my suicidal thoughts into suicide attempts, multiple over the last few weeks in fact. I feel absolutely empty and emotionless and I’m currently debating what the most painful way to commit suicide would be just so I can feel something before I go. I need it to be a sure thing this time though. I’m not looking for advice obviously, I just want someone to see this and know what happened to me."
2343,My parents and friends don't get how fucked up in the head I am,"I'm tired of getting 0 sleep and working 8 hours and bullshit a pretend nice/happy face on people - sure, the mask is nice and all, but that shit is draining.

I go home and I'm a miserable prick (depression, anxiety, ahdh, asd is all fun) and I get in fights w/ my parents who I really think are just trying to help me but don't know how to properly because of well, how fucked my head is.

Therapy helped a little in middle/high school but that shit plateaus. I've tried drugs and yeah it's good to keep the edge off but it's not a good ""fix"".

thats not at all to mention that I'm drowning in student loan debt at a dead end job - I'm job seeking to find something higher paying but I dont want to leave so soon that it looks like I left on bad terms
but yeah I'm barelyyyyyy keeping it together and idk how I haven't just decided to say ""fuck it"" - why im posting this to reddit is beyond me,"
2344,Self harmed again. Feeling like a failure. I have no one,"Title pretty much sums it up. I struggle with PTSD and depression. I am taking this next semester of college off. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t even know where I’m gonna live after the holidays. I may be homeless. Fuck, I’m 18 and this is what my life has become. I don’t even know what I’m doing talking about this on the internet. I just need somebody to listen.  I’m not gonna kill myself, but I just want to stop everything and shut down. I’m so very tired of the pain."
2345,Waiting For The Day,"Um so hi people of reddit this is my first time posting and I just feel like I have no use to anybody or anything in this world.

So my school life is complete shit I have anxiety adhd combined and depression ofc and I always have the constant fact of wanting to end myself I don't know how I would do it its almost every time something bad happens or I fail I would just think about dieing and honestly the only thing holding me back from it all is the girl of my life my everything and we have been dating for 5 months and guess what her parents don't allow her to date and they just figured it out and ah ha im fucked and I just feel that if she leaves me because of her stupid overprotective parents that I'm legit going to end myself and I don't know what else I'm going to be living for because honestly I hate myself my body and my life I just want to die and I just cant change my mind I just wish that I could be with her and I have tried talking to people about it and I just cant and I'm done I cant take this shit world anymore and I just cant think about killing myself I feel that it would take too long to set everything up and then I would over think it and I just don't know what to do"
2346,I don’t know how to keep going,"I’m so tired. I have this rare disease that I have to prove to insurance that I have - even though they found my brain tumor. It’s killing me. Fucking literally. It’s been 18 months of wasting away my life and my body. 

I’m working odd jobs. I had such a life before. I could have really been something. I just wanted a chance at a career. I earned two degrees before I got sick. Now I’m 23 and my career is already over. 

I’m giving it until May. If they approve the surgery by May I won’t kill myself. But if not I’m done. I can’t stay waiting for my life to start until this disease kills me."
2347,I am considered suicide,"I wish I could have the courage to end my life, I don't want to go on, I'm tired of going on and I just want this to end"
2348,Going to the hospital because of suicidal thoughts,I wanna go to the hospital because of suicidal thoughts but I don’t want my family finding out my older brother would probably handle it well and be there for me should would my younger brother but he’s very easy to upset like me and I don’t want him to worry to much but the biggest problem is my Parents there borderline abuse and I don’t want to have to face them and I now they would blame each other and some sort of physical altercation would break out between them but I don’t know how much longer I can hold on like this without doing something bad I’m 19 btw tonight there was another fight in my house and it made me feel like everything is my fault and I just hate myself and I can’t stop crying.
2349,I’m tired of being so alone and not being good enough for anyone.,"I just want to know what it’s like to have someone else in your life.

I get so depressed seeing people find love with each other. One of my friends just had his crush say yes to him. I’m happy for him, but I’m bitterly depressed even more now because of it.

I just wish I could have that. I wish that I could know what that’s like.
It’s so hard when everyday I see people being so happy with each other.

If only I was someone else. Maybe then someone would be interested in me.
I just want to be loved. I don’t understand why I’m not good enough for that.

It’s so painful to see that not a single person I’ve tried to get closer with has any interest in me whatsoever. I’m such a failure. 

Even my dreams have become related to this now. Now I only ever dream that I find someone who cares about me.

I’m such a loser.
I want to believe that maybe in college I could meet someone, but that’s not going to happen.
I know it won’t.
Even if I did, I’m still me. And there isn’t anything about me that someone would like.
I’m ready to die.

I know I’m young and that this is dumb.
But I can’t take this. I can’t handle the fact that I’m not good enough for anyone. I can’t handle the fact that I’m a worthless waste of life. I’m so tired of this loneliness. I just want it to end."
2350,I don’t know how much longer I can wait,"I set the date for January 7th but this weekend looks like it might be perfect, you know? I have a pretty solid cocktail of drugs, booze, and pot ready to go. I just have to write all my notes. It’s just been a mess lately. I’m willing to do anything to distract myself but it doesn’t work - I constantly think about dying and how I have no future and it’s driving me mad. Lately I’ve literally just been searching out any drug or experience that will make me feel something else. I’m isolating myself by pissing off my friends and annoying them in our group chat. I don’t even want to go to work anymore - work was my solace and now I dread it every day. I’m ready to be dead and I’m ready to be done."
2351,I want out,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve had 20+ jobs since I was 18, I’m 26 now. I can’t hold onto a job long term. Rather it’s nasty co-workers. Crappy bosses, etc. I just started a new job and the one co-worker I work with directly is making my job unbearable for me. If I lose this job I will be financially distraught, I do not want to face this struggle. I won’t... what are some very successful ways to end your own life???? I am not trying to mess it up and end up becoming a vegetable the rest of my life... I’m sorry if I’m asking this but I’m not very confident I’ll be here much longer and I’m so sick and tired of this battle... I want to give up..."
2352,how to find help with getting euthanized?,"it's my life my choice, I'm not compatible with this society and I suffering every waking second of my life. All I want is for it to end so I can move on to the next life, thanks"
2353,No more tomorrows,"I’ve decided to end my life this Friday. I don’t want family to be home when I do it and Friday is my first chance. 

I wrote a poem called no more tomorrows on my phone. I’ve pasted it below. 


I have watched my final sunrise
No more tears through strained eyes
False hope abandoned for a day 
I shall never see 
No more sorrow, no more misery 

My family and friends may weep
For that I am sad
But a life full of few good and more bad 
Is truly no life to be had

The flame has dimmed
The price soon to be paid
No more struggle 
Through this mess I have made

No more tomorrows 
Not now not ever
Just know I’m on my way
To somewhere better"
2354,Sometimes I just feel like ending it,"I'm just sad in bed knowing that I'll never be able to stop negative self talking myself which stops me from doing anything. This is because I fear of constant rejection and embarrassment of being a useless, fat, lazy nobody who doesnt try to talk to anybody or girls in particular and fucks it up everytime I engage in convos in irl but online I feel like I'm hidden from the shame of messing up. Especially when people I do know and talk to from time to time, give me compliments or just say they love or care about me I just feel like, I'm not truly worth anything to them, and I'm just a burden for them to carry so they just say those things because they have to. Thinking about this almost everytime of day and especially at bed at night I feel like just ending it knowing probably, no will care or remember me or even know I did die because that's how little I actually matter to people around me. So maybe one day I'll do it, but maybe not because even killing myself seems like I'd even be more worthless after death."
2355,"I try so hard. I try hard so fucking hard to act like a normal person. I keep trying my best to filter myself and only say things that normal people would say, but I still get yelled at or laughed at by everyone for saying what I think is an innocent thing.",I have absolutely no idea what I am supposed to do from here. I'm not even myself. I have DPDR so I am so so so far away from myself I don't even know where I am located in my own body. Just hidden far far away in my own brain. Don't feel like typing anymore now just gonna zone out here.
2356,How do you do it?,"There are days I just can't hardly get out of my own way. How do you get through it? 

I've tried drugs, alcohol, sex, sleep more, exercise, therapy, family, friends, and still there's days I just want to drive over a cliff. I just can't stand myself sometimes and it's eating at me. What are some ways I can distract myself?"
2357,I self harmed,"At first it was a few light scratches, but then I made more cuts in my left wrist, and my mom found out...

I was feeling pretty bad, because of my family's health and college stuff, I felt that I wanted to puke and had waves of nausea, so I did that...

She had me swear that I would never do it again, and that I would start doing something to change all of this...

The thing is, I don't know if I have a future in the first place... Our family is quite ill, I have a great difficulty making friends, I'm confused and exhausted, I don't know what to do..."
2358,A friend of mine is suicidal.,"She’s a Freshmen. I met her through a school club, and she’s been suicidal. She’s cut herself in the past, although not recently. However, with her boyfriend, things have not been going well. He’s been distant, refuses to communicate, and just doesn’t seem to care.

The day they got together was the day that she planned to kill herself. But she stopped... he stopped her. And now, their relationship is falling apart. What’s more, is she only sees her boyfriend face to face twice in a week, and even then they aren’t alone.

She’s dug herself into a ditch, and it’s not going well for her. She’s tethered herself to a person who can’t even return the love and affection any relationship calls for.

How do I convince her to keep going?"
2359,When the one person you want to be there for you just isn’t..,It really sucks. When I am trying to open up too. That is so hard. And they’re just.. absent. It’s awful. It makes me wonder what I did wrong. But I think I can see that it’s not my fault actually. I just don’t know what to do..
2360,"I'm out of answers, out of people to turn to, I'm out of hope","I just dont know what to do. I hate waking up. I hate existing. My family says there always here for me but they never reach out. They don't actually care, anytime I talk to them they just tell me to look at things differently, FUCK off. My dad died recently and he was the only one who understood me. I just wanna go be with him, no one appreciates me in this world. Theres not nearly enough good in this world to justify all of the bullshit. I'm fucking addicted to kratom, weed, nicotine. SSRIs have failed me, therapists have failed me (how the hell is 1 hour every 2 weeks going to help anyone?) I dont want to hurt myself but I cant stand the hurt that happens just existing. I'm at the end of my rope and no one takes it seriously, so maybe I should show them how serious I am"
2361,"If my Psychiatrist won't send me to a Mental Hospital, I'm going to fucking attempt another Suicide for the 6th time.",
2362,I don't wanna bother anyone,"I don't wanna bother anyone with how I feel. How numb I am right now. I don't wanna do it yet, I wanna finish my finals, see if I can pull through my schooling, maybe I'll feel better about myself a bit and open up. Maybe I can prove to myself that I can be worth something. Even if it's not today or tomorrow, just be and feel worth something at some point. But I don't wanna be here. I wanna be selfish and do something for myself. I want to relieve  myself of this pain and guilt and worthless feeling. I want to relieve everyone of the burden that doesn't just come in my wake, but showing itself long before I arrive. I wish I could tell my boyfriend but he's working on a project for his hobby. I wish I could tell my best friend but she died years ago. I'd talk to my baby but I don't want him to hear how his mama wants to die. How she doesn't think she can be there while he grows up.

Not even 2 months and he's already gotten so big. His smiles and cooing make everyone happy. His life can replace mine."
2363,I dont have anyone i can talk to about this,"I have been feeling suicidal, and i cant tell anyone about it, me and my friends have joked bout it before once or twice but we dont take things too seriously. My brother doesnt talk to me anymore because we had a fight. I dont want to tell my parents because it would stress them out. I put my gun to my head almost every day but i dont pull the trigger because i dont want my parents to have to deal with my death. Some days i have a lot of fun at work, and with my friends, but when i come home im all alone. it feels like i have no reason to live. ive been drinking heavily about 2 to 3 times a week to mask my feelings. It feels painful to keep living, but i dont want my mom to see me dead, because she has depression too, and im afraid she might hurt her self. Im afraid if i call the hotline they will put me in jail or a hospital, and i might loose my job. I just wanted to tell this to someone so im putting it out there. thank you for listening"
2364,Why should I live in a world where I can't trust anybody? Better yet why should I have to spend it trapped in the worst fucking body ever?,Everyone has lied to me and betrayed my trust atleast once. I'm so fucking alone but I dont know if it's better than knowing the monsters that are humans. My mom getting the therapy session was my last hope then she cancelled it. And now I have to be in this body forever. It proves I'm a fucking fag boy. She let my father and her boyfriend abuse me and told me it never happened. And she ruined me and made me a mean ugly person whose angry all the time. But the only real reason I'm doing this is that she left me to be stuck in this body and laughed at me. She'll never get me any help. My only resource is to kill myself and I'll have to do it in a male body.
2366,I don’t want death .. I still have a mission to carry out but it seems hopeless,"

Tl;DR emotional abusive life makes me want to quit but I can’t 


After my breakup with my boyfriend... I wanted to break down and cry I did a little bit I held it in and moved on .....went to join a club full of Star Wars and nerf nerds like me to distract myself from the hell of my life ... I distant myself from anything relating to my ex and even when he dm Ed me back wanting to chat I was ok and wanted to chat forgetting what happened .... I was fine .. I still am fine ... I want to break down and cry right now but I’m still fine ... my father will yell at me for trying to buy the family gifts with my money cause he holds all my money and cards ( I’m 20 )  my autistic brother is becoming more and more emotional and hitting things due to the SHIT. High school he’s in ( that I went to and suffered in)   And mom is tired of my dad and getting tired of me actin like my dad ... everyone is tired of everything...so I turn back to my title ..

I still got a mission.. what is it ? 
Protect my family and mainly brother. 
I don’t want to ever give up that mission .. I’ll never give up ...
Does it mean I won’t be happy with any boy I ever fancy ? Yeah ...
Will I have to dedicate a chunk of my life to my bother and home ... yeah ... 
am I ok with it ? .. yeah 

If being brought onto this earth because papa like a Brazilian looking model then I guess I’m just the disabled child who came out the hot wife then ( I’ve also got adhd and I’m blind partly ) 


I still am fine ... 
there are people suffering worse then me ... 
so that adds to my fire ... to actually complete my mission... so why don’t I kill my self ? Besides my fear of being forgotten.... I don’t want to fail my mission .



But the mission is looking more and more impossible everyday and sometimes ... just siting alone outdoors in the cold..... reminds me ... hey @anthonybynum11 remember... you got a mission to complete 



  if your down here.. why ? Why did you read it ?  People normally just pass me by... everyone even family does so why did ya stay ? I’m grateful tho if you did . Wish I could give ya something for ya trouble"

2377,I feel like feminism wants me to kill myself.,"I know how inflammatory the title is. But it’s just a feeling I can’t shake. While I do believe that the current wave of feminism is overdue and positive, there are some who take it a bit too far. 

It doesn’t take much to fall down a google rabbit-hole of radical feminists and #yesallmen, male obsoletism rhetoric, etc. There are also prominent feminist bloggers who blatantly say they don’t care about male suicide, and that men shouldn’t exist anyway. Mix this with the vitriol against all men in general, and it’s like they stop just short of urging us to kill ourselves because that’s what they want. 

While I want to believe that this abhorrent toxicity is part of the fringe, I can’t help but feel it is what a lot of women think, even if just subconsciously.  The double standard needs to stop. If I displayed the same behaviour toward women that they do toward men, it would be social suicide. Tipping the scales all the way from one side to the other isn’t equality. 

It almost feels like a bit of a betrayal; ever since I was a young kid I always found gender stereotypes/picking on girls to be in absolute poor taste. Always stood up for them and made my distaste for sexist behaviour very clear. Of course half the population is just as competent as the other. That’s just logical, right? I definitely think so."

2379,So hurt I don't even know who I am anymore,Had another panic attack. Still dizzy from it. How can people be so heartless. How can people stab you in the back so many times and act like it's your fault. How can I keep falling for it and keep this toxicity in my life. Fuck I cant get away from it. And now I'm stuck in my mind just constantly thinking of different ways I can die. What's worst is seeing my family trying to cope with me being a now 20 year old depressed piece of shit. I fucking hate her for doing this to me. Someone please end my miserable life.
2380,In an impossible position,"So here's my story. 

I had extramarital affairs with a few women i worked with a few years ago. None of them reported to me in any capacity. Nothing impacted the workplace. We were in neighboring departments that didnt depend on each other, just were in the same geographic location. 

One of the husbands found out, understandably freaked out and threatened me. Instantly cut all ties. 

Things seemed to stabilize. They transfered to another department, i stayed where i was. There was zero contact besides an occasional text from them threatening me. 

Out of the blue, i get a request to meet woth HR tomorrow. If this is about what i think it is, and it causes me to lose my job and admit my indiscretions to my wife, i will not only lose my job but lose my family. I will then have nothing to live for. 

I will drive home, take out my Glock 19 and end my life. I cant imagine living without my family. 

I know some or many of you will say you should have thought of that before you messed around. YOU ARE RIGHT. I SHOULD HAVE. But i didnt."
2381,"I can be temporarily happy, but my emotional baseline always tells me suicidal is inevitable.","Since I was about 12, I never saw myself living past 29 (since at that age people thought 30 was old), and if something didn’t kill me, I knew I’d kill myself at some point. I’ve never felt like it mattered in the grand scheme of things, and my self-worth is non existent. I’m 23 now, and I feel the same way. I can feel love for someone, I can enjoy a moment, or I can anticipate something that’s coming up, but those moments aren’t all the time. I usually take care of the people in my life rather than myself, just in case you get scored for the kind of person you were in the afterlife. Being selfish is the quickest way to lose points.

I’ve lived a “keep your chin up and keep pushing” lifestyle. I’ve spent most of my time being a workaholic and keeping busy so thoughts can’t keep up with me, but they always do.

I left my job in July. I do “shameful” work in order to make any money. I’m engaged, and I love my fiancée very much, but I feel selfish knowing that what I’d love is happiness with her for the rest of my life, but I also can’t get shake the feeling of wanting to just disappear any day now, which I’d warmly welcome. I feel like I should leave her to spare her. I thought if I found someone I wanted to spend my life with forever, that I’d actually want to continue to be here. Instead, I still want to cut connections with people I have, not create new ones or maintain them. I have no motivation to get another job, to clean, to take care of myself, or to even hurt myself in a suicide attempt. I don’t have any strength left. It’s all exhausting and I want to lay here and wither away. It’s been long time of dealing with this, and I’m so drained. And I have no means to afford help with only $1 in my account and no drive to earn more so I can buy medication I was supposed to start that’s been sitting at the pharmacy for weeks. And why ask someone for help when I’ll just end up back here anyway?

If not today, then some day eventually. I’ve got less than 6 years left, maybe only 6 days if I completely stop eating too.

2385,"This is going to sound messed up, but I’m just so frustrated that I want to just let this off my chest.","I’m so jealous of other people’s death. Why is that sometimes it’s always the people who want to live longer and want to enjoy their life are the ones dying first and at such an early age while I’m over here wishing every night to die? Why take their lives like just fuckin’ take mine? If it was possible, i would donate my own life to someone that matters more in a heartbeat. It pisses me off and I’m jealous."
2386,would i die if i drank laundry detergent?,"lately ive been having suicidal thoughts every waking moment and it’s just too much. i want to kill myself. but i don’t know if i’m going to regret it. the only think keeping me from doing it is the fear that i’ll go to hell and only suffer more for the rest of eternity, because i’d like to say i’m a religious person but my relationship with god is honestly not good at all. i believe in him, but i dont have a relationship with him, which is the problem here. i wish i could die and all my problems would go away, but death ultimately means hell for me because of my sinful actions, and i don’t have the motivation to change my ways. i’m aware im a horrible sinner and i don’t do anything to fix it, which makes it worse.  
anyways, i have no reason to be sad. i’m middle class, i go to a private school, and all of my needs are met, along with various wants that only gave me a small amount of happiness, only to later be a reminder of how shitty i am. i have 2 guitars and a bass guitar, and i used to be okay at them, but now i feel so horrible because i never play them and i feel so guilty about everything all the time. im failing my easiest class right now and i have so much work due by monday, which is the end of the semester, i don’t know what to do with myself. even tomorrow i’m supposed to have 1,100$ for a mission trip i’m going on, and i only have $200. i wish everything could just stop. i realize people would miss me but the feelings i’m having right now are too much to bear, and the consequences of these feelings (the laziness, the bad hygiene, the asocial tendencies, etc) are only making everything 10x worse. 
im sorry for all the tangents. basically, i want to die so fucking bad it’s the only thing i can think about. but i’m scared of dying because i’m scared of the unknown. so, if i drink laundry detergent, then run upstairs a few minutes after and tell my parents so they can bring me to the ER, will i die? if i do that i’ll probably stop thinking about it, since all i can think about for the past 5 months is to kill myself, and this month’s method of choice has been poison. and then, i’ll be admitted to the psych ward, and i’ll get better and i’ll be able to finally function normally. i’m tired of having fantasies of my own funeral, how people would react, what my note would be, etc. 
i mean i’ve even been suicidal since the age of 8 due to childhood trauma. i just want this all to end. im tired of hurting. im only 16 years old and i haven’t even felt real love yet"

Every day is too stressful and I just can’t do it anymore. I’ve been feeling more and more tired and I’m fucking sick of it. I’m just ready to die. 

I plan on killing myself the first Monday of Christmas break. Everything is just getting too exhausting and I can’t handle it anymore.

2393,The Hardest Part,"Just another rant post.

I've come to realize that the hardest part of killing myself is getting everything in order before I do, so that my partner and family have the easiest time possible while going through it.

I never really thought about any of this as a teen. Sure, there were a few things that needed fixed or perfected beforehand, but not nearly as much now that I'm an adult. Especially when it comes to finances.

I want to make sure I've got at least half of the cost covered before I die, easily accessible to my partner and family, which is a little harder than it sounds. Other than that, I've downloaded a ""What To Do When Someone Unexpectedly Dies"" walkthrough that will be emailed or printed (I haven't decided yet) for everyone, to hopefully help make all the legal/money/account stuff easier to track. I'm also making sure there are no outstanding debts/loans/etc, creating somewhat of a will, and very much cutting down on any and all material possessions so that they will be easier to go through for everyone.

Still, I can't help but have this nagging thought in the back of my head that I am missing *at least* one *very* important component and it's driving me fucking mad."
2394,This world it's shit,"I'm aware thats there's a lot of good things but im equally aware thats there a lot of shitty things in this world, i can't live with it, I'm way to sensitive to others suffering that it makes me suffer, and the only solution to this is to ""focus on the good"", ""distract yourself"", basically be ignorant. And i fucking hate it, the only times I'm happy is when i only think about myself but I get depressed as soon as i think even slightly about others.


My brother for example, we were shopping for clothes and we saw some makeup, he immediately got dawn to it, (but i know the only reason he got close to it was because i was around). 
He tried some on but ""as a joke"" because ""obviously what guy is serious about makup"" 
He then started making fun of gay people, he dug himself a gave, limiting himself even though he doesn't want to just because of society...

This hurts me so much, someone I've grown up with is to scared about wanting something just because of social norms and the only way he can get close to it is to joke about it...
F me"
2395,Christmas Night I am ending my life. I can't take it anymore and I can't do it anymore.,"I don't know what to do anymore.

I am on SSI and for the past ten years I have been renting a bedroom from my aunt. she lives in low income and gave me two options ten years ago when I asked if I could stay with her. Option 1 put my income down and give her my entire check or option 2, don't put my income down on the lease and pay her only 320 a month. I went with option two and signed the lease no income and have been doing that the past ten years only to learn as of last week it was a crime and I could face prison time for ten years or be sued for 20 thousand or more.

She takes my 200 in food stamps and buys food which I barely get any of each month for example tonight she fixed fish sticks for dinner and she took about 15 of them, her 34 yr old son who has no income took 30 of them leaving about 10 left then bitches at me because I said I didn't want them because there wasn't enough.

When I buy food out of my check each month she eats the food. or she complains and bitches until I share it. She drags me into debt each month telling me to over draft my account to pay her bills she lacks from her disability check then when I don't she raises hell about it and black mails me telling me shes going to kick me out if I don't.

The car she has was supposed to be mine. it is my dads and when he was on his death bed she had him sign papers saying it was hospital bills etc but it was a will leaving her the car. the car is now run down, been in 5 accidents and torn to hell and back and is falling apart and she is talking about scrapping it for junk instead of giving it to me to try to fix up.

In the mean time she takes the 320 I give her each month for rent and puts it towards a brand new car she makes payments on for her son whos 34, no income, doesn't know how to cook or do anything for himself but yet he was int he national guard been to college and graduated high school. Yet he doesn't know how to cook, or do laundry and refuses to find a job and lives off his mom and me.

I spent 3 years trying to save money to get a car when I bought one from the car dealership It turned out to have a small leak in the engine block from a small crack the dealership fixed temporarily and hid. the car was too old for lemon law and to get the money back on.

I spent ten years homeless and at deaths door when I moved in here with her and past ten years I been trying to get on my feet. get a vehicle to live in while I find my own low income apartment and tried for ten years to get my GED but found out I have learning issues that keep me from getting it.

I spent the past ten years trying to get a job no one will hire me, I spent the past ten years trying to find a room to rent I can afford. 450 a month or close to it with all utilities included. I can't afford more then that plus the bills I have ontop of that with my $790 a month usd disability check.

I can't take anymore I literally can't do it anymore. I am turning 39 in january and just can't live another year with these two pieces of shit. I can't survive homelessness anymore because I have arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there are days I can barely get out of bed. no way I can be on the streets without a vehicle at this point.

If I apply for low income apartments, they will contact these apartments and the manager here will then find out I have income and then I will be arrested, thrown in prison for ten years or sued for 20 thousand or more or both. I just dunno what to do anymore. I just know I can't keep living here anymore."
2396,I would want to week help but I don't know how,"So basically since 2017 I've been considering suicide but lately I think I've begun to overcome it and I want to talk about it with a psychologist.

2400,"Well the problem is me, but I can't finish it.","23 yo male, 350 of fat, live with my dad, no luck finding a job. A year ago I went into a huge fan rush, I worked at a call center that sucked me dry, I lived on my own in my cousin's house where I put half of the money to buy bc I thought I wanted it but never signed anything. She eventually convinced me to move back with my dad bc I had turned into an asshole and I was toxic and depressing. I came to the realization that I don't matter. And that no one really needs me. So I tried to hang myself but I was too chicken shit to go through with it. So I spent all my money on food. Got up to the point that a heart attack was pretty much guarenteed. Then I got into a fight with my cousin and my dad wanted me back, ""to be closer as I am his only son"" and my sister was reckless. 

Now I'm a dissapointment everywhere I go. I'm causing issues and I'm breaking everything. Right now I want to just cut my hands open and bleed to death. I don't want this anymore. I was a good kid, man.  I was smart. I used to make music. I was getting better man. Somewhere along the way I stopped caring. U ntil now, I'm too much of a bitch to even end myself. I provide nothing but problems and it doesn't matter if things get better, my depression comes back and ruins me.

Then I got a little more adventurous with nooses which are easy as hell to tie and a neat trick to know but your body puts up a hell of a fight when you're dying, don't recommend this to anyone.

Now I really want to just feel all the pain and see something worthy of me losing every experience and memory I have ever had or ever could have. Like slitting wrists or something. 

Dying in my sleep or suddenly seems like it'd almost be a waste. Maybe I'm just being dramatic, so many people die why not just accept a simple death."

2406,"My final week on Earth, and I've already wasted half of it.","I intend to be dead by Sunday night. I've made sure of it. I've travelled hundreds of miles to a destination that truly meant something to me when I was younger. I've just about spent the last of my savings on this trip and the hotel and rental car, so there is no turning back from this point. 

I could have also met some friends here that I left behind when I moved. I could have visited the campus of the school I graduated from, or spoken to an old employer that I left on very good terms with. But depression is a real bitch. I am here in my hotel room, barely even able to summon the energy to crawl out of bed. My entire body hurts. Even when I am awake, I feel completely unable to do anything but sit in front of my laptop and read fanfiction.

 I intend to drive up to the wilderness so that my death will not cause a gory mess for the hotel staff to deal with. However, my paranoia tells me that if I attempt that, that I will end up being caught by some park ranger or cop on the way there, that my plans will be foiled and that I will be committed and then sent a $100,000 bill for ""psychiatric care."" There is a voice in my head that tells me that it would just be easier to do the deed here in the hotel room and add to the list of people my existence has inconvenienced.

Maybe there is still that uncertainty. There is no going back after the deed is done. I do not know how my parents, who I have a somewhat strained relationship with, will react. I do not know how my peers, some of whom looked up to me in the past, will react. And even though there is zero scientific proof of any afterlife or diet, I still cannot shake the idea of an angry god ready to torment me for the imperfect, selfish life I've lived.

But where can I go back to? Like I said, I've already spent most of my savings making this final trip. I'm not sure I'd even have enough left for a ticket back home. And even if I did, rent is due soon. My parents have helped me financially in the past, but they are still under the impression that I am still a correctional officer who is able to pay his own bills now, and I don't have the heart to break it to them that I quit. And besides, their paitence with me has recently been very low. I was homeless for two days a couple of years ago, and it was a shirty experience even in late summer. Now it is winter. 

My life is ending. And there seems to be no way out of this death spiral."

Maybe it is because I am like my dad, and my mum used to badmouth him  a lot when I was younger, portraiting him in my head like satan himself. When I was younger I was so different, so full of joy.. But I cannot feel much besides Pain and the adrenaline Rush I get by doing crazy things (climbing on cranes etc.), but I dont want to ruin the communitys image because 98% are life loving people.   
I am 22 now and studying, something I semi enjoy but the environment is meh..   
My BELOVED Grandma died this year, I was the one finding the body.. she has been weakend by Lung cancer and depression (my grandpa died 2 years ago, they were married for 52 years, ruhuna fatiha). On top of all that.. I missed out the last 48 hours of my grandmas life because I was selfish and got drunk with my friends instead of coming home and caring for her. I remember coming home, going to her bed, and hearing and breath weakly.. she mustve died 20 min after I came home, I feel SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MMUUUUUUCH GUILT.. Maybe if I had been sober and cared for her those days she would still be alive... she is the best human being that has lived, she was always there for me even if my parents weren't.   
I told my dad this year that I am suicidal. He said he would be driving to my place and we will find a solution. (I live 3 1/2 hours away from him) he called me 3 hours later that he is not coming, and that it is unfair of me to tell him that over the phone, but that day i stood in front of the Train trails and was realy fcking close to jump, but my grandma was still alive and I didnt want her to experience this alive. So I opted not too and call my dad to get turned down once again. (SIDE NOTE: He is a psychologist/ works nowadays in Psychology of Economics)   
He says I am selfish etc.. It is an act against family blah blah blah when in reality he cares and does more for my stepsiblings and thinks Higher of them and I feel like he is ashamed of me sometimes/ I am a Mistake..   
My Mom on the other hand is always super controlling and wants to get involved in almost everything + has INSANE mood swings... My Gf also knows and is the only one believing in me, always trying to get my mood up. But thats too much of a burden.. + its a LDR so we dont get too see each other often.   
I used to get myself through this shit by excessive drinking and partying, I can fortunately say that Women have found me quite attractive in the recent years although I think I look like a hairy monkey which led to some get arounds.. but I dont do this anymore because I dont wanna cheat on my gf. I have cheated in a past relationship, still feel guilty and learned my lesson from it to whatever the setup is I wont cheat ever again.. I feel like wasting so much time in my life + fighting to get out of bed sometimes... + I am usually super Extraverted and outgoing but even if I appear to have some charisma like a lion there passes no day by where I wont think about cutting my wrists or laying myself on the train tracks... Some of my friends know about this like 3 or so.. I have multiple social circles but feel so disgusted by myself at times.. Now my grandparents are dead, which was the main reason I stayed alive to this day, but now they are gone and I feel like my last safety net is gone now.. I'm thinking about making a crappy break-up with my gf so she wont care for me anymore and it wont hurt her so much when I will finally do it. What can I say, I am a wreck, and tired of this bs.   
This is only the surface and I am done..........   


  
Sorry for bad typo/grammar I am a foreigner"
2408,I can’t do it anymore. I want death.,"I lie in bed hoping to die all day. I’ve lost all control over my life. There is no point to anything. I wanted to finish law school. I can’t anymore and now I just want to plan out my death. There are too many barriers. It’s officially impossible. I have bupropion that could kill me if I take them all at once. I think I will. Maybe with some vodka. I just have nothing to be happy about, nothing to look forward to. I want to be dead. I have a good job but I spend most of my time in bed. I tell my boss everyday that I’m too depressed. He’s very understanding. I just started working there and know I have to begin to pull my weight. But without law school what’s the point of anything? I just want to fucking kill myself. Nothing fucking matters. Nothing. We were all put here for no reason. We live, we suffer, we die. Some are lucky and die before they spend a lifetime suffering. I want death so bad. When I’m in the car I pray to get into a car accident. I stay up all night on reddit doing stupid shit, then sleep all day and can’t work. I hate sunrise. It’s crushing to look out the window and accept that you will not meet any of the day’s aspirations. I fucking hate everything. The only way to have peace is if I’m dead. 
I want to say goodbye to my family. I want them to know that the cia did this to me. I can’t write them a note. I hope they find this one day."
2409,I’ve been non stop suicidal for weeks. I’m so exhausted I hate this existence.,"Currently chugging weed and booze and crying and fucking hating myself. I just want to hide in bed and never have to get out. Why isn’t giving up an option? I want to so, so badly. 
Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckeverything. 
I hate myself."
2410,I want to fall asleep and never wake up,"I wake up every morning just wanting to do, I feel like I'm getting pretty close to doing it but just want to wait till after Christmas so I don't ruin it.

Every time I want to say how I feel or talk about it I feel like I'm being selfish or that I'm not aloud to feel like this because I'm not ""truly Suicidal"" but I sont even know what that means I jsut know that I want to be dead, I want to buy paracetamol and just die.

I hate myself so much and I bet everyone else does too I threw parties a few weeks ago and around 20 people told me that they were coming and more than that replied on Facebook, 5 came to the first 1 to the second. And no one says anything.

I felt crap before that but feel worse after. I've always viewed my family as perfect but hene I told them that I was struggling my parents told me to man up and that I was just being selfish.

SELFISH! I wake up everyday and think about how the world would be so much better if I wasn't her but because I didn't pick up my phone when you called I ruined your whole day.

My Mom told me that she is finding it difficult with my younger siblings so doesn't need any of my crap, and says that she had a bad day when I didn't call her back when I was busy.

My parents pretend to be supportive but all they do is blame me for why i feel like dying and tell me that the reason their day was bad was my fault!

I wanna die so bad, I feel at times that I might like being more feminine, wearing lipstick or painting my nails, but all I hear in my head when I think about it is my mother screaming at me when I was young for putting on nail polish for ""not acting like a man"" and saying that I was ""too emotional"", she is left wing but often calls trans peopel mental, or when I had friends and 2 were LGBTQ+ my Mam told me there heads must be fucked or that they must have shitty parents, but their families were fine and the more I think about it the more I think that Mines the shitty one.

But blaming my low mood, Suicidal thoughts and feelings of worthlessness would be shitty. 

If I'm gonna kill myself it's cause I wanted too not cause my mom said that I wouldn't amount to anything 

I just wish I could fall asleep and it would end it all

I want to go to the bridge 5 minutes away take some pills and just jump


Fuck I meant to jayt post that I'd been feeling Suicidal and down not a fucking page of my shit and shitty feelings sorry for wasting your time if you read this but honestly

TL:DR - I'm a piece of shit, slef loathing, self isolating, self sabotaging, self harming piece of crap who is too scared and too much of a pussy to even kill myself and I can't even do it when I'm so close to being free from all of this. Don't bother reading this I'm not worth it"
2411,..why did this all break me into dust..?,"Fuck, enough, enough, enough, I already had fucking enough.
 I ruined my life a year ago, somehow destroyed a relationship that seemed indestructible.  I fucked up, fucked up my only chance of happiness.
 It's too late now, too late to fix anything.  I mean nothing to her.  My death would mean nothing to her but I had to fucking bend and make that fucking promise.  2 years, 2 fucking years.  My love for her forced me to make this promise.
 Why couldn't I fix it all?  Why am I a fucking failure again?
 I have no chance for happiness anymore.  Even if she knew how much I still love her, if she knew how she gave me the best moments of my life, She would still not care about me, she would still look at me like rubbish that breaks down on the street.
 I'm fed up, I'm not planning suicide tonight, but if it happens, if I just bleed out, it means that fate wanted it, it means that it must happen, it means it will improve her life."
2412,Being alive is fucking painful. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.,Post history for context
2413,I hate this world,"Everyone is up against me and feel stuck. People say it’s gonna get better but it doesn’t. I’m in my bathroom rn crying, I don’t want my parents to yell at me about my driving lesson. I just wanna crawl out the window and run into the forest where I can enjoy nature. High school is killing me along with all the responsibilities. I just want to be a kid again but that’s not gonna happen but I’m crying like one. I don’t fucking know why I’m even writing this"
2414,I cried about how relieving it would be to just pass away peacefully,"I’m hurting so bad. I can’t afford mental health care. I’m a loser, no job, barely finishing second semester of college. There’s much more to why I’m feeling like this but I’m too tired to type all of it out. I have no idea what my future looks like because I have no passions or aspirations. I’ve got nothing going for me and I contribute nothing to society. Today I sobbed tears of relief about how amazing it would be just to fade out of existence. No more hurting, no more anything. If there is a god I’m going to find out."
2415,My best friend 22M just told me to never talk to him again,After he told me about his suicide plans he proceeded to tell me that he doesnt want me in his life anymore and it would be easier to cut me off now. I dont know what to do or who to talk with. What can i do for him please. Do i call his therapist/psychiatrist tomorrow? Do i call his parents?  Please anything any advice is appreciated i dont want to leave him like this
2416,The more I try the more I hurt,"I think I've figured out that through periods of intense loneliness I can achieve some base state of sad wherein I can still get shit done (don't think this is common). I have felt that slow down as time goes on, but that's not what's interesting.

The more I do try and socialize within those periods of isolation the more awful it feels when I find myself alone. It really makes me want to give up. It's like those dumbass liquid things where you hit them and they resist more, y'all know what I'm talking about. The more effort that goes in to making friends that may stick the more it stings when alone. It's like yeah, you tried, and we've looked at what you brought to the table.... nope we also don't give a fuck about you.

I would rather just ride the rest of life out without a single bit of socializing, at least then I'd be sure to die when nobody would mind. I'm nearly there anyways, may just try again and feel the relief."
2417,32 year old man wants to die in the Amazon:D,"Hello everyone, my name is Sean, and I am a drug-addicted alcoholic, compulsive liar, cheater, shitty friend, even worse son, brother, blah blah blah.. anyway, I've had enough of life, from constantly hurting others, to not being able to get my head straight, to constantly replaying my past, over and over again. I'm a fucked up individual to say the least, but in all honesty, I've tried everything (yah bitch, I mean everything) from yoga, to meditation, exercise, self-help groups, volunteering, I even tried to find God! But like my life story, it has all failed.. I just uprooted my life to Colombia, because well fuck it why not?! I was giving this life thing one last shot with this beautiful girl I met, who is better than me in every way possible and deserves so much more.. so I don't know what to do. Since I've been a disaster emotionally ever since I got here! Today she gave me the ultimatum, either be happy or that's it. And I'm like fuck, my whole life I've been trying to be happy, sober and be able to deal with life appropriately, and you want me to be good from today on??? Anyway, I'm gonna head to the Amazon soon since I'm a day away from fucking up another relationship because I can't keep my shit together. My dream before I die is to see the Amazon, and to fish on the Amazon river. So while I'm there, are there any plants or something I could eat? Was thinking of jumping into the river, get eaten by piranhas or whatever else is in there, but that's not a forsure way to go.. so the point is is that I've had enough hurting people, and I want to die where I actually want to be in life."
2418,i was supposed to kill myself almost a month ago and i really want to do it but i don't want to hurt people that are close to me. I feel like a b word because im to scared to kill myself.,
2419,2020 is coming and i'm going down the hill," so 2020 is about to come, i'm a millennial born in the 2000, for some reason i think it will go down hill from now on, and these thoughts are making me afraid, haven't made any progress in life, im 19 dont know how to drive, dropped out of school due to social anxiety, and all i do is play video games all day taking pills lying to myself that everything will be ok, it will not be ok, i'm gonna say this tho, as long as my mom lives i live, when she is gone im going with her, i will die in my 20's, idk why, i just feel it."
2420,When is it alright to let go?,"Its been a very rough year with several major events. I got re-traumatized a few months ago, i lost 2 family members, i had to get surgery due to an infection, i ended up in a shitty job which took a big toll on me and some other bad things. I'm so tired, i just want to go so i can have peace. I am in therapy, i get meds and nothing works. If i had a gun i would probably blow my head off right now, but I'm not living in a country with that easily access to guns."
2421,It often feels like I'm meant to have killed myself a long time ago and I'm pushing off the inevitable.,"Same story everyone else here has.  Depression for as long as I can remember.  Things would go good in my life, then go bad, then be okay and no matter where I was emotionally through these ups and downs, I've wanted to kill myself.  I had always sort of mocked or belittled the concept of suicide to myself to keep myself from doing it, if that makes sense.  

I've been going through some particularly tough times recently, worse than I've had in a long time.  Practically homeless right now.  Luckily my ex has been kind enough to let me stay with her while I figure shit out.  We have a kid, so I get to be there for my little girl while her mom works.  But I have to leave.  I've been here too long now.  I had a shit job that let me help out, but I lost it in November so now I'm just here.  I've wanted to leave a while ago, the ex convinced me that it helps all three of us, but now I'm just here and we both want me gone.  I have nowhere, but I'm going after the holidays.  

I've been applying all year to get a job while I had that shit job.  Nothing.  I've gone to interviews, I've filled out applications to anywhere you can think of.  I filled out an application to Trader Joe's before Thanksgiving, and I've been doing this thing where I call the store back after some time.  When I did with the, they told me to come back in and fill out another application so I decided I would sort of be assertive and see if I could get an interview with the person I spoke to.  Dude wasn't there, and I got the same story about waiting a while to hear from them, even though I had already waited.  I needed that job.  You have no idea how much I needed that job.

I had a friend I was messing around with a while ago who had a miscarriage.  That was hard.  I mean, I'm not in a place I can take care of another kid financially, but shit.  I went through all the mental hoops.  She called me scared when she first realized she was late and we talked it out.  I was scared myself, but I accepted it mentally.  Started to see the good stuff, then some time later we went to her doctor cause she had some bleeding.  She lost it.  I know as a guy I'm not supposed to feel like this.  I know I'm supposed to be sort of relieved cause I have no job, but it feels like I lost something important.  

Now I'm on the verge of homelessness, I have no job, I have no girlfriend, and the worse of it is that I'm going to be away from my daughter.  Not like the ex is keeping me from her, and in fact is letting me spend as much time as I want with her.  But, if you're a parent, you know.  There is never enough time.  I want to be there for her all the time.  Being away from her is heart wrenching.  It's going to be the trigger.  I know I'm supposed to be here for her, I know I'm supposed to try and be strong, but fuck man.  I've been strong my whole life.  I'm tires of fighting."
2422,"Counselors can't help me, the threat of hospitalization is too big",I can't fucking open up to them about my self harm or suicidal thoughts or else I'll get taken away and hospitalized. How is that fair? How can they expect us to be open and honest with our feelings with this looming threat hanging over our heads?
2423,"Trying to find some direction, but still feeling trapped.","(This post is gonna be kind of a mess since I'm going pretty back and forth with it adding and changing parts as I go along. Sorry if it makes no sense.) 

I had a long talk with my mum this evening, during which I almost told her that I'm suicidal. I kind of wanted to, she has always been supportive and has known where to look to get help, if she was unable to help by herself.

I did manage to tell her about the breakdown I had at work over the summer, and how things have gotten worse since I lost two huge sources of support in my life (my girlfriend and therapy). I did tell her that I've been having some pretty dark thoughts but couldn't help but shy away from the extent of those thoughts.

I've been researching for weeks how to do it quickly and with as little discomfort as possible, and ways to increase my chances of success. I want her to know and I think I need her to know, but I'm scared. All the while I'm thinking about this, I'm still worrying about work. I put so much pressure on myself because my workplace is short-staffed as it is and I feel guilty about putting my coworkers in a more difficult situation.  I saw a doctor today who offered to sign me off for a few weeks to get myself back in therapy and to give my new meds a chance to get into my system and hopefully alleviate some of the side effects, which I declined in favour of a note saying to reduce my hours instead of taking me off entirely.

I just really don't know what to do, where to go from here. I'm trying to make a start on recovery but it's so difficult and I'm a little afraid of the fact that somewhere in the back of my mind, I know I have another option. No less difficult, but faster and guarantees that I'll never hurt like this again."
2424,I hate having aspergers,"I hate being different, I hate being misunderstood, I hate being considered ""non-human"" because I don't have the best social skills, I just want my tragic life to end, I'm sorry I was born with a form of autism, I didn't choose it, but I'll solve it if I can kill myself sometime next year, I hate feeling like a monster for having a defect."
2425,"All I do as fail at life, I’m just tired of it.",
2426,cant stop these thoughts all the time,"Hi to whoever's reading this,

I dont know what to do anymore. Ive been struggling with depression and bad ocd since 2015/16 now, and yes i improved and almost beat the ocd but i cant help but still want to end my life. The depression and aniexty are attached to a childhood trauma that im still learning to progress but its so incredibly hard to stay motivated.

The depression always comes back to me, and lately i haven't been able to go to school anymore due aniexty attacks and the thoughts that no one likes me. I really don't know what to do anymore. The fact that my sister has been telling me what im ruining my future by not being able to get myself to get a job, due the aniexty attacks, makes me feel like I've pretty much already ruined my whole life.

Im still in therapy, i have been since end 2016 but i just feel so hopeless. The sessions dont seem to work. Im not allowed to get medication; since last time i tried them i turned into a completely different person (hurting myself in public without realizing, panic attacks, pupils full blown, blood getting thinner etc.)

I seriously dont know what to do. I don't want to live with these depressive feelings always coming back to me. I hate myself for it and i feel like a terrible person. I dont know how to keep up.
I cant keep stable relationships with friends because sometimes i just need some time alone, which always ends up in me falling back into a depressive spiral; 

Is there really something left for me to live for? Im turning 17 next month. Yes, im curious about what the future holds but it isnt enough for me to stay alive. 

Is it really worth it to push myself to go on?
Will there really be someone that can love me even though I carry all these problems with me?

Is life worth living?"
2427,"Im 16 and like, what’s the point?","I literally have 0 pleasure in life. Big fucking 0. League of Legends doesn’t make me feel good, weed and alcohol doesn’t make me feel good. It’s just fucking boring agony, and thought that this will last 70+ years only makes me want kill myself more. Plus 0 fucking chances of having any relationship with girl because of my looks. I don’t have any specific reason why i would end this so it’s not going to happen now, but in sure that at some point of my life i will fucking do it beacuse last time o felt good was in like 2014 or something. Ofc i have reasons but getting rejected by crush or realy bad grades aren’t enough. Sorry for my bad english, Im from Poland and for legal reasons it’s all made up. Thanks for Your time reading this shit."
2428,I’m just getting worse and worse,"I made a throwaway account because I’m too embarrassed to admit who I really am, but I need some help, or something. 
I’m 26 now, I’ll be 27 in a couple months, and I just feel like a big pile of worthlessness. I don’t have the motivation to do the things I love anymore... I used to paint, and I even had a few that won a few contests when I was in highschool, but whenever I try and pick up a brush now, I draw a blank, or I just can’t seem to find the motivation to do anything. I used to enjoy playing video games, but even that doesn’t seem to interest me these days. I don’t hang out with my friends as much as I used to, and whenever we make plans, when the day actually comes, I just can’t find the motivation to actually leave my house, and it kills me, because I cherish my friendships. I’m afraid I’m gonna lose them. 
The biggest thing that bothers me though, is the fact that I’ll never be happy like I was when I was in highschool. I would give up everything in my life right now to go back to my highschool years, and re-live it. I was happy, I didn’t worry so much about everything, I didn’t have to worry about an income to afford living... Maybe it’s selfish of me, idk, but I just wish I didn’t feel like this every single day. 
I’ve resorted to drinking, almost everyday just to numb my mind. It works, but I can’t help but feel like I’m just spiraling out of control. 
Everything just seems so pointless now, and I just want to die."
2429,I missed my own warning signs.,I somehow didn't notice the not even first time descent into depression. I know myself and my behaviors but I did put anything together until I was at the bottom of the pit and drowning. I feel like my own feelings are fake because they don't make sense and I don't know what to do.
2430,There’s no point in getting help anymore,"Background on me: I’m 24 and have been seeing the same psychiatrist since third grade. I’ve gone through multiple therapists over the years and have never been able to find one who didn’t make me feel worse about myself. I have severe depression and PTSD. To make things better, I’m physically disabled and I have trouble doing basic things. 

My psychiatrist recently told me in an appointment 3 months ago that he couldn’t help me anymore. I was desperate and extremely suicidal yesterday and needed to try anything to keep me from making my mom sad. I made an appointment.

In my appointment today, I was told, “nothing will help you” and “you can regress as much as you want but it won’t help you” and other stuff.

Deep down, I don’t think I want to die, but living hurts too much."
2431,My best friend just said she hates me,"She doesnt want to be my friend anymore. She was probably the only friend I had that I truly trusted, not to mention the closest friend I've ever had. I always went to her especially when I go through my depressive episodes. I'm going through one again and I can't find a way out. Everything is just weighing down on my chest and I can't breathe. I just don't wanna live anymore. If the one friend I thought i had ended up hating me, how am I supposed to convince myself I'm not alone. I just wanna end it."
2432,I honestly want to get hit by a car or something,"I just want something, somehow to kill me.

I don't want to be alive but i can't get myself to do it..

getting hit by a car would be awesome because i don't have to decide, it just happens."
2433,what are you guys dreaming about?,"I keep dreaming about tornadoes. 

meaning: ""Seeing a tornado in your dream suggests extreme emotional outbursts and temper breaks. You are overwhelmed and out of control and you forge a destructive path. The tornadoes occur less often and you have no way of determine the path that the destructive forces can take."""
2434,"whatever happens, happens",i dont know whats gonna happen anymore. If todays it then thats the way she goes.
2435,"I hate how when I’m vulnerable with my feelings on this subreddit, it is quickly dismissed by religious intervention. I just want to feel what I feel without judgement and passages being shoved in my face",
2436,Fuck it,"Life is complete bollox!! I fucking hate myself and this world! I hate myself for not killing myself sooner! And now feel somewhat obliged to wait until after Christmas as to not upset people! Everyday my life is getting worse and I just want it to be over! I pray and fantasize about death constantly. I want out and I want it now, I really hope I stop procrastinating and just fucking do it. Please let tomorrow be the last one...."
2437,I wish I was a girl,"I wish I'd like myself. I wish I could be happy. I wish people would accept me. I wish I had support. I wish I could ask for help.

But I'm too scared to change my life for the better. I'm so incredibly lonely and I can't do anything about it. I feel like I'm slowly dying because I've given up my hope for a fulfilling life. If only I was born as someone else."
2438,"My girlfriend attempted a suicide, now what?",I’ve read the sidebar and pinned posts. I still don’t feel like I’m capable of offering her support in a 100% safe way. What are good resources for people close to those who attempted suicide?
2439,I guess this will be it,"Don’t know why I’m even writing this honestly, would be surprised if anyone would even read it.

Soo I guess this is it, it’s 11pm here, I’m completely wasted somewhere on a fucking building, the height should be enough.

The only regret I have is that someone has to clean up after my dive, if you somehow read this, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to fuck up your day.

Im completely fucking done with everything, I only seem to be a source of money for a lot of people, am I even worth anything else ? Don’t know, guess I will never find out, had those thoughts since I was 14, thought by now I’d have an answer, I’m sorry my former self, I disappointed someone yet again.

I just want to make someone smile, just for once, and why not use the only thing people want from me ? 
Hey strangers! Since I don’t have a need for money anymore, I’d like to help you out ! Tell me what you need and I got you.
This subreddit has helped during dark times, even tho I never posted anything on here, it helped me, I thought people actually did care, thank you guys, I love you."
2440,Relationship issues have me depressed and lonely,"I started dating a girl in April of this year. Met her online, she went to highschool with me and lived on my street. 

We spent all summer together, we went on so many adventures and made so many memories. I honestly think in the past 8 months, we haven’t gone more than 1-2 days without seeing eachother because we live so close. It was convenient and beautiful and adventurous and just great. 

I loved waking up everyday and living and I was high on life. The relationship was often toxic. We often fought, never anything physical or screaming or anything. Not to point fingers, but it was often because she would be communicating with an ex or on dating apps. She claimed it was to “make friends” but I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable.

It passed, she stopped. She never physically cheated because we talked throughout the day and stopped by each others houses. 
We were on and off. Constantly “breaking up” but we still had sex and went on dates.

The other night... I was ordering her Christmas presents while she was at work. I noticed she had a dramatic increase in Instagram followers and I asked. She admitted she was on tinder, but again, just for friends. 

I let myself get out of control. I was sick of being lied to and feared being cheated on. I asked her to pick me up on her way from work. She did. I asked to look through her phone. She said no. I asked to look at her tinder messages to see if it was really for friends. She said no.

I lost it. I made a mistake I regret. I’ve never screamed so loud in my life. I’ve never said such horrible things. She said she wanted to stop talking to me. She said she wanted her clothes back. I told her to drop me off, my family was asleep and I needed space. She held me captive in her car until finally I screamed enough to scare her and get her to let me out. 

She texted my mom, calling me all these names, a psycho etc etc. I messaged her the next day to apologize and tell her we should talk and arrange for her to get her things. She called me names like I had done to her. We deleted and blocked eachother. My mom is now texting her about arrangement for her items being dropped off. My parents told me not to text her anymore and we were done with eachother.

I miss her. We had plans this week. We were in the middle of watching a show on Netflix together. We had plans for Christmas. It was all so sudden. I constantly forgave her and tried working on things when she would lie to me and stab me in the back.

Now I’m alone. I have zero friends, no one at school or work. And that’s another thing. I work with her tomorrow. It’s gonna take a lot for me not to try and talk to her. She worked today and probably already spread rumors about me to everyone.

My life feels like a mess and I feel like it’s over. I wish I had a time machine. I don’t know what I would’ve done differently but I would’ve done something different.

Now I’m alone. It’s winter and snowing and I’m alone writing this in my dark room with no one. I don’t have a friend. My family works all day and sleeps when they’re home. Winter break just started and it’ll be 4 weeks of this torture alone. All my plans with her down the shitter

I would give anything to just erase the other day, even if the relationship was toxic I’d rather have company and someone who I believed I loved. I don’t know what to do. I’m so beyond lost. So beyond confused and hopefully soon, dead"
2441,Why should I continue to struggle when relief is seconds away,"I'm so sick of being told that suicide is selfish. What's selfish is expecting me to live through this bullshit that I'm wrapped up in. I'm so fucking tired of busting my fucking ass off to be stuck in a cycle. All it took was being born under the wrong circumstances. 

I hate the random feeling of slashing my throat that I experience every godamn day. It used to make me cringe, but as of late its felt like a satisfying mental image. It could be over with one movement. Instead of spending every fucking day heartbroken, starving, and poor, I could spend 2 seconds checking out."
2442,Any family members of people who have committed suicide on here?,If your sibling killed themselves and you had just recently gotten out of rehab for alcoholism how likely do you feel you would be to relapse?
2443,Tired of it all (Kinda Long),"Im 19F and I've been depressed since 10th grade. Went to therapy but my parents made me stop cause it incovienced them and they said my depression was fake basically. I have no friends, never had never will probably. Too much abuse from people over the years has made me socially awkward and too anxiety ridden to even operate in society. I don't have a job and I've been desperately looking for one. My parents are gonna kick me out by the end of December.

My boyfriend is basically the only reason why Im still living but even then its getting harder these days. Hes so supportive and willing to help me and promises to give me a better life. We're long distance and have been together for 2 years. Hes saving everything he can to come see me and live together. 

Recently I've become more and more tired. Of everything. Im tired if being a burden to him. My panic attacks and suicidal thoughts worry him. Im tired of making him panic and worry. I'm tired if veing so dependent of him finicially and for emotionally. 

I'm tired of waking up everyday doing the same thing. Tired of being unable to do anything about being so fat and ugly cause whats the point? Im not going to amount to anything anyways. 

I've been contemplating suicide for so long. I just want this to be over with. I got the short end of the stick with the life lottery. I can't take much anymore. My only fears is that I don't want it to be painful, I'm scared what happens after death, and how will my boyfriend react..."
2444,I'm just too tired to exist like this,"I don't know what else to do. I've been living my life as best as I can and it's just never enough. It doesn't ""get better."" Not for me. It won't. It's not physically possible now. The only reason I've never attempted suicide is because I didn't want my body to go unburied and just rot. I don't care about that anymore. I believe in recognizing that one can either accept things as is and go on or take action to change. Accepting my life is not what I am worth; I deserve better. This is the only action I can take and, after four decades, I think I'm finally brave enough."
2445,Can someone please give me a reason to live.,
2446,"I wish time could stand still. I would have no responsibilities, no expectations to be held up against and I could breathe.",
2447,I had it all planned,"Today I was going to kill myself, all I needed was to be home alone, which is a common thing, but of course my sister had to be home today, hoping tomorrow I will have better luck"
2448,Give me one reason to keep going on.,"I have a few close friends who will miss me, but that doesn't matter when I'm constantly haunted by the fact I'm an idiot who everyone thinks is a joke with a temper even though I've worked hard on my temper and haven't had an outburst in 8 years. People stare at me everywhere, I have no family, my brothers always on meth and in and out of prison my uncle is a drunk living in an hotel and my moms dead and ive never met my dad. I'm troubled and will never have a relationship because I'm broken, I'm 6'4 27 and a decent looking guy most would say but I couldn't get a girl if my life depended on it because no one wants anyone who's broken. If I go get help I'm dead anyway because I'll lose my job and end up on the streets. So give me one good reason why I shouldn't do what I've been thinking about doing for 3 years now."
2449,I knew I should’ve killed myself today,
2450,I wish I had the willpower to cut through my veins,
2451,For everyone who is curious about any relatives/friends reactions to suicide,r/SuicideBereavement
2452,Can someone kill me plz,I don’t even care what you do. Just make sure I’m dead
2453,I wish I wasn’t so chubby and dark so I could actually see my veins...,
2454,"People think I’m well again because I keep up my appearance, wear nice clothes and only talk to them when I’m feeling good rather than when I’m having a hard time. I can’t have a good day without people assuming it’s all better. That I’m better. Well I’m not!!!!!!",
2455,It's my birthday and I'm beyond suicidal,"Today I turn 18.
No one knows I exist.
I shot up herion recently, I've been stealing opioid painkillers from my dad lately. I haven't cut in a few weeks and I hate it. My boyfriend only loves me because of the sex. I'm a schizophrenic, bipolar, drug addicted freak. I almost killed myself in February. 1000mgs of benadryl. But I fucking threw up, so I lived. Doctors told me me it was amazing that I lived. Feels like a curse. I've been abusing drugs for at least 3 years. I'm so tired of trying to be high. I'm so sick all the time. I've been raped by a former friend of mine, sexually abused when I was younger and emotionally abused all my life at home. It seems like I can't die. I'm thinking to take a shit ton of tramadol tonight and killing myself for good this time. Its not like I haven't tried. I feel pathetic. I can't do this anymore. I feel like everything is my fault. I'm a freak. Things only get worse, I don't ever see them getting better."
2456,Hey y’all having an anxiety attack just need some one to help or talk me through it but some one with experience,
2457,My friend is going through insane suicide intentions right now and he's always been there when I've needed him but I don't know how to help.,I'd just like some advice on what to say because he's always pulled me out of dark times and he's the only person in my life that I've ever cared about.
2458,I haven't been properly happy for 4 years now.,"I know this is way tamer than all of the other posts here, but I don't know where to turn anymore. I've wanted to die, nigh constantly, for just about 4 years now. My life is a shitshow, nothing has ever gone my way, and I'm always to depressed, anxious and hopeless to put effort into anything I do. Once I get home from sixth form every day, I cry for hours straight. I feel like less of a man for doing that. I also feel like less of a man for being bisexual, and I constantly feel like I'll fail in everything I do. It's gotten to the point where I've lost the only reason to live that I had. I just feel alone and terrible. I'm a horrible human being, and I bring out the worst in good people by being around them. No one likes me; I'm judged by everyone I know and I hate it. My life isn't ever going to get any better, so instead of waiting another 60 years, I should just commit now. Get it all over with."
2459,SERIOUS EMERGENCY! PLEASE HELP!,I don't have much time. Could a US redditor please help me? It has to do with someone being in danger and I'm not in the country to call emergency services. HELP!
2460,Idk,"Im 14 and depressed as fuck. When i was 6 i was raped by my friends older brother. I kept quiet. I also had sex with my younger sister and even just writing this still crushes me to my core. But i still kept quiet (i didn't even realize how bad it was until later). When i was 7, my family migrated to a different country with a different language. It was extremely difficult for me, i had no friends whatsoever. I was that weird kid who would draw at recess instead of play outside. I was mocked by other kids for my bad language skills and i hated myself for it. Fast forward a few years and i tell my mother about the incident, and she freaks. But she finally calms down. She tries to get me a therapist but i didn't really want one because my family doesnt have a lot of money (and its very hard to get a government funded therapist in third world countries) anyways fast forward a few years and i had to move schools (we didn't end up getting a therapist). It didn't go well. I was skipping classes, and getting to school really late, plus there was a bucket load of homework. Teachers sucked, no friends, and it was from 7:30 to 4:20 or even sometimes 5. This was the first time i legitimately considered committing suicide. I started slitting my leg and was crying almost every night. It got to the point where i stood on the balcony window a couple of times but decided that that wouldn't be such a good idea because it wasn't 100% going to be fatal. It was getting out of hand, i asked my mother for therapy and she ended up just paying for one instead. I went to therapy for a few weeks (once a week) but i had to stop going because we didn't have enough money to pay. I realized that a lot of my problems were coming from school so i proposed the idea to homeschool to my parents. They didn't want to hear it. But after some pestering they said they would think about it. It would take over a month to get it all sorted they said. And thats basically where i am now. I am not prepared to wait another month in this hell hole, and am planning to jump out of my schools highest window tomorrow. I was actually planning to do it today but decided not to. I know it'll crush their soul and I know im selfish but the pain is just too hard to bare..."
2461,More to life?,I was a really happy kid but with years of bullying and self hate rising I lost my identity. I’m not a miserable person. I just sometimes am. I just feel intensely. I can be a really happy person but more often then not I wanna die. I don’t get life. I feel like I don’t deserve anything I have. I feel like a loser. I guess hurt people hurt people. I wanna help others but it sucks that you can’t even help yourself. I think I’m more scared of living than I am of dying. I hate people because I hate who I am. I take pills now for depression and anxiety. I’m almost 16 and I’m not even in school. I don’t look forward much
2462,Living the life like a dog...lonely and poor. Trying to end it all faster.,"So I'm an almost 22 year old man from Romania, pretty average on looks can't say that I'm hideous neither a chad as my fellow incels like to call it, 5ft9 so I know kind of short. My problem is  that I was bullied since I was younger, my mom was supportive but but she couldn't do anything to stop the bullying,  on short teachers were useless too. This experience after some head wounds from my bullies gifted me with Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. Oh those two disorders work so well in tandem to make your life shitty, SSRIs ruin your libido, mood, weight swings...etc...I'm in uni and been jobless for a month. You know how depression is, everyone is happy, got friends ,go to clubs or hang together, I've been jobless for a month because my disorders put me into lot of troubles due to the fact that inattention made my managers and  colleagues to yell at me and stress me out, I was trying to be as fast as I could, and due to the stress I almost had a heart attack...so I had to resign, couldn't take it anymore, tried to find a more manageable part time job , but at shops like NewYorker, Zara etc..they usually want women ,so I had to try anything else, but due to my disorders I was refused, so I had to lie to find something...The problem is the stress made me to gain fat, also my flat mate is a scammer who took my guarantee money for my room now that he forces me to move because he befriended the owner and wants to be the only person who sits here. The stress made me to gain lots of fat, I never kissed a woman and I'm not very proud of myself  that I can't get a lover, tried to find this person...World is ending, I'm living by the poverty line, have to move into a studio with an elder woman to pay a cheaper rent, I'll have to be hired from Mcdonalds to KFC now which is like that, still harder ,struggling 1 year and a half more until my bachelor finishes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When you live in the poorest country in the europe ,nothing changes ,you live at the poverty line, people aren't to be trusted, and they are selfish, everyone asks for money but no one offers anything in exchange etc. Big taxes, big prices...Any you ? A virgin retard who barely can afford to eat something.. ..Yeah I'm from a second world country while third world countries live worse and they have nothing to eat, but it's like telling a man to stop eating because eating will not make you a better person, I have lots of problems ,and very very bad problems, can't handle them anymore. I tried suicide multiple times in the past. What type of life is that ? Also my inattention made me to lose all kinds of objects, I never had any friendss only friends that made fun of me and this is pretty much it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why to live ? For what ? The only times life was beautiful it was when I ate sugar, which made me to hate myself."
2463,Thought I was getting better and then the suicidal thoughts started intruding again.,"I have suffered bouts of MDD with psychotic features since I was eight years old. They got progressively worse til I was 18 and I finally started understanding myself enough to recognize when I was going into an episode and was able to start talking myself out of them. 

This past year has been different in that instead of having episodes of MDD with psychosis I've been consistently down and been experiencing suicidal ideation with a few close calls.

Last month I decided it was time to stop masking and seek treatment. I started taking Lovan and I have been starting to feel a little better. I stopped thinking about suicide altogether two weeks ago and have even been singing again, something I haven't done in years.

On Monday the best things happened. I got confirmation of full time employment after two years on disability basically begging for any work. My friend who is an author told me she was able to get more physical ARCs from her publisher and that she could give one to me. My partner was able to purchase my Christmas gift which had sold out twice already in the past month since it's release. 

It was a wonderful day.

Then last night my mood dropped significantly and I started thinking of suicide again. This morning I felt a little better but now here I am again feeling really down and suicidal.

I thought I was getting better but clearly I still have some work to do and now I'm anxious as fuck about my ability to even perform my new job.

I'm seeing my doctor this afternoon for something unrelated but I guess I'll have to bring this up.

I'm just so tired of fighting this."
2464,I don’t know what to do anymore,I was a really happy kid but with years of bullying and self hate rising I lost my identity. I’m not a miserable person. I just sometimes am.

2465,I do not really know what to write about..,"I came here for my last words several months ago but I was helped once again. And once again I just got here. I fuck up relationships, friendship whatever by my paranoid behaviour, probably insanity and regrets. I have so much to say, and please try to not help me it just gets worse, I just happen to make so many fucking mistakes everyone is throwing at me I did not even fucking remember. Now I feel like sticking a gun under my mouth and pulling the trigger because of the shame I am put in every day. I tried commiting suicide 2 years ago but failed and nobody found out. Since then it has been on my mind each week at least. Also running away to foreign countries, it may sound like I am a crybaby but I just happen to keep all my secrets for myself and I am not the first and the last to do that. I feel like where people will not recognize me I could start over. Finally. Thanks for your time. Do not contact me in any way, shape or form. Thank you. I was threatened by some cannibals too lol."
2466,3 problems,"Hello reddit. I have 3 problems exactly and would like a solution to be stated. Otherwise I feel like suicide is the optimal option for future.

1) My soul age (the age my brain feels) is probably higher than twice of my age (17M)

2) I'm smarter than 95% of people around me in many ways, which doesn't really help at all.

3) I have the rarest personality type (INFJ)

I feel like everyone around me are just kids playing and I am the man who has to bear that shit. There isn't even a single person who thinks the way I do, not even a little.

I started to freak out time to time in day. Having this urge to kill myself just gets bigger and bigger.

What shall I do? I'm lonely af"
2467,anyone else have significant others who haven't helped in the slightest? just tell you that life gets better?,
2468,I shan't live for much longer,"I posted something earlier explaining why I'm suicidal. I have Bipolar and social anxiety.

I'm thinking of suicide at the privative room for the parliamentarians of the Progressive Party, a party which is not progressive at all. It is amusing, I shook hands with some Members of Parliament and heard their talking and maneuvering. I was supposed to meet Rodrigo Maia, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, today but my meeting with him (if you can call it a meeting) was postponed to next Tuesday due to some demonstrations, hence it is only natural that I postpone my death. Why? I don't know, I feel like I should do something of the kind so I can at least feel that living some more months was worth something. I decided I shall die, I even decided when.

I'm lonely. I have no one and no one cares (I've even tried to send signals, to no avail). I'm tired of reaching out to people -- the fact that I'm always the one reaching out makes me pretty sure they don't care about me, but why would they? I'm depressed and like once a friend said ""no one is so enthusiastic about talking to someone who is so sad all the time"". The truth did hurt. I spend most of my time planning to die, listening to music (Piazzolla is one of the few things I can still appreciate), following politics and reading; besides that I spend most of my day with muscle pains, headache and feeling suffocated. I've started having nightmares about my brothers, specially about the one whom I trusted only for him to call the cops on us and promise me ˜suffering˜. Both my mom and sister keep shouting at me for every thing and I can't stand that anymore. My mom and my younger sister would rather spend money on tattoos and fashion than on my meds and my dad has ran away for the third time this year.

I finished high school this year (in fact, last week) and no one even remembered me when doing this year's retrospective. It was like I didn't exist. Heck, I was one of the best students for three years and no one could even mention that. I feel invisible. I feel like no one cares -- in fact, I'm pretty sure no one does. I'll die and I'll be quickly forgotten.

My deepest wish is for someone to care, someone to ask candidly how I am and just to hug me. My deepest wish is to be able to talk without any of my problems, be able to pronounce all the letters properly. I'm somewhat proud I managed to live for that long with all my issues."
2469,When our freezer died I lost everything. I lost what I worked so hard on for the past two months so I could give my son the best Christmas he could have with me- the first Christmas where I’m not unhealthy or in hospital. Fuck.,"I reached out for ideas on a sub of what to do with the low amount of money I have left and basic ingredients I can bake with and it was locked, they assumed I was indirectly soliciting money. I wasn’t. People offered to help me in PM and I said it was a kind gesture but no. I thought I would be able to get more ideas.

But I lay in bed all night tossing and turning, wondering if I just come across as pathetic as I think I am.

I just needed reassurance that I can still make-ends-meet. That I can impress him at least a little with what I had done. Fuck I had done so much. It’s hard to stay positive about it. I can’t stop crying.

His Dad’s family are wealthy and business oriented people. I’m unemployed and attending an outpatient programme for the next year because I’m constantly in and out of hospital.

I just wanted help with ideas, my heart was broken and I couldn’t think of anything beyond rice and beans or scones. Reassurance by people who are in situations like myself right now who can tell me what I can do with what I have.. 

I’m going to keep trying. But it’s a massive blow to me at home that this has happened and I overthink everything so the idea of being thought of as some dirty anonymous user trying to take money just made me feel- disgusting.

Please don’t offer anything to me if you’re thinking about it- I will never take anything. I just want to get this off of my chest because it’s becoming an obsessive thought and I need to put it here instead.

I hope you have a good Christmas."
2470,My Husband Told Me He Thinks I Can Never Be Happy,He’s probably right. I just don’t want him to get hurt if something happens to me. I wish he’d never met me.
2471,I lost every single thing I had stored in our freezer for Christmas and dinners for the next 8 days. I did so much work. I prepped for weeks. I asked for help on a sub for ideas on what I can do with the only $85 I have and it was removed because they thought I was taking money. I feel dirty.,"I don’t want money. I told the few people who messaged me to keep their money and that they were kind enough to even offer. My son is here over for these 8 days- I have so much to try and scavenge together to make ends meet. I just wanted ideas on what I can do with what I have. Honestly! I just needed reassurance that I can still do it.

Doing all of this work with pre-meals, baking, Christmas meats, meats for dinners, vegetables, treats ect- it’s all gone. 

Please don’t offer to help me, I really don’t want it. I just want somebody to hear how heartbroken I am. I struggle with BPD, BIPOLAR II, INSOMNIA and PTSD. It’s taken a huge hit on me. Christmas is already a horrible time- it’s when my Dad has started giving me to his friends twelve years ago. I have the worst time around this year. I just wanted to have a good week with my son because I haven’t been healthy for Christmas for four years with him.

I’m fucking deflated, man. I’m pushing on but I’m scared it won’t last and I’ll attempt to off myself again like I did mid-November. 

I’m going to keep on trying to do my best with the ideas those good people did suggest."
2472,Wanna die but don't have the energy to try or even cut though I wanna relapse so bad or just die. I'm tired of this shit but I'm too much of a coward.,
2473,I'm scared,"I'm scared of failing, I'm scared of not succeeding and not going to university which is extremely important to me because I'm scared of failing to use my potential. I'm scared that I will be no one and end up in a dead end job not ever getting anywhere in my life and I just want it all to stop. But I can't because I have someone who truly loves me but I feel like I can never give them the life they deserve and that they would be able to find someone better. This is all too much"
2474,I’m a total failure,"I can’t even do decent in school, I got a very low grade on two different subjects, and nothing is improving. I’ll never succeed, ever. I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me, I can barely even function properly without feeling like shit. I basically forgot to submit two different parts of the task, and did horribly on the test, getting a 2/7 at most. I’m such a idiot, incapable of doing the simplest tasks without failing.

I don’t even have any motivation to do anything left, just enough to stress about stuff, but not enough to do anything productive. I literally don’t feel happiness anyone, life just sucks."
2475,If I don’t do well in Organic Chem and another class my life is forfeit as far as I’m concerned. Like if I can’t even get the degree I need to succeed there is no other way for me to achieve my goals in life.,"I don’t see the point of living if I fail. There is no point. Imagine being placed in a class you won’t ever use in your life. Imagine talking to others in your field and then never having to use Organic Chem for anything. 

It’s all bs, if they wanted to thin the herd they won. I’m done if I fail. Peace"
2476,I’ve given up on life,"This is just too much for me, I’m too weak for this shit. I’ve been having some very strong suicidal feelings and I decided to seek treatment, lean on friends and start medication, none of it helped.

I’ve been taking a shit ton of Ambien recently and sadly it’s losing it’s effect, I can’t even get proper sleep anymore. I feel more alone than ever despite seeking help from everybody, this is too much for me.

I’m looking into a sure way to end it all, I was thinking of purposely OD’ing but the survival rates aren’t “good” enough for me. I guess I need to find a way to hang myself, I broke the only fixture in my room trying to do it some time ago and now I need to find some place to do it. I’d like to die in the middle of the woods at night but I don’t like the thought of scaring anybody who finds me.

Sorry for whining this much, I just don’t have anywhere else to go"
2477,I picture my graphic death to avoid it,"When I’m close, like really close to finally doing it. I sit and picture it, try to feel it.
Like stepping in front of a train. I picture the wind, the sound of the horn, I picture the seconds before it hits me and then the crunch of my body as pain rips through it, every bone breaking my skin ripping apart. 
It’s almost euphoric doing this. Like for a brief moment I actually did it. I feel strong and not scared anymore for just a few seconds until i realise it’s not happened.
From here I usually sob uncontrollably for a while, or maybe even picture different deaths. I often feel better afterwards-which is fine. But one day I’m hoping it will push me to do it"
2478,Going to kill myself because I can't make friends.,"Aside from the fact that I have 0 social skills, my town is a complete shithole there is no where to go and meet people. There are no classes, no clubs, no meetups. Everything is 2 hours away in a completely different city. All year I've been trying to find something and it all failed. I couldn't even join a club at school my schedule kept interfering. At this rate I don't see myself ever finding someone combine that with having a family that doesn't care, and the hotline being useless, I am totally alone and I'll kill myself before new years I'm not going through this endless cycle of failure and isolation anymore."
2479,Lost my last two friends this week. I'm so scared and lonely.,
2480,Is this normal,"Since I can remember I’ve had suicidal thoughts. (27M, first memory of them was at 13). It’s like a voice in the back of my head. Everyday. Sometimes it’s louder than others. Recently I’ve had the voice louder,l. Every inconvenience, every small quip from someone, the voice just says “ugh kill yourself, I want to die”. 

I’ve just succumbed to living like this. It’s just become exhausting. My brain is broken and I’m drowning."
2481,I am not for this world.,"I am kinda just waiting to die, I am living for my mom but idk how long I can hold on. I wish i could die in an  accident or in my sleep. I want to scream and cry so hard but i can't."
2482,Can I talk to someone?,
2483,"I am so alone and am in so much pain, I am at a loss for how to cope","No friends, only family does not like me (that is fine - nobody owes anyone anything - my personality is pretty shit).  
I am in chronic pain that never ends if I am awake.  It is hard to sleep.  I probably have some mental stuff going on, but not enough to excuse my shortcomings.  I am only 40 and just do not want to be here any more"
2484,I'm still alive!,"On saturday I took a massive overdose. I didn't realise it was massive because I only got halfway through before calling 999 but it was. And it really fucked my body up.

I haven't actually told anyone the extent of how bad it was yet and I kind of just want to get it off my chest.

Luckily the ambulance came quite fast, within 30 minutes. When I arrived at A&amp;E I vomited, I was shaking a lot and it just got worse. I felt really hot and started sweating, my heart was racing, I might have been drifting out of consciousness (I kept saying it felt like everything was a dream) and I started twitching. Also probably a side effect of feeling like shit and not getting medical attention for a while but it felt like time was going incredibly slow. At one point after I got a doctors attention they connected me to a heart monitor and I had a feeling from his reaction it wasn't good but he wouldn't tell me.

My memory really goes to shit here, probably a side effect of the seizure I had. I remember at some point I asked a nurse if they were going to pump my stomach, she said they probably would have done that by now.

I remember at one point I was on the phone to my mum. And then I was eating custard creams at one point as my blood sugars went low. I didn't really know where I was or what was going on. I was kept attached to a heart monitor and had insulin going into one arm and a drip of I think potassium and glucose into the other. Apparently my heart rhythm went weird and irregular on saturday as well. I was released from the hospital on monday night.

I still don't feel fab. Stomach pain, nausea and also back pain (probably from the seizure). 

I am so glad I'm still alive and this experience was absolute hell. I don't think I'll ever try to kill myself again although I know I'll still have suicidal thoughts. Please trust me when I say you do not want to take an overdose."
2485,I ruin everything in my life,"Every year I say that this is the time I am going to change and I am going to get better and stop being this horrible burden of a person. I wish they would’ve let me die last year in the hospital, they took it away from me and this is all I have left. Me. Just me. I’m all alone again like I was when I was a little girl, and no one knew what was going on with me and neither did I but it all ties together in this fucked up cycle. My friends have all abandoned me, my sister told me I should just kill myself already. My mother says she hates me threatens to call the police on me and then acts like nothing ever happened. My father calls me a bitch and told me I don’t do anything. Someone one told me I was intelligent. But I know I am not smart, Bc you can’t hide the truth from yourself. I am more than just unhappy. I am a stranger, I don’t know what happened to me. I see pictures of myself as a girl and I weep for her, who would’ve thought this is where we’d end up. I can’t stop self harming even though I am 20 years old. Everyone who understood me has vanished and I am here empty and in so much pain. I don’t know what to do anymore. My life has been a waste and a mistake."
2486,i heard somewhere that you can psyche yourself out into making yourself happy,"by just forcing yourself. pretending to be happy until you actually are

it worked for a while i think but. at the end of the week i just relapsed for the first time in a while, triggered myself, and immediately the thoughts just came flooding back in. 

“i should kill myself right now.” “if somebody said they’d kill me, i’d beg them to do it” “i’d slit my wrists with this if statistics didn’t say i’d likely survive.”

i’m just tired. i’d nap if my meds didn’t prevent me from it. i feel like i want to get better but i keep sabotaging myself so i don’t really know

just wanted to vent i guess. i hope you all have a lovely day."
2487,I can't handle the hand I've been dealt anymore,"I've been in an abusive marriage for 11 years..... and I can't seem to escape no matter how hard I try. I'm not allowed to get angry or fight back whenever he does anything. He uses everything against me, he's yelling constantly and always telling me I'm crazy. I can't handle the amount of pressure he always puts on me. A few years ago I made a friend at school who said they wanted to help me... he degraded me and would oscillate between being helpful and hurtful. So much of what I went through with my husband was mirrored with what happened in that friendship. Hearing their words hurts so much. I feel like I have no future or ability to move on with my life. I worked really hard to get to where I'm at but I can't handle everything that's happened. They both told me its my fault and I""m always the victim. I can't handle this anymore."
2488,I am so calm,"I'm going to suicide in an hour, but I feel so calm. Did anyone else had this."
2489,What's left when I'm done talking?,"I've been done talking about it for about six months, but things never improve, no matter how hard I try. At this point talking doesn't help anything. There's no words that can make me see the value in this life and I'm just gone. Sealing the deal feels like more of a formality"
2490,I feel like such a coward because I can't kill myself,"Long story short I felt like shit today and when I was coming home, I went down to the riverbank and thought about jumping in. Needless to say it didn't happen, because I am a pussy. I found a good spot to jump in but then of course I did not, I mean I kinda knew when I went there, and kept telling myself ""of course you are not going to do it, you pussy"" and then guess what, I didn't. Such a fool. I should, really should. But I'm so fucking pathetic and stupid and cowardly, I never actually will."
2491,I'm so tired.,"My entire life feels like it's only leading to collapse, and every day I find myself crying whenever I wake up and realize that I was just dreaming, even when it was a nightmare.

My dog died a few years ago. Her death hit me the hardest of anything in my life. I've wanted to stop existing since I was eleven, having the constant nagging feeling of wanting to just drop dead, but she held it back. Gave me purpose.

I wanted to finish my school and get a job to help her, give her the best life I could. Normally I would've been roughly twenty or more years by the time she passed, and I thought that would buy me the time to make up my life after taking care of her.

But she died so much worse than I could've imagined. Started suffering from Canine Mega-esophagus, became unable to eat or drink. I tried to help her in any way I could. I didn't spend a moment away from her, even when she wanted to leave. I wanted to make her feel loved.

But eventually we had to put her down. She died scared, starving, dehydrated, in a vet she was afraid of and hated. She looked at me for help and support when she fell asleep and got the injection. I betrayed her. She wanted safety, and I gave her death.

Ever since then, it was a downward spiral. My mother had been mean, cruel, even, to me, since I was six. Calling me things like a 'Cockroach', saying I was a 'Constant drain' on her, and that i'd 'Never get anywhere with what I was doing', for eleven long years. Any time I tried to refute her, she would scream at me to shut up and take away my pet or my computer or what - have - you - not. Recently, she's just been screaming at me more and more angrily, saying that I 'have no excuse to be doing poorly', and that i'm a terrible son.

My father always never cared, no matter what happened. He wasn't there to support me or provide me happiness, only to shrug and slip me a dollar or two maybe once every few months, but he sure as hell came up to belt my ass or scream for thirty plus minutes on end if I ever fucked up.

Neither ever let me interact with any of my friends, go out to meet with people, or do anything on my own. But they also didn't care whenever I encountered bullying or name - calling, so I know it wasn't to protect me.

They got my therapy in order to pawn off responsibility, and i've been enjoying my therapist, but I wish I didn't. They've just been using it as a method to hurt me. To say 'You have therapy, you should be better!' and things like that, saying now I have even 'less' of an excuse to be 'worthless'. Worse is that my mother's been turning my diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder against me, saying that i'm only using them to 'Shield myself', or even that i'm 'Faking it to get rid of responsibility', when not once have I said anything about it to her, and have constantly asked her to stop bringing it up.

I've been held back in school twice, nearing thrice, now, because I just don't care. I just want to leave this world and die. I got a cat thinking it would help, but all I can think about is how much better I could've been as a parent to him if only I wasn't such a piece of shit.

I can't sleep no matter what I do. I don't want to work in a job i'll hate for days on end, chasing only a few hours of happiness each day, forced to live on someone elses' terms, but I can't fucking handle going to school again and again only to fail each time because of my incompetence. I can down six to eight entire doses of Melatonin and sleeping meds with no effect, and the only thing that helps sleep anymore is hard liquor.

My friends can't help. Some of them try to, some of them sympathize me, but at the end of the day, sympathy is only sympathy. It can't help me any. What's worse is that to most of them i'm just the butt of the joke, the person to make fun of. I hate it so much.

And it's not like I can get any more friends. I have to constantly second - guess myself, am always fearful whenever I encounter even the slightest difficulty talking. I have no restraint or ability to stop myself from speaking anything on my fucking mind, and when I do, it usually leads to me pushing buttons with friends or doing something overboard, and I always have to either reign myself in and watch the conversation like a hawk, or worry and stress over if anything I said was too far, and they're just too kind to mention it.

I've tried to kill myself via dehydration twice, but didn't have the willpower to go through with it. I just want to bite the fucking bullet, taste a gun. I don't even have money to purchase a firearm to end it all.

Why does it have to be this way?"
2492,I would 100% be ok with being murdered,"I will never be able to kick this mindset. I want to die but I will know I will never muster up the courage to do it so I'm left to suffer. Being murdered sounds literally fantastic. No honestly, like it would be a win/win for both parties. I go to bed dreaming of it every night. Fucking so tired of this shit. I am truly so fucking over it. Dying alleviates me of **ALL** problems at the very small sacrifice of living. Sounds like a WIN to me."
2493,I'm drowning.,
2494,I feel weak for not being able to go through with it.,"I attempted 16 days ago. 2 nights ago i almost attempted again, but i just couldn't. I just can never go through with it. I'm too scared. I just want the pain to stop, i just want to be at peace and sleep forever. I keep thinking about my friends. Most people won't care if i'm gone but i know a few will. Only 2 people would care if i was gone. I don't want to hurt them. I wish they spoof just stop caring about me so it would make this easier. Also, my pain tolerance is still low. When i attempted i cut up my legs badly, but i couldn't get deep enough because of the pain and my small blade, so i gave up. I want it to be over so badly."
2495,Someone please help me I'm so tired of fighting,I'm so tired of the day in day out worry and anxiety I pray for release bit it doesn't come. Can't eat or sleep . My life has become so I can't even cry anymore.. please god
2496,30th December is the day,"I can't bare to see the new year in, I'm getting help but i don't think people know how much i'm hurting even though I've told them everything. I don't want to hurt anyone in my life but literally everyone is moving away to university next year anyways. I'm so alone and knowing people go through the same shit makes me feel worse because I don't want anyone to suffer like this too. I'm going to jump off a bridge and I know it'll kill me"
2498,At my lowest point. Contemplating ending things tonight,"I feel like I'm at my limit. I cant take the emotional up and down I just need it to stop. Sleep doesnt help as I dream about my issues every night. There is literally no escape. I find no joy in anything. I dont feel scared about trying anymore, so it's a good time to try."
2499,I'm probably going to kill myself tonight,"Already have a note written, got my plan. I'm sick of living so sick. I'm in school right now an ive already researched methods.. I can't do this anymore"
2500,I miss my dad so much :( 💔👼🏻,"I miss my dad 💔

Is it fucked up of me to say that nothing could ever make me as happy as my dad use to make me?? 

I can physically feel it. 

I know I will have my happy moments through life... 

But I also know and feel like nothing could ever top being with my dad. 

He was my best friend... 

And he killed himself... 

I still live in the house where it happened.... 

I can’t move because this house was given to me when he died and I don’t have the money... 

I’ve been having flashbacks of finding him after he did it.... 

I just want to be with my dad 

These 3 years have felt like 30 :( 

Should I go back to therapy? 

I don’t wanna bother people with my problems or make anyone scared :(( 

But to be honest I just wanna be with my dad. 

I don’t care about anything I have here. 

That makes me sound so ungrateful when I’m not. 
I’m so thankful for what I have. 

But this ache is too much 😔"
2501,Release,"I’m in so much fucking pain. I just want to lie down. I hate living like this. I don’t know what exactly I do to deserve this bullshit that happens to me. I guess it’s because of my sexuality. Whatever that can go wrong does go wrong in my life. Anytime where I’m feeling somewhat fine, something bad happens to me to put me in my place. I have no clue why but this just hurts. I’m always left alone so that’s the only thing I’m used to. I can only suffer in silence now. Trying to get through this so the pain can go away. I am so angry and exhausted. Why live this life when my future looks so dim? People are so lucky to be normal and loved. To be seen as respectable and a good human being is all I want."
2502,Can anyone give me advice?,I’ve been procrastinating on my suicide for the longest time I need help. What can I do to not be afraid and just hang myself already? Can anyone help me?
2503,"I pray to God everyday that he takes me away, because I can’t do it myself.","I have my family who loves me and they’ve done nothing wrong to deserve this. They are the only reason I haven’t done anything yet. If I would ever take my life myself I would just cause them too much pain. But I just am so disgusted of myself and of letting them down that I don’t want to be here, so I pray to God everyday that he somehow takes me."
2504,"Im tired of pretending, so hopefully cancer will take me first and I don't have to end it myself","No one and I mean NO ONE would take me serious if I told them I'm sick of living but scared to die.
I'm mixed race, African and white. Grew up in the 80s in the USA when it wasn't cool. Constantly bullied till I got puberty. Then I was suddenly pretty. 
My parents are crack addicts. My father raised my in 20 different government paid homes and abused me. My mother who is bipolar and also an addict ran off when I was 12. Not to mention she used to beat the shit out of me.
I went without food alot. And when we had food I would starve myself so my siblings would eat. I would just curl up and sleep for days.

I was raped, beaten, emotionally abused and homeless as a teen. 
I sent myself to military school on a grant someone told me about, graduated early at 15 went to college out of state. Where I was drugged raped, humiliated. Worked two jobs and went to school full time. Then my mother's family gave me to a 20 year old man to marry so I wasn't their financial burden and blamed religion.

I smarten up alil when I turned 19 and ran off. Met the guy I'm with now. Fast forward to when I had 3 kids. Now he is emotionally distant, only comes homes to eat a screw. I thought he was cheating cause he talked to girls online all the time. So I started talking to guys and his pay back was making me anally rape myself with a dildo. The church and my family kept us together and I tried to be good. But after I had twins(yes now 5kids) and a high paying job I wanted out. So I slept with my best friend. 

I never left btw. Hubby just figured out what was going on one day. Stopped neglecting me. And when I left out of state  with my kids he followed. 
I stilled talked to the best friend. Hubby was ok with it cause we didn't live near each other it was emotional support.  We had an agreement. He married, I'm married. Stick to each other. Dude got a little tiny bit of confidence (he is ugly) and decided to start doing porn, unprotected, open gang bangs, glory holes. I found him on a website,thru a tip from a friend. No warning. Just 18 years of friendship gone. 
Then I got cancer, then I was cured oddly fast(still in remission)
Then my other best friend abandoned me. No explanation, nothing.
Then my favorite author died, then I guy on the road In front of me. 
Diagnosed with bipolar type 1
Found out I was preggo with miracle baby at 4 months, baby almost died, baby lived. Now I somehow have more kids.

Hubby has a new fetish, want to watch me with other ppl and open the relationship. Just as my last living, grandfather, grandmother one of my great aunts and an amazing co worker all die in a 2 year span.
I'm depressed. I don't take meds. I just smoke weed and go to work. If you met me you would say""she is so pretty and amazing and funny and happy. I am the Robin Williams of my field. Plus I tested out at 141 IQ so I fucking over think everything and find a way to fix ppls problems when no one else can. I'm the person that is there last minute, at 3am in a thunderstorm just to bring coffee and a hug.
When I die it will be a packed house. 
I take care of me.

My bedroom and the bathroom are where I go to stop panic attacks. My husband knows this. I have brought up to him that my bed is off limits for his hook ups. I left town for my son's surgery and he had a girl over for what was considered a get to know meeting.. I told him it would be ok to start looking for a second wife. He got her high. And slept with her in my bed. My other kids where home. That's why I thought it was safe. I know u probably think I'm stupid. But I trusted him. He fell in love with her. Keep in mind my grandparents only died a couple months ago. I was bawling everyday. And when I asked him to cut her off and give me time to grieve. Her screamed at me in the scary way. Called me a selfish bitch and said I was allowed to have my friends. (I hadn't been with anyone else In 3 years at this point) I explained that,I'm the only one that works, I cook ,I clean, I take care of shit I need time to heal. We are almost 40 so he paid me back by sleeping with 2 other 20 year old. In my bed and on my couch. Worst part is I actually met one and liked her. But she is ugly and has a hard time talking to him. So he said no. Continued with his obsession. Behind my back. I would sneek and read the messages. 

I go to nudist stuff and meet new ppl. I NEVER have sex with anyone. It is therapeutic for me. To be free. And no one touches you. The most I do is I spank ppl with a stick when they ask. He knows this. 
I live him deeply. Truly deeply. But even when he says I was wrong you can tell he still wants his way. 
Now he works where I work. Which was nice at first. We need the money. But he wants me to feel bad about him being tired and cater to him. Im tired too. 
For his birthday he wants me to have dinner with the first girl. Wants me to help him with the restaurant, call her and ask her to come. It makes me sick. But I'm going to do it. Cause he said I could invite the ugly one too. I do like her. She is sweet and giving and I need ppl like her around. The first girl is in a relationship. Her boyfriend doesn't know about my husband. I don't want to break them up cause he will scream at me and leave me. I'm going to let this happen cause I don't really have any control. Whenever he think he can't have his way he ignores me and gets all moppy. 


I'm pretty sure my cancer is back. Tired for no reason, loose stool, lymph nodes are swollen. Random welts that itch, nausea and alll the lovely sign it brings. And I'm ok with that. I was never meant for all this. I was brought here to produce my beautiful intelligent amazing kids. 
I won't kill myself until my oldest leaves. I'll probably have a shit ton of reason by then.
If I do nothing about my health. The beautiful cancer with just gobble me up. Then I won't be in pain anymore 

I tired of ppl using me. I'm really pretty. Like without makeup in a model. I look 29 and I have an amazing firm figure. But people are intimidated by me. They won't actually hit on me in person or be romantic. Online is fine. But once they see I'm actually pretty they lock up and get nervous. It's a massive turn off for me. I need to have a conversation first. That's why I haven't had sex with anyone else since the best friend debacle.

I LOVE MY HUSBAND. I WOULD DESTROY AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE FOR MY KIDS. 

BUT I CANT fight for me anymore. I just wanted to tell someone. Anyone without feeling shamed or stupid or worse. I just want someone to know a tiny piece of my fucked up story that no one else knows. 

I live everyone and everything. I would probably love you if I met u.
My suicide story is simple.
Cancer or empty nest. Maybe I'll look 40 when I'm in my late 50s and be casket sharp. Maybe something tragic will take me first. I've outlived ALOT of ppl(not counting family). 
I just hope someone somewhere forgives me.
I never understood what it meant to just be tired of living
Now I do
Now I get it
I want out
I've had to fix my own life, take care of my own emotions with minimal support. My family and siblings that I helped raise and keep alive. Refuse to talk to me or ignore me. My own brother lives around the corner. So does my mother. Yes she magically appeared one day and doesn't care what happened to me. It's all about her and her needs now. 

No one but my kids and my hubby want to know what I'm doing. I feel like I've worked so hard to show I care. And they all blow me off. 

I love u guys, I love everyone and hopefully one day when u here about a 55 year old mother of 6 tragically passed at her own hand. Or that I died from stage three cancer
U think of me, are sad a little then smile cause 
""Damn at least she isn't in pain anymore""

2509,I want to end it,"Im a trans girl, I just want to be a real girl. I want to stop being a stupid tranny and just wished I was born fucking right to begin with."
2510,I need to do it or get committed,"Whenever I reach out to friends or family about wanting to end things, they get mad at me because they feel like I’m putting it all on them. I don’t mean to do that but I know it would be selfish of me to do it without trying to get help first. 

I’m also a college student with one scare before that landed me in the hospital and then a whole thing just to get back on campus. When this happened, I wasn’t even at my lowest or even serious about it. 

Now I am. And every time I ask for help it’s always “I can’t” and I know it’s not about me, it’s about their personal lives and what’s going on with them but it just feels like everyone in my life is done with me. And I’m done with me too.

I want to die so badly but I’m afraid of not doing it correctly and then being forced to live and possibly kicked out of school and labeled “the girl who tried to kill herself” for the rest of my life.

What’s the right way to overdose? Should I drink as well? I need to end things soon because there’s no point"
2511,Drove in the opposite direction of traffic hoping to get myself killed quick.,"Feeling very suicidal as of late. I'm feeling a lot of guilt and sadness and I don't know how to deal with it. I used to be able to cope better but things has been really tough lately. Whenever I drive, I have the overwhelming urge to drive into a huge ditch or over a bridge and just get it over quick. Tonight I came really close to doing that. But I was fighting against it so bad. I didn't want to hurt some strangers just because I was selfish. 

I have friends but I don't feel safe telling them how I feel. And the adults around me doesn't make me feel safe enough to confide in either. I feel completely trapped and I can't see any way out of it. 

I might update a story on how I got to feel this way but right now my mind is so tired. All I could think about is that I'm hoping I'll die peacefully in my sleep tonight."

2514,"I don't want treatment or to do anything, I just want to die with dignity","I've been suicidal for the majority of my life, and I knew I would eventually get to a breaking point.   
I've been to several different therapists and been on god knows how many programs by now. Nothing has helped. I've kept going cuz at least it looked like there was light at the end of the tunnel. I'm in a place right now where there isn't even a theoretical out for me.   
I'm still recovering from a breakup from like two years ago. We started as close friends, dated for a bit, but she went back to her ex. Any girl I meet, I instantly get FOMO. ""She's cool, but she is not like her...."". I do not want to downgrade, not after learning what's out there. No way.   
More relevantly, what's going on now. I've dicked around doing god knows what after high school, wasted a shitload of time. Studying part-time didn't work. Currently, I'm studying full-time, year 2. My GPA is still nothing to be proud of, but still worth continuing. On top of that, I'm on the brink of financial ruin. I'm trying to find a part-time job that will accommodate my schedule, so far, nothing. I'm close to exhausting what I've had saved up and/or loaned. If I file for bankruptcy, I'll certainly not be able to make something out of my life. I'm not going back to working dead-end jobs, and, as with my ex, I'm too proud to take up anything less than tech.   
I want to cut the bullshit. I feel like trying to do anything of this point is just a massive waste of time in a pit of stress and misery, and I can't be bothered with it anymore.  I want to die in peace."

2517,I don't know why I feel this way,"Maybe I just wanna leave some sort of proof that I was not ok so my family and my boyfriend can see it after I do it. Maybe I am not completely sure if I will although I've been thinking about it a lot this years. I've changed careers, I've lived alone, lived with my boyfriend, went to therapy, moved back with my parents...I just seem to be always sad? And yeah, it goes away every now and then, I talk about a future and I get excited but then something hits me, many times things that probably will go wrong, past actions that will stop me from following that future I imagine...and it comes back. 
I am tired of feeling like this, it is exhausting, it is exhausting to fake it, to wait til someone realizes, I am tired of pretending and taking away time from my family, my friends and my boyfriend. 
I am supposed to get married next year and I want to do it but at the same time, I would rather kill myself before so it doesn't really affect my boyfriend legally? I dunno, it is stupid, right? I wanna kill myself and I need to figure a way to do that won't look like suicide so my parents can get my insurance money and at least I help them that way...I wanna kill myself but I don't wanna hurt my boyfriend like that...I want to kill myself and God knows that I tried to get better but maybe it was always meant to be and it is time."

My brain is broken to the point where I lose interest in everything after long enough doing it. I quit my career because programming became too unbearable, I barely hang out with others because I'm bored by people, I barely like video games anymore, and attempts to pick up new hobbies like art have just led to me eventually not wanting to do it anymore. Even getting through a day like this is an absolute challenge.

I've tried everything too - medications, multiple therapists, getting tested for ADHD, TMS... The world just doesn't have a solution for me and it's becoming clear that this is my life now. An endless sea of gray that I don't want to live in. Anything I try is absolutely pointless and just leads to more suffering. So I'm seriously looking into suicide now, doing my research on methods, etc. It might be difficult and scary, but I think it's for the better. Others say they want me here but they clearly overestimate my importance and will see eventually I bring nothing but disappointment to the world. I still don't want to die right before the holidays because I want my family to enjoy those, January seems like a good time."
2519,"""You need to forgive yourself""","I get it. I've changed, I'm not longer bullying people, I'm more understanding for others than ever. I truly am a loving person, always have been. I work with kids and not to brag, but they love me. Or maybe just messing with me, but anyways I bring them joy, and I admit, I am proud of that.

Still, I don't forgive myself. I can't. The pain thinking about how much misery I've caused others, the pain thinking the things I did and said.

I want to say, ""What if somebody else did what you did? Would you think they deserve to die?"" Perhaps not, but I truly don't think anyone I know could ever be as nasty as I was. I bullied and tried to ruin the lives of my own (at one time) friends, because I thought they secretly hated me, and wanted to use me, and were fake friends. I thought this because I hated myself so much, I thought everyone actually hated me. Surely nobody could truly like somebody like me.

The person I was actually cruelest to forgave me and is talking to me again. However, I still can't forgive myself. I feel like I just deserve to die. Slowly. I want to hurt myself so bad.

I just feel like I'm dying, I would probably be in a hospital if it weren't for my dad, I don't want to br stress him out. I fucking hate this.

Nobody would love me the same if they knew how I've acted before.

There are other things I hate myself for. I hate my weight, face, physical and emotional weakness, stupidity, lack of creativity and skill in anything. I want to fucking die."
2520,Sometimes I feel like suicide is a gene,"I’ll start off by saying I have a great job, (I don’t like it but it’ll set me up for the rest of my life if I stay) my first legitimate girlfriend who I adore beyond words, some good friends. But I still have those incredibly intrusive thoughts that turn into a suicide plan or just an action on a whim. Like rolling my car or cutting my throat. So, sometimes I think, am I SUPPOSED to kill myself? Like I always want to because I’m never going to achieve my goals in music so my brain tells me “just get it over with, you won’t have to worry anymore.” I entertain the idea more times than others but I don’t wanna hurt my girlfriend or my friends. And I’ll miss my cats. But even though I have all these things I still feel empty and sad and can’t imagine myself making it to 30. So maybe it’s in my genetic code and I’ll just act on my impulse decision one day."
2521,I told my therapist that I'm going to suicide and all he cared about was to give me medince.,"A therapist should get to know their patients and make them feel comfortable, as far as i know.
So today i went to this therapist my brother told me about, because of my issues and suicidal thoughts. I started talking from my highschool years up til now ( 7 years. ) There were 2 people in the waiting room so i knew i wouldn't take much time with my story because i kinda revised it to only tell him the important events. I started talking and talking and as i was going for the part i wanted to tell, he seemed bored and gave an indifferent irritated expression on his face and said : "" I'm waiting for the part where you tell me how you're feeling now "" i said : "" i wanna kill myself and i feel super worthless "" to which he replied "" that's what i want to hear so i can give a medince "" i told him i just wanted to talk and for someone to hear. As he was writing the prescription i continue to talk and all he replied was with  Aha, oh, okey.. Humm, i see. When he finished in the middle of my talking he went directly to the door and said to take this medicine seriously. I was perplexed and understand that my time was up (about 20 mints) and walked me to the secretary where he told me to see another doctor if I don't want medicine, and i went out. This doctor has reputation ngl, but all i wanted was for him to listen not just give me a prescription not like I'm some kind of a canned food in a factory and him the irritated worker. It tells you alot about society who cures symptoms and not the disease itself, it tells you so much how society doesn't give a flying F to the helpless. It's like we all have to e robots and take our ""fuel"" and work the next morning without a sense of being understood and belonged."
2522,Ready to go,Over the weekend my god daughter and my father both passed now this morning the only person that gave me any little reason stopped talking to me so now I have nothing good to keep me here I feel like maybe it’s time I end it all
2523,"Found out that I have to have brain surgery, would rather die","I have a disease called trigeminal neuralgia, also called  ""the suicide disease"".  I'm only 24 and it's rarely seen in people below 50-60. There is a blood vessel that is compressing a nerve in my face and causing extreme pain. The nerve attaches to the bottom of the brain. Medicine helps but not sufficiently. I met with a neurosurgeon and he wants to set me up for a surgery called MVD where they basically put a sponge in between the nerve and blood vessel.

It's actually quite mild as far as brain surgeries go, and I'm lucky because my compression is easily seen on an MRI which greatly improves prognosis with this disease and the surgery, but I still can't deal with this. I am terrified. What if something goes wrong and I'm left with the pain/more pain, or even worse and it alters my quality of life? I don[t want someone fucking around with my BRAIN.

Suicide seems like the only option at the moment. I don't want to pick between 1. chronic extreme pain and 2. brain surgery. I'd rather just get it over with."
2524,Relapse,My grades are in the shitter now because I’ve been suicidal again. Went through a brief breakup bc my partner got scared and didn’t know how to deal with my shit. I can’t tell anyone that I’m seriously considering ending my life before 2020. So tired. I want the mental agony to end.
2525,24Years Of Shit and Terrible Pain. I'm at the end of my rope,"Context:
24F. Was horribly abused my whole childhood.  I had my arm broken twice when I was a baby.  I was forcefully given drugs by my addict mother starting when I was 5 or 7. I was molested.   I went without food.  I lived out of a motel for 3 months.   My mother would lock us in a bathroom, she would fold up a towel, place it beneath the door and then smoke cigarettes. I couldn't breath.  It was like being trapped in a prison of smoke for HOURS. I was around 7.  She was a vile vile woman. My older siblings abused me as well. I was chocked, head knocked in, amoung other nasty stuff no child should have to endure.
My other, adult siblings knew I was getting abused and turned a blind eye to it. My 30 year old sister witnessed me engaged with a sexually act with an adult.  I was around 11.  She literally watched for a moment, jaw dropped and then spoke with the person briefly about a non related topic, as if nothing were happening and then she left the room. She left me there.  
My mom was overweight and disabled.  I was the only one who really cared for her.  My back is permanently damaged from lifting her heavy ass constantly when I was a teenager. I'm the youngest.  My siblings were grown and most of the time refused to help me care for her or lift her.   
When I was 18 my mom died of cancer.  She left me some money. My siblings wanted it.  I told them that if they needed help with food, gas, diapers for their children that I would gladly help them with it but I wouldn't hand out large chucks of it. They all disowned me for it.  That was 6 years ago and they still won't speak to me.  When I was assaulted 2 years ago one of my sister's literally sent me voicemails blaming me for my assault.  
I spent my early adult years part of an awful cultlike church where I was abused verbally, and even slapped by one of the deacons for cussing. 
They also blamed me for my assault 2 years ago. 
At age 21 I dated a psycho who abused me and kidnapped me more than once, even overnight.  The cops didn't believe me.  They also didn't believe me about my assault.
I've  long battled depression/bi polar/borderline personality disorder.  I've been left by countless ""friends,"" have pretty much no family to speak of.   I've done SO MUCH to change my life. I've been in counseling for years, am on meds, I got back in school, lost a lot of weight, legally changed my name and got cosmetic work done. I moved to a new state. 
I'm still alone. I still have pretty much no one who cares about me. I've never known real love. My relationships fail. 
I'm all alone living in a new state.  All I do is work.  I took up part time stripping and was assaulted by a customer recently. I've been set over the edge.  
I'm at the end of my rope.  
I did so much to change my life. College, counseling, meds, weight loss, name change, cosmetic work. It all didn't work. I'm still alone.  
I can't go on anymore. I don't want to.  
All I wanted was love, a family of my own. I wanted to adopt children and help people. I would have been a great mother.  For 6 years I've desperately wanted marriage but I still haven't found Mr. Right. Men keep dumping me.  
I'm sick of the pain. I'm sick of being alone and feeling unloved all of the time. 
I was kind to the world and it was crule to me."
2526,My Last Goodbye,"I write this here as my last goodbye to the world maybe in the hope that it might help someone. I'm a 24 year old guy who has had more than enough of this existence.

My story starts as a child for as far as I can remember all I could feel was pain in one form or another. I was the first child and the mistake that forced my parents to stay together in a loveless marriage. Where my parents took put their anger on me. Verbally and physically. 

My average childhood day was being beaten in the morning by my parents with either coat hangers or leather belts because they had a fight together and me caressing and tending to my wounds as I sobbed and got ready in the morning. At school everyone would make fun of me for my wounds saying my parents hated me and then they used to beat me. I had no friends. Not even a single one. On the way back home I was usually either molested by the van driver or the older kids. Sometimes they beat me for fun. I would come home crying that would annoy my mom so she would beat me up again. That's when I learned to bottle up my emotions. In the 1st grade. 
When I used to go out to play no one wanted to play with me so I used to be this lonely kid and I used to get molested by random people and then I stopped going outside. 
When I told my mom why I didnt want to go outside she beat the ever living shit out of me and burned my skin with matches if I ever talked about that stuff ever again. That was the 3rd grade.
This one time some kids kidnapped me after school. Raped me in a van over and over again and threw me outside from the moving van. I walked to my house and I got beat up every day for the next 2 weeks because I got molested. I kept getting molested until the age of 14. 

As time passed I tried making friends but I didnt know how to talk to people or interact with them. What to talk about. Human emotion has always been a complex thing for me. I dont understand what to talk and when to talk. I still have trouble with that. People call me insensitive but I'm trying so hard everyday to be a better person but i just cant seem to understand. Its extremely hard to explain. So in short I had no real friends. Just people I knew. 
I found solace in being alone and I loved it. 
I craved drugs as a child because I just wanted to experience happiness. I craved them so bad and sadly that's the only way I can be happy. 

Now I had a relationship in the 11th grade but it didnt work out because I was incapable of feeling any sort of emotion. Till one day o fell for this girl put of nowhere. For no rhyme or reason I was head over heels in love with her. I didnt know how to read people or understand patterns because I lacked human contact. 

So she was a nymphomaniac and I was this dude who was extremely insecure about himself and the thought of physical intimacy scared and bought back bad memories. Needless to say she cheated on me and walked out. My whole world came crashing down on me. At this point I had tried to kill myself quite a few times. Most of the times just injuring myself really bad or just being scared to do it. 

Now the problems that plagued me were
- Never have been loved
- Wasnt good at anything 
- Trauma from years of abuse
- All my feelings since childhood bottled up
- Crippling anxiety that made me go crazy
- Depression was so bad that even popping LSD didnt exactly made me happy
- My basic memory degraded to the point where I sat in my car and I forgot how to drive. I just sat in my car for an hour because I couldn't for the life of me remember how cars functioned (I'm studying automotive engineering, still was at that moment)
- My learning and understanding capability had gone down to the point of non existence. I would read a line in a paragraph. Know what is written but I wouldn't understand it. 
- My memory was so bad i would be unable to remember almost anything. Things like where I lived or what I was doing currently. 
- The blanks as I call them were the worst. I would be functioning as a normal person. No one could tell but my consciousness and memory would disappear. This only happened when I was completely sober. I would make huge mistakes in these blank spaces and no one would believe me that i couldn't help doing what I did. 
- This gave way to extreme self hatred because usually nothing good happened in my life and when it did I was always the one who managed to fuck things up. My life on earth here was hell so far

So in July of 2017 I thought to myself that I'll enjoy this year, extremely carelessly. If I die by OD well and good otherwise I bought a gun and planned on killing myself of the strike of new year. 
This idea gave me more peace than anything ever before and I actually looked forward to it. I was actually happy thinking my death was so near. That escape was so near. 

Then during the end of 2017 I met this girl on tinder and I fell for her. HARD. And soon I had forgotten about my plan to kill myself and by March we were going out. She had her own problems too in life but while we were together literally 95% of my problems just faded away. 
My drug addiction just ended out of nowhere. I was happy on my own. I didnt need drugs. 
At the end of 2018 the blank came back again and after a drunken night out with the boys I came home. Sent nudes to this random girl and passed out. 

The next day filled me with such regret and self hatred that I wasnt sure if I should try and cover up or kill myself. She found out before I could make a decision. It was messy. We both cried so much. That night as I sat with the gun in my hand thinking where I would go to kill myself she called me and gave me another chance. 

I was never more grateful for anything in my life and the seed of self doubt that I would never be ever truly happy or for long at least and that I dont deserve happiness grew. Along with my self hatred. 

Exactly one year later the same thing happened. I was out drunk again and sexted this random chick. I wanted to kill myself for sure but I had thrown my gun away. This time for a couple of days my friend kept me sedated on valium so o wouldnt do anything stupid but after that she tried to make things work. 

This destroyed me to my very core that someone loved me so much and what I had done to her. To see her mental and physical health decline from the first time if fucked up. Someone I loved the most in the world is going through so much because of my fucked up self. And to see that happen a second time I cant even began to imagine what she went through but her trying to work things out again made me want to power through killing myself. 

But today while talking to this girl who is like a little sister to me I experienced the blank again and I shared too much of my sexual life with her to help her out and by the time my senses came back I realised what had happened. My girl saw the chat before out of instinct i deleted it. 

She says she cant trust me anymore and I dont blame her. She is in so much pain because of me. I cant bear the thought its because of me. 
She broke up with me. I cant continue hurting her like this. 
I cant be this garbage human being who brings nothing but pain and misery to those who love him and a disappointment and burden on others. I feel like a parasite, a plague on people around me. I have nothing to offer but the pain that I have been dealt with. 
I'm tired of my existence and the person I am. The person I cant seem to change and the person I seem to hate. 
She still loves me a lot and I've decided that I dont want to hurt her anymore. 
So my question is how do I kill myself that would hurt her the least?
Please don't try and talk me out of it. I'm done with life."
2527,will anyone speak to me,
2528,Can't see myself living past 20,"Currently 19F and growing up I've never seen myself live past the age of 20. I've always planned to commit suicide on my 20th birthday. I currently only have 3 friends including one friend I've made since joining university nearly 2 years ago.. but I don't really have an extremely close friend I feel like I can talk to anything about. I've struggled with social anxiety and depression since I was about 13. I had a bit of hope and had something to look forward to waking up for the first time in ages when I miraculously got my first boyfriend but he unexpectedly broke up with me through snapchat a few weeks ago saying he doesn't love me anymore and that he feels like he was forcing the relationship and was using me. I feel like the only reason I'm still alive is because I don't want to upset my parents and have my dog wonder why I never came back home. Other than that I feel like no one would really be impacted that much if I died. I find it extremely difficult to make friends and talk to people, I can't get a job and I feel like I'm just a waste of space on this earth."
2529,life sucks, To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die .
2530,Caring,"I feel like im living my life for other people and i hate it. 

If it were up to me id die. right now. but thats not possible because i care too much about the people around me.

and i dont even have that many people around me. 

my family pretty much abandoned me.

i have two friends. they do like having me around but im not a necesity.

i hate livng

its a prison my parents put onto me and i have to pretend like i want it.

and i dont"
2532,why should I keep going?,"I've been suffering with anxiety since I was a child and since last year depression's part of my life too. I tried to fight my feelings all my life but now I don't think I can keep going. 

I had to drop out of school because of my panic attacks and I don't feel comfortable talking or being around anyone. I'm seeing a therapist but I don't feel safe with her after her reaction when I told her about my sexual assault. 

My life seems so meaningless and I can't imagine a future where I'm happy and my life seem livable.

Deep down I know that I'm supposed to desire life but I'm starting to consider suicide as the best option that I've. I don't want to be a burden on my parents and friends, if I can even call them that at this point and I know that if I keep going like this I'll end up alone and without any direction in life.

I'm so scared of this thoughts but I can't not think about all of this."
2533,A choice ( WARNING: long post ahead ),"I have this newfound respect for all things dead and dying in nature.

Things I wouldn't have given a second thought before I got suicidal, like the old dusty butterfly I found in the living room, or the fallen trees at the entrance of the forest. The forest just outside of our yard, where I used to play a lot when I was younger. It's dying now, the trees are rotting and falling, one by one. Sorry, I don't really know why I'm writing all this, you don't have to keep reading.

I guess I'm feeling a bit envious, they pass so quietly. No fuss or burials, just returning to the earth. Death is the most natural process on earth, at least I feel that way. The way humans try to distance themselves from death is kind of bizarre to me. All the talk about life being a gift, the various attempts to prolong life just a bit further. No matter how much you run from death it will always catch up to you in the end. Everything dies. It's a natural process that we'll all go through sooner or later.

So what's the point? Why do we run? Why do we build things? Why do we make social connections? Why do we play music? 

Why do we live?
I'm sure that's something you've heard before, whether it was from your own head or from a book. Depending on who you ask the answer will be different. Some say we live for love and happiness, a lot of people will point to a greater being or purpose way beyond our understanding, others simply shrug their shoulders at the question. The fact that we even exist at all is kind of a miracle in of its own. The first answer seems reasonable at first, pretty much everyone will search for love and happiness to lighten  their lives. But does that mean someone who can't grasp love and happiness has no reason to live? The whole idea of some all powerful magic man in the sky is something I've never been able to understand, pretty much everything can be explained with science, and I reject the existence of any godlike being who won't prove their existence.
See? The answer just isn't clear, nobody knows. In my own opinion life is just life, and life is what you make of it. There is no greater purpose, no reason, no god. Everything is just for now.
All of us are only here for now, so let's make the best out of it, right? 

Well, it just doesn't seem to work that way. I've seen so many of you suffer and I've suffered a lot too. Some people don't have the power to change their situation on their own. In the end it's a choice. Do you live with suffering or do you die? For a whole life of suffering there is surely some happiness sprinkled between the difficult times. Maybe it's just something small, like listening to your favourite song or watching the first snow. Maybe some of you have family, friends and pets, whom you love very much. It's about deciding if it's worth to suffer for those things. If you decided to take your own life, I couldn't criticize you for that. And if you choose to live for love and happiness, I will be happy for you. I hope you'll all find peace in the end.

DISCLAIMER:
I don't intend to bash on religious people, you're welcome to believe whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.
I'm sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language.
Again. I'm sorry that this post is so messy, I don't really know what to make of all this.
I'm so sorry for this, I don't know what I was thinking."
2535,I just want to die but I can’t,"I’m crying and having a breakdown. I crying about I’ll never have a girlfriend. I just can’t do it. My anxiety and stress has taken over me. I can’t flirt, I can’t commit. There’s no trait of me woman would like. I’m 13. Everything I have and get are great. I act like I’m fine because if my parents find out, they’ll freak out and be scared what could happen to me. I currently have this new girl  friend who’ll never date me. Not a chance. I’m ugly. She lives on the other side on Australia . She really cute and funny. It’s never gonna happen. There’s no way she’ll like me. 

:(. I can’t stand be alive. But there’s no way I can go. Cutting myself will hurt too much. And it’s my only option. Hanging myself would be too much for my family. Guess I’m gonna haft to wait 5 years till I’m 18. Buy drugs then overdose. 

I FUCKING HATE MY ANXIETY. I’m that shy, quiet kid who says nothing in class. I’m always judged by what I do. Laughed at, not with. I never talk to girls I like because of my anxiety. I scared I’m gonna fuck up and embarrass myself. I done it plenty of times. I take days of school because of my anxiety. 

I’m so lonely. My friends never chat with me. They don’t give a shit about. Just took a whole week of school off and my friends haven’t said a word to me. NOT A SINGLE FUCKING WORD. They don’t give a shit about me. Not just because they haven’t texted me in a week but they complete dickheads. The only 2 I like are this girl I sit next to in most of my classes. She really my only good friend and that girl that’s on the other side of Australia. We only just met but she’s pretty cool.

I’m so lucky I have 6 weeks off starting in 2 days. 

I’m done living it’s too much. Too much work. For what. Why do I do it? I’m gonna kill myself after high school. All this effort for what? I fucking hate the state I’m in. 

At the moment I quite violent. When I get angry, I start punching things and scream at people. I’ve damaged my wrist before. I’m scared one day I’m could injure someone.

I want to tell the girl I sit next to in class. She already knows one of my big secrets. I can fully trust her. I just think she won’t give a shit about it. All she’ll say is “it’ll get better” and “it’s gonna be fine”. That ain’t gonna help will it? I might tell in my 6 week break because then I won’t have to see her until school starts again. She’ll forget it anyway.

I do nothing with my life. No hobbies at all and never go out unless I have to or if I want to. It’s my anxiety. It’s fucked me up so hard.

I’m just done. Life is to hard. So much effort has to be made to a half decent life. So why should I live. Might as well just go. Don’t give what happens after my death apart what happens to my family. If I had the chance to kill myself, I would probably take it. Write everyone letters about my choice and why. Give all my money to my parents. Then go.

If anyone actually read this, you can  go to my profile and read my other posts on this sub reddit if you want to know more about me. I’m sure no one will but yeah. I’ve stopped crying while writing this but probably going cry myself to sleep. Wake up to nothing on phone and go shitty high school. Sorry about any repeated words or about my incorrect grammar.  Goodnight."
2536,Does anyone else feel as broken and miserable as me?,"

I could not feel anymore alone than I do right now in life. I’ve been dealt a really bad card. I have no friends, never had a boyfriend and my family has done me dirty. I don’t know what I have done to make people hate me in my life, I’ve encountered drama with a lot of people, in work and school etc. I’m not hideous or mean, I take good care of myself. I’ve tried to be friendly but only end up being treated unfairly. Everyone I know has family and people that care about them, my family is filled with backstabbers and shady people that only want to gossip. I’m 25 and have no one, I felt so lonely that I ended up adopting a dog. The dog is clingy and has separation anxiety. I feel like there’s something wrong with everyone around me, not even men find me attractive. I never get attention from men, do I sound like the issue?"
2537,"I’m everything I said I wouldn't be, what if I turn out worse?","Over the course of time and through meeting people, I have realized that I am a delusional manipulative man baby. I met my friend's boyfriend about a year ago, and have realized I share traits with my friend's boyfriend who is always up to no good, always lying, and is overly possessive about his girlfriend. He goes to an extreme of lying and manipulating just to get his girlfriend to stay with him or to talk to him. Years ago, I was losing control of someone, and I ended up lying and being extra so I wouldn't lose them, but I did lose them anyways. How do I know I won't do it again? What if I stay the same? I don't want to hurt anyone anymore and I just want to end it before it gets worse. I am willing to make a change for myself to become better, but do people really change?"
2538,Kill me,"Im sitting here, in my law faculty, crying, wanting to die. I failed one test today, i have another one in 1.5 hrs - will fail that too. People who pass me - do not give a shit. My family blames this on me - you chose your career, now deal with it.
I just want to get terminal cancer, or be killed in a car accident. Or jump of a bridge. I wish guns were legal here."

Strangely enough i feel, like I'm experiencing some kind of mood swings. I go from feeling like i should've done it, to feeling like I'm about to cry haha, so weird. Aside from that my lips are tingling and feel kinda numb, yaknow? Like when you get your wishdom teeth removed and the anasthesia almost wears off."

Oh my God. Mother would be so disappointed. Fuck.

I have been looking at ways to end my life all day . 

This semester has been the worst by far. 

I am supposed to be graduating in March and if I get even a single back, I won't be able to get my degree until next year. 

Oh my God.

They don’t have to say anything..I just need them to be there to get me through those minutes.  It’s not like I’m asking them to give me hours of their time.  A few texts, a couple minutes on the phone or even a quick visit could be all it takes to get me through that day and look forward to the next.  I’ve even offered to go to their places, but that wasn’t convenient for them.  It’s not fucking hard!!!! Just do what you “OFFERED “ to do in the first place!!!! I already feel bad enough, like I’m useless, unwanted and worth nothing I don’t need my so called friends and mentors to make me feel worse!  I’m so close to my end.  I’m sitting here with the rope in my hands and I know no one will understand and wonder why?? Well this is fucking why!! I’m hurt I’m alone and I’m scared!"
2543,I think my partner is dying and I feel so helpless.,"my (F 19) partner (M 34) is currently right this second having open brain surgery for his meningitis and I just cannot cope. 
I've been unstable for weeks now before his illness began and having this lumped on top as made me feel like I can't even think. I have nobody to talk to, he's been my rock all year. 
I don't want to ask for advice because there's nothing anyone can do to help, but I need to not be this upset right now. I feel hollow and can't get my mind off my noose and barbituates just 10 minutes away at home. but I also know I need to be here in case something happens. my brain is broken and I'm not coping."

Almost every night i stay up and think about stuff that make me go fown a rebbit hole of sadness and suicidal toughts. I dont really know what to do. I dont do anything to make me happier or at least not as sad. World just dosent have color for me.

2546,My mom thinks I am worthless,"Hi. This isn't my first time in the sub, but it is the first time I post anything. My mom thinks that I am a useless child with no character and that I am dumb. And that I will never be successful in anything. My mom has this outburst usually and it fades away but recently her behaviour has increased. From when I used to be a child I used to take care of her mentally, she was unstable as far as I can remember. She is a successful doctor but with extremely low self esteem and I just can't handle her behaviour.

When I want to study or even go talk to her she always reminds me that I will never be as successful or smart as her or ever get good grades because I am dumb. I have harmed myself multiple times because I believed her. School is a way that I could escape from home because I don't see her.

She and my dad usually encourge my brother's to cure and hit me, because I am worthless but my brother's didn't give in that behaviour until recently. 

She is ruining my life and I think that there is no need for me to continue suffering with her behaviour. I have thought about multiple times to escape or run away but to where. 

She threatened me once that if I don't obey my brother's she would ""discipline"" me. And when I try to tell my problems in life and friends that avoid me she starts laughing and using that private info that I gave her against me.

I really don't know what to do or say to her. When I try to avoid her she suddenly turns into a good mother. I am stuck in a loophole and want to get out."
2547,Need help for drug abuse,"Hello everyone im kinda lost. Im 34 male from germany and i have a rare lymphoma cancer and i failed all treatments so far. Im in nonestop treatment for 2 years. I lived a good life until i got my cancer diagnose and i was happy that i archived most of my goals that i had in life. I got told first by my oncologyst that i have a good cancer that has high cure rates and i wont die by that disease. 2 years later i failed all my treatments (lots of chemos, high dose chemo with stem cell transplant, radiation, antibodys, immunotherapy). All of these treatments withhin 2 years. 4 biopsys and probably more than 20x scans. Modern oncology has no answer for me anymore. There is no working therapy out anymore for me and i have active b symtoms and i can feel that my lymphoma is progressing while im on immunotherapy. I dont even have a normal lymphoma i have a very rare special type that has almost no FDA approved drugs because studys and pharma companys dont focus on such a small subset group. This newish immunotherapy (nobel price in 2018) is only curativ for around 15% of the patients in my situation. I already know that i progressed unfortunatly but it gave me at least 6 month so far. Im thankful for that but unfortunatly the knowledge isnt enough to know how to break aquired resistance. I almost died once half a year ago after failing my stem cell transplant (high dose chemo that you can only recover from by giving you your stem cells back). My lymphoma is unfortunatly very agressiv and it grew only withhin 2 month to lead to heavy breathing issues. I got basically stroked by my lymphoma in a slow and horrible way. Than i finally got immunotherapy that worked for half a year. So to prevent myself from further disgrace and humiliation by ending in a hospice i need to end my life myself unfortunatly. Here in germany we dont have assisted dying help by doctors. Thats a damn shame in my opinion but thats another topic.. I already tried to contact these dying helping institutions in swiss but they dont offer any help for german folks. To get this sleeping drug ""numbutal"" seems to be pretty impossible either.  So my idea is to jump from a high bridge that isnt far from me. Another idea would be shooting range. I would like prefer a drug abuse though. Any ideas? It feels horrible to have no easy way to exit out."
2548,"after 7 years of depression building up, I almost ended my life. Now I'm scared of being happy","in primary school, I was one of the loudest kids ever, but all of a sudden people started asking why I went so quiet. Apparently, I had gone quiet for a full year. Now that I look back that's also around the time I started losing interest in hobbies like drawing and reading. The years went by and it only got worse. It became difficult to do anything I would go without brushing my teeth for months, I'd never shower, I skipped school whenever possible and I was hardly passing.

I slowly lost the ability to even have hobbies, I dropped out of everything but school, any hobby I picked up I got bored of a week later, my parents got me a therapist, I liked the therapist but I couldn't tell her anything serious, I struggle enough asking a friend what the time is but I couldn't tell her the deeper things. She went on to tell me I had bad depression and anxiety, I immediately forgot about that afterwards and continued to question what was happening. I just assumed I was the only problem.

Late 2018 I started to plan my death. I was going to go by train. I kept planning how and when I would do it until eventually it was done. mid-2019, I stood on the train tracks, waiting. when it finally arrived time slowed down. It felt like an eternity, but at the same time eternity wasn't near enough time to think over what I was doing, so I ended up jumping out the way. I guess a while after that I went back to just being depressed.

Now jumping from depressed to suicidal is a big jump and it's crazy overwhelming, but it also works the other way around. I felt like I was cured but I hated it, I didn't think I deserved to be happy (even though I was still very depressed and just staring at a wall was enough to trigger these thoughts at that time). I would do whatever I could whenever to force myself to be even sadder than I already was. this went on for a very long time until I eventually calmed down and realized that I had depression... yes up until then I thought nothing was wrong, even when I was standing on the train tracks waiting for death, I completely ignored my therapist and pushed everyone away.

Now we're back to the present, I no longer want to die, I just wish I never existed. I just finished every single assignment for the year in two weeks as I didn't complete anything during that time, and I just finished ghosting everyone I know because that's basically what I do all day. I've started to feel happy occasionally as my excuse for everything I've ever said and done slowly fades away and I try to convince myself I'm how sad I am to bring it back. I've noticed all these talents that I've never worked a day in my life for, I have amazing teeth and am extremely fit even though I never brush my teeth or exercise (or even walk for that matter) but I have these anyway because I'm just a selfish godlike being that has everything handed to me on a silver platter but still comes across as very below average overall. So I'm basically posting here because I know you guys can't help, I've done this a hundred times in a hundred different places and I could only do it because I know it won't affect my situation at all."
2549,Lack of money will be the reason I'll probably have to end it,"Title says it all.

Not fit enough to work a normal job, not motivated enough because the past couple of years I've worked (online/freelancing) without seeing enough back.

It sucks to not make any money and I can't do the whole 'get a job' thing. I tried multiple times and didn't suceed. I'm 'just' not good with co-workers and kissing the boss's private parts.

Not having money is going to throw me off the cliff."
2550,Does anyone else have a suicide playlist?,Like a playlist of songs they have set and ready to go to listen to as they die in case they ever do decide to end it? Was just curious if I was the only one who had done this...
2551,3 inch LOSER," I have a micropenis, 3 inches ERECT. I will never have a family. DO NOT COME ON HERE TELLING ME ITS FINE. It’s not fine, you know that and I know that. The amount of posts I’ve read where a girl loves everything about a guy but when his penis is average and she dumps him still just proves my point. I have 3 inches, I’m a fucking baby. A fucking loser. I’m not even treated like a human being. 

 I want to fucking die. I slit my hand and was taken to the ER. I look at my scar every day. It bleed so much. I abuse myself every day. I even tried to improve myself. I lost 120 lbs. girls like me a lot, but when they see what I got going on I get left in the dust every time. I’m worthless.yes, I’m good at oral, and fingering. Doesn’t matter, I’m not looked at as a man. But as a worthless loser. 

 I should have asked me pre at to do something when I was younger and able to change it. I was too scared to ask because my parents were always belittling me. I thought if I told them about my penis size, they would humiliate me because I always thought they hated me. They were always screaming when I was growing up, always moving around between them when they split up. I thought everything was my fault, maybe it is. 

 Dad always asking me if I got a girlfriend, he does it for the jokes. He doesn’t know I have a small baby penis. I work doordash and I walked into this building, two waitresses look at me and one of them literally almost shouts “wow he’s so sexy” and I didn’t do a damn thing about it. She looked very pretty but just the thought of her laughing at me after I take off my pants was too much. I wanted to pull out my pistol and shot my self right in the dick and brains as soon as I had those thoughts.

 I can’t tell any of my family or friends. I don’t want they to laugh, or pity me. I don’t want them to tell me to man up. I don’t want them to tell me that if a girl really loves me she won’t care. But the truth is they do care. Girls are smart, they things into consideration. I’m worthless, I shouldn’t have lived this many years. I’m 22 now, I’m going to kill my self soon. I just don’t want no one to find my dead body. 


I think I need to blow my self up. I don’t want to live life seeing all my friends getting married and having kids. When that was my main goal of life ever since I was a kid. That stings quite a bit. 


Please just keep this post up, I have one to talk to about this without the fear of humiliation. Every other site keeps taking down my posts. Please please just keep this up. This is my only comfort."
2552,I want to kill myself because of anexity,"Some days ago I went out with one of my friend and drunk till blackout. I only remember dancing with a girl at a club and maybe (but not sure) kissing her on the neck. I fear that I will be charged for sexual assault or I might did other innapropiate things.

My buddy says that he thinks that nothing have happened. But he was drunk too. I don't trust him.

I fight with paranoia and anxiety for years now and this situation is killing me. Usually I can releave it by talking to people about this situation but this time I can't because I can't even remember what might happened. I feel extreme guilt and fear. I haven't slept for 3 days and haven't eaten much. What should I do?"
2554,My mom doesnt understand she is fueling the fire.,
2555,chronic suicidal ideation,"When I posted on here yesterday, people asked me why I felt the way I did, and I found it a really difficult question to answer. So I spent some time thinking and researching, and I came across the notion of chronic suicidality, or chronic suicidal ideation, and I wondered if anyone else experiences the same thing?

For as long as I can remember (20+ years), my knee-jerk reaction to any misfortune is along the lines of 'I should/could kill myself'. My suicidal thoughts don't have peaks, and are rarely recognised as a crisis, because they're just always there. It's the reason I rarely contact suicide helplines, because it's not a short term crisis that I need talking out of, it's a constant way of thinking that never goes away. 

I've started to think that my latest plan to actually go ahead with it comes from this, for these reasons:

\- a thought of 'well it's going to happen eventually, so why not get it over and done with now'

\- internal mental pressure on myself to 'prove' that I really mean it

\- a sense that people must be fed up of hearing me say it for so long, and are presumably thinking 'just hurry up and do it then'

From looking up chronic suicidality, it also looks like it rarely goes away, and one has to learn to just manage/deal with it. So that adds to the desire to finally actually do it, because who wants to carry on feeling this way every day forever?

**Do you experience this too? Do you have any good coping strategies? Has it ever gone away for you? Do you wanna just talk about it with someone else who feels the same? Please messsage/comment.**

2556,Having children is a selfish act,"I think my parents were selfish for having me I would be way better off if I wasn’t born , now I have to suffer every day . I love children but I love  children so much I wouldn’t want them to suffer in this life so why have them ."

2558,"Really thought things were going well, but got a call that I didn't get the job and it's thrown me into a dark place","Recently graduated, broke up with my gf, lost a lot of uni contacts and been job searching for what feels like ages, after many rejection emails I finally got an interview - it went really well, and I was cautiously optimistic about it. Cut to today and I get a call saying, yeah the interview did go really well, however I had lost out to another candidate, making me a close second place (perhaps they say this to everyone to lessen the blow idk). Either way, it sucks. I feel like a failure and without a great deal of hope for the future, and not sure it's worth going through rejection after rejection ad infinum, don't have a lot going on outside of job searching atm, and don't have a lot going for me in general - it doesn't feel like I ever will.

So there's my self-indulgent rant, TL;DR: didn't get the job, feeling like kermitting rn."
2559,Change in tempo,"She rested her head against my chest and told me she could hear my heart beat. And she listened for hours.

She's gone now, did she not like what she heard? My whole life in those beats thump thump thump. She heard it. And left.

She went and found a new tempo now.

Laying here trying to sleep and all I can hear in my ear resting on the pillow is the tempo. The one she heard in its entirety and decided to throw away. I'm thinking of changing it now, maybe slowing it all the way down. Maybe then I won't be able to hear it and we can all go to sleep."

And I just have so much hanging over me right now I can't cope, and I feel like I'm achieving nothing and going nowhere after graduating last year, and I can't get over my ex even though we split up over a year ago, and everything just keeps adding up and I'm struggling.

And I have to be awake in 5 hours to go to work and it's taking a lot of effort not to drive straight into a tree and I don't know what I want from this post I just need to tell someone this because I don't have anyone else to tell that would care"

sometimes i think that people have problems too but they're just really good at hiding it. i find it difficult to smile or find a reason stay positive. every day goes by without any improvement, each day just wasted. i hate the people around me. i wish i could find a better job. what am i going to do?"
2562,My brain scares me,"My brain scares me. It feels like a deep pit of despair that opens up at the most random times. It swallows me whole and drowns me in it's dark, oily thoughts then spits me out cold and shivering, not knowing when It will open its jaws again.

Because of this, sometimes I wonder if suicide is really all that bad of a thing. It scares me, because I'm not afraid of death, of killing myself. I've become almost numb to the world around me because it never takes the time to acknowledge me, so why should I recognise anything going on in it? Wow, that made my stomach knot a bit, haha...

Something else I find scary is that I actually held a knife up to my neck the other day. A long, sharp one to. It would have been so easy, a flick of the wrist from left to right. But I just held it there, hard enough to know it was there but not enough to draw any blood or leave a mark. Instead of shaking or becoming panicked like I've heard other people say when they've gone to end it all, I felt excited, I felt this burst of adrenaline that made  my body tingle and my heart pound. My head was screaming at me, not to stop, but to go harder, to draw blood.... I have never put a knife away so quickly before. I got a rush of adrenaline typing this that makes me want to do it again.

I have cut myself before, and it's addicting, hard to stop doing. So that whole neck thing must have been my brain getting hooked again. I hate it, but it brings me comfort. It's something to tie me to reality, keep me grounded, in a strange way I guess.

I really thought I’d be more scared writing this then I am, I've never confessed something like this before. I just feel, hollow and empty. Aha, it’s so strange… the one time I don’t feel anything is the time that I really should. Everything’s just, hazy, static-like, like I'm not really here at all. I'm just a body going through the motions really, my insides have been rotting for a long time and I'm actually surprised I haven't  just dropped dead yet."

2564,I had the most interesting dream.,"The dream part doesn't matter much but let's just say I didn't want to become a drug dealer and begged for the dealer to kill me. She obliged with a bullet directly to my skull. And it felt pretty bad. There was this crazy ringing/buzzing for a weirdly long time after, and then I woke up. 

My head actually felt like there was a bullet rattling around inside there, and I felt nauseous for a minute. Still kinda shaky. Bit like coming out of a seizure, but not quite.  
I'm not confused, just sad. 

Just sad that it wasn't real. I really felt like dying in that moment and didn't get the peace I wanted after asking. Just woke up in my bed alone staring at the same ceiling, depressed. I share a lot of the same guilt many of you carry after making an attempt, being told I'm selfish and required to exist for others. I just want to die on my terms and make it not look like my fault. 

I don't know what else to say beyond the normal rhetoric posted in every post here, but don't worry about me, I am still forcefully existing/not attempting anything right now.
Just had to write this down somewhere."
2565,Death is a friend,"Having one of those moments where I had realized I can fight suicidal thoughts and be happy. Started off this year with registering to do a post graduate course. I was passing and failing but that was the juice of life, I convinced myself. I have had more than 6 years of weekly suicidal thoughts so I knew how pessimism can be so I was still fighting.

Around Oct I was diagnosed with a fatal disease. I thought to myself ""wow, maybe I truly need to die.."" but I wanted to fight first. I thought maybe all these things happening are paving a way for this post grad to come to fruition.
I worked for it and I was constantly scared of what might happen as soon as it doesn't work out as every odd has proven that"" things don't get better""

I received my results today and unfortunately I did not make it. Apart from the fact that this has given a good green light for the suicide but I am in disbelief. How can God be so silent. How can the universe be so unkind. 
Not only am I finishing a glass of wine, didn't go to work, staring at 45 pills in front of me but I am also calmly thinking a about it all. 
One of the most terrifying cognitive dissonance is learning that there's what we call optimism and all the dynamics of it are not applicable in my own life even though they are meant for me. 

This probably will serve as a suicide note, but I have got a couple ones in my diary. It feels like I'm about to go on a journey as I am about to drink these pills. It feels like a new hope to find the truth. Whatever and wherever it is, I hope it bring me redemption"

2567,Quittin time,"It feels unnatural to stay around at this point. 

If I were to describe it, it's like if oil was mixed with water for a while. The whole time its intentions were clear. Steadily they separated and resistance to the separation was the pains I felt along the way and stress in keeping everything stable. But now it feels completely different. The oil and water have finally reached their natural resting points and it doesn't make any sense anymore, there's no more separation to resist. They're separated.

I already lost, and trying to stick around is fighting a lost war. Ultimately, anyone who ""knows"" me (that means none of the helpful people who may claim otherwise but are strangers) has abandoned me. Anyone who had the chance to look at who I am and evaluated the whole picture decided to split. It's inevitable with time. Like oil and water.

Alone cold tired maybe calm driven and ready to go. Not sure."

2570,Ending tonight,"Hello,

I have thought about suiciding for a long time. I'm going to end it tonight. The only thing that kept me going was my mom. I'm still alive because of her.

But everything is just too much. The only thing I think about is suicide. Everyone left me. The friends I had left me as soon as they could.

I had two dreams in the past few weeks, about how I can be happy. 

Dream 1: I was in the hospital and she sad I had five minutes to live. I felt so happy and free. It was finally over.

Dream 2: I had friends and even a girlfriend. I was happy. So yesterday I thought let's go for dream 2, but now I realised that's never going to happen.

Goodbye everyone, 

Sorry mom."
2571,ramble,"I will die, I will die. I hear a train driving Past my dorm room right now. 

That’s how I initially wanted to go, but then I actually went out there to jump in front of it one night , and found that I was too much of a pussy to actually do it. And I hear that train go by 5 times a day and it blows its horn everytime . 

I honestly feel like it’s mocking me for not going through with it.
That was the night I got committed to the hospital. Not fucking doing that again, nope nope nope, so much money, wasted, fucking gone. They said my insurance would cover it, nope. Fuck you. 
I missed a whole week of school and failed, so now my problems were worse than before. 

I’m actually glad tho, I study and study to keep going forward because for some reason I feel so attached to this earth. And now that school is shot to hell for me thanks to the hospital, I don’t have that to hide behind either.

Everything’s out in the open and ready to be finished. 

Now it’s a building. A really high building to just fall. I already went on top of a parking structure this week, and I’m pissed to all fucking hell to find myself scared again. However, I was very cold and extremely sober, something I will fix next time. 
I was also on the phone with my friend who wants me to stay alive and shit youuuuuuuuu fucking asshole. No, no I won’t. Not for you, you mean nothing to me. You aren’t him, and you never will be. I don’t owe shit to you to stay alive so stop fucking guilting me into staying alive. I’m not your problem and I never will be. 

I will wait for winter break. When I go back to Portland, I wanted to do it here, but now I’m thinking portland is better. I can sit in my warm car and get completely plastered, take all my trazodone and lexapro, and then once I’m nice and mind fucked to hell, I can close my eyes and take a running leap to that motherfucker. 

I love you jin nnnnnnnnnn and I always will. I’m sorry I wasn’t good enough for you, but you deserve thisssssssssssssssss.,,!,!;&amp;/@-@:;!;!.!/! you shouldn’t have left me, you shouldn’t have talked to me in the first place, I bet you’re wishing you hadn’t hahahahaha haha, this will all be on you, it will be your fault and I have no FUCKS TO GIVE if you think otherwise. 

I’M INSANE, I DOKT CARE, I KNOW my mind is not sound anymore, I have come to terms with it. it hurts too much to not call it love because then what am I doing this for. Nope it hurts hurts hurts hurts, can’t call it anything else, so therefore I love you. I know that at least at some people I truly did love you and I just hope to god I’m still holding onto that. I know now you never did. 

You said I was a part of your family, while knowing I’ve never had one. You knew what you were doing, you set me up for failure. You knew I’d fall apart, you knew I would fall into your hands. I feel nothing, I am nothing. I hate you I love you, you are my everything."
2572,I have enough prescription pills to od by my bedside for a month but I havent done it... does this mean I’m not suicidal,
2573,Got sent home for 2 weeks while being inpatient,"I've been inpatient in a psychotherapeutic clinic for nearly 5 months. They decided to send me home on a 2 week time out. They said it's because I sleep too much, don't attend every therapy and can't find connection with the group of patients. Aren't these all obvious signs of depression and anxiety, and even more the reason for me to need help? I'm nearing the end of the 2 weeks and tensions have been building up so much. They sent me home without any supervision. Last week I was home ALONE for an entire week (which they knew). I'm so mad at my team of doctors and nurses for doing this to me. Suicidal thoughts are creeping in more and more. I don't even know if I want to go back purely because I feel like I can't trust my team anymore. I feel like no one understands me."

2575,Don't cry,"*Don't cry* deep breath, don't let the weakness leak out of your eyes cause you may very well drown this time, and you don't really want to hear the sound of breaking again.

Take a shower, get ready for work, put on some make up, the mask has to hold, *everything is gonna be ok*, work, just take a step after a strained step, the day is a mountain you just have to reach the top.

And then tommorow is the same, rinse and repeat hoping the water doesn't fill your lungs. Don't stop moving, do 10 things at once to occupy your brain. You still have a lifetime of climbing to do...alone.

*Don't cry*."
2576,25/12/19,My final date
2577,Suicide for me soon,"I've been distressed by the same incident in 2015 - that it caused me disturbance in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and seems to keep going in 2020

When I was 19, I made a confessions blog. Everyone used it to write in anonymous insults about each other. People found out it was me then started targeting me. Then everyone shortly moved on.

It has been almost 5 years and it still affects me all day every day. It often disturbs my ability to sleep. 

I wish I could move on. I'm getting EMDR but I'm not convinced I'm ever going to be able to move on.

It is all I think about all day every day and I experience strong emotions.

I'm 24. Petty drama at 19 shouldn't have such a strong hold on me still

I'm aspergers

People on the spectrum have:
- high unemployed rates
- high suicide rates
- low rates of marriage

I dropped university, I'm an incel who can't get a girl, I'm autistic, I peaked in high school, I have unhealthy obsessions with incidents from almost 5 years ago and I think about my teenage years every day.

Im truly defeated, all round frustrated, and ready to leave life"
2578,I just cut myself,"I've held knives before, ran them across my skin and scratched myself before. I've never drawn blood before, never left a scar. It's been like that on and off for four years.

Today, my heart hurt a little more. I feel like a failure, going nowhere. I don't see a clear path ahead of me. I do see fear, all my insecurities laid out before me, all my shortcomings. More than fear, I feel hate. I hate myself. I hate myself so much.

I cut myself. I don't want to go into to much detail, I don't want to encourage others. I don't want others to want what I want. I feel like I've been more depressed before, more out of control, but somehow the state I'm in now is so much more dangerous. I'm not just erratic and panicked, looking for a way out, I'm fueled by hate too. 

Thing is, I understand there's help, I understand I can do things about my problems... but I block those thoughts. Hell, in the past I've had a lot of success with both but I don't care. they're distractions from my goal."
2579,I keep reading that Xanax and alcohol are deadly but people on here say it’s not.,"I’ve got 7mg of Xanax and two bottles of wine. 

I thought this was the peaceful way to go. I’ve had Xanax and strong pain killers for surgery and I remember my breathing was very shallow. So how do people survive Xanax and alcohol?"
2580,Times up,"i said i would wait a couple weeks before doing it to see if i still felt the same way and i do and it’s only gotten worse. i said if it wasn’t better by now then i’m doing it, so i guess i have to.."
2581,Thought I might die last night but I didn't. Kind of half assedly attempted? Didn't really expect it to work and just did it impulsively but thought hey maybe,"Last night I took a bunch of benadryl and drank a bunch. Lemme just say it was not a good time, but I think I fell asleep before most of it happened. Obviously I didn't die and what I did was never likely to kill me anyway. But it makes me realize I'm dangerous to myself right now, but I still refuse the hospital. I guess I just try not to be alone."
2582,I think tomorrow’s the day I give up and I’m at peace with it,Planning everything out just makes all the panic go away and after a few horrible years or constant pain it just feels like the perfect time. I’ve tried very hard and I’m not ashamed to be giving up. This isn’t a call for help this is me saying I might finally be okay with it
2583,"Not in danger, but recollecting my past til now.","For the past 5 years of my life (when I started college), until just few months ago, I couldn't see myself graduating. I only ever thought that I would kill myself before that happened, and yes I've had my moments and have stood on the edge, close to doing myself in. However, I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't; I'm happy to be where I am - alive and well.

Anyway, as I am to graduate at the end of this week, I have been thinking a lot about the past, especially about my previous desire to end it all. During this reflection, I get this odd feeling/emotion that is incredibly hard to describe; it's almost a sense of not belonging. It's not like the feeling one might get when at a party they weren't invited to and knows nobody there; it's not like a physical misplacement. What I've been experiencing is close to something like an existential feeling; it feels like my ""essence"" or ""soul"" (not to say I believe in internal energies like that) just isn't where it's supposed to be. I'm not gonna say I'm supposed to be dead right now because screw that; I like where I'm at. In all though, it's rather overwhelming and something I never imagined would be a thing, but it is.

In all reassurance: I'm not tempted to do anything, and I try my best every day to stay above any negative thoughts; I do that successfully. Although, I thought this would be an interesting thing to share since I think it's a unique experience. That's all."
2584,im crying so hard,WHY WONT ANYONE HELP ME????
2585,Suffocating by the weight of it all,"I just wish I knew where to even start.  I’m severely in debt, going through a divorce, can’t afford Christmas for my kids, clinically depressed, and I actively hemorrhage money every time I have to drive to work because it’s so far away and I make so little.  Daycare costs me thousands a year for the couple weeks I get to see my kids a month which is amazing except I can’t do anything for them because I have no money.  I can’t even do Christmas this year because my paycheck was messed up.

My wife of 10 years left me and between bills, rent, and expenses, I can’t afford to continue on this way.  Hell, I can’t even afford to get divorced.  I want to move cross-country to stay with my mom (if she’ll let me), but I can’t afford to do that and, even if I could, I don’t want to leave my kids.  Instead, I’m stuck in a place that I don’t know, have no support group whatsoever at, and I just keep thinking off and on if ending it will make it all better.  Answer?  No, it won’t, but it feels like that.  I know all it’ll serve to do is make my kids sad and leave them without a dad, but do they really even have one now when I feel like an empty husk of a person all the time?

I’m in therapy at the VA but I’ve exhausted every possible resource they’ve given me and none have panned out.  They only have so much to give and so many need help that I just get shuffled into another line or cluster of faces that I’m sure no one would even notice if one of those faces disappeared.  My therapist is amazing but I just feel so empty after our sessions because I know I’m just going back to the same problems, the same bullshit, the same everything that just serves to crush me under all the weight.

I have work in two hours and I’ve been lying awake just wanting to quit because I can’t afford a tank of gas to get there.  I’ve exhausted resources from fellow Redditors and tapped my friends for money to the point where they don’t talk to me anymore.  Rent and utilities take my whole cash flow for the month and childcare takes the rest.  I just can’t and honestly don’t want to anymore."
2586,An interesting title,"I made my will today. Im 19. Nobody knows I exist. I moved four hours away from home when I turned 18 and don't know one person from the two years Ive been here. I am not lying or exaggerating when I say I don't or haven't had one friend the whole time. Not one. How does someone go a whole two years without inviting someone into the apartment? Without a text? Snapchat? I did it. Im invisible. I'll continue slipping through the cracks. What can we do other than look for attention on Reddit. I'll probably delete this too out of fear of others' judgement. My invisibility feels like a shield, I wont be in the center of anyones joke this way but everyone needs to feel heard. Dont private message me please."
2587,I cant go on,"Was thinking of taking a ton of seroquel, clonazepam and then just staying in really cold water in winter until i pass out. Will that work?
I'm 47, depressed my whole life, i have a kid and my husband is divorcing me, but wont let me go back to my home country, basically just wants to keep me around as a cheap babysitter because his free time and hanging out with his friends is more important than his kid. I know it might destroy my kid but i really think she would be better off without me. I have no job prospects as i havent had a job in 10 years and am getting too old. I just cant do this on my own anymore. I dont want to be talked out of it, i'm just wondering if my method will work. Thanks for reading."
2588,Friday the 13th,"As of now, my plan is to kill myself this Friday. Killing yourself on Friday the 13th is cliche, I know.

The plan is to kill myself with my lamictal. Killing yourself with is this awful and painful, I know.

I don't know if I'm going to go through with it. Should I just do it? Should I check myself into the emergency room that day?

I've never had such a serious plan before. I haven't told my loved ones that my plan is so tangible, and every other time I have told them. It feels like I'm more serious about it this time. I'm posting something here so maybe I'm not completely gone.

If I go through with it, and I'm not around to make another post, then I just want to say goodbye and thank you to everyone."
2589,I'm never getting out of here,"I've been living in a rent subsidized apartment for 6 years on account of being unable to maintain FT employment due to severe depression. My neighbors are atrocious, loud and ignorant AF. My neighbor above me OD'd and I'm actually jealous of her. I wonder if she went peacefully and if she did it on purpose. I turned 30 last month. I feel like I'm never going to be able to leave this place. I think I'm going to die here just like she did."
2590,PTSD?,"I think I have ptsd, I’m an idiot and a horrible person who only hurts and burdens the people around me. I’m too vague, too confusing, too damaged to be worth anything. I hate myself, and I don’t want to admit there is anything wrong with me but I’ve been self harming since I was in 3rd grade. Everyone abandons me, even my mom and sister are close to calling the police on me. I’ve been to treatment twice, suicide attempts hurt my family and give me no control over my life. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore and I’m really afraid of dying!! I can’t keep living like this. I just turned 20."
2591,a good suicide attempt?,"if I take 400mg seroquel(no tolerance) and a bunch of other pills, will it be effective? will I just fall asleep and die?"
2592,Anyone thinks their suicide might lead in the death of their loved ones?,I think my mother will probably die (suicide or other cause) but I can’t live in unfixable miserable condition. I don’t know what will happen after death but whatever it’s I hope I won’t see what will happen in this cruel world.
2593,Trigger warning: my dream,"Tonight I had a dream about suicide.
I don't remember much about it, and I wouldn't have remembered any of it if my dry mouth hadn't waken me up.

In my dream I was in bed.
A combat knife was sticking out of my abdomen, right below the lowest rib on the left.
My clothes and bedsheets (in a certain radius around the wound) were soaked in blood.
There was a big puddle of blood on the floor too.
For those wondering: I didn't feel any pain.

My alarm clock (wich is just a regular alarm clock in real life) in my dream checked for my vitals and decided to call my parents and friends and some medics as well. It started counting down to do it.
I didn't want anyone to come so I frantically pushed the buttons on it to stop that function.

I guess I pushed buttons in real life too because when I woke up the alarm function was on (I hadn't turned it on yesterday evening).

It's not the first time I find the alarm on in the morning, but it's the first time I have a suicidal dream that feels this real and remember about it.

I just needed to get this out, if anyone read it thank you."
2594,last resort,"it has been a very hard year for me. so many things have fallen apart and.. i just am not a person designed to live i think. life just wasnt really meant to happen for me. i shouldn’t have been born. ive been telling myself itll get better ever since i was a fucking kid. it just doesnt get better. 

ive attempted suicide three times in the last year, my most recent this june. i never expected to make it to 18 -let alone 20. i hang out with friends, i work, i eat.... and i just. sleep. i dont shower for days. i lay in bed. i ignore text messages and calls. i lash out at my mother for everything and i think i have ruined our relationship. i dont deserve to be alive, and i dont want to be. ive felt nothing but miserable. 

the only reason ive made this post is because im desperate now. i have a therapy appointment on friday but ive not seen my therapist in months and i dont know how to catch her up on everything and explain my problems when i dont how to. theres nothing she can do at this point and honestly im just. idk. looking for a sign its not time yet."
2595,I want to kill myself for being a failure,"Today is the 4th year i think about suicide daily. I Wake up each morning and think about how big of a failure i’am and i just want to slit my wrists. 4 years ago i slept with a girl whom is very ugly and fat and it just makes me sick to my stomach. 

I am completly baffled about how i did not see what i was doing 4 years ago when i made the misstake while being drunk and i have not forgiven myself ever since. You may think i’m being silly but that my dear readers is not the case. 

Imagine my positions as this following example; imagine having eaten the most delicious Foods all your life and then suddenly you hear a loud crack in your mouth and spit it out and notice it is a cookaroach that has made it into your meal and suddenly you are completly disgusted and ashamed and flabbergasted about how uncasious you have Been. 

After the Night i was with her i got put on suicide watch after having attempted to jump of a bridge. The look of her still haunt me today. Imagine big layers of fat and cellulites and stretchmarks and breast that hang like an deflated tire and the most disgusting face god decided to put on earth.

What then happend after the evening was that she started to Write to me Every Single day and tell me how much she likes me and then i told her that i was not interested as politely as i could but she refused to give up and continioued to write and it got to a such point that she started waiting outside of my appartment building. 

3 months later i had enough since the police could do nothing about it and i hated being reminded of seeing that disgusting bitch everyday so i started bullying her and eventuelly she started cutting her wrists and sending pictures of it to me. 

Then came the breaking point where i wrote her a 2 page letter about how disgusting she is and how she should just end her life. Suddenly after a week i notice that the messages have stopped and i did not see her anymore. 2 weeks went by and i hear from a friend that she had hanged herself with a belt and the police found the corpse after people had complained about a foul stench coming from the room.

Now i do not Care if she is dead the problem is that my head is hurting from the memories i have from her. I have had 2 overdoses and i’m constantly abusing alcohol and substances to forget the memories of her but its like they are written in Stone. 

And i can’t speak to any psychologist due to lack of funds and my friends are hard Drug abusers so i don’t have a close relationship to them due to them being fiends and i don’t trust them."
2596,tired of trying for a dumpster 🔥,"I have had two suicide attempts in the past. I failed both times because I caved and told my fiancé those were a little more spontaneous. I have a plan this time. I’m not really writing for help. I’m more or so just writing to get this feeling out of me. I have a plan for New Years. It makes sense and it will make sense to the people I love. I have written letters to everyone important to me and one with my last wishes and sealed them all in envelopes. New Years last year I was violently raped, so it figures I wouldn’t react well to this New Years. That isn’t the main reason I’m doing this though. I feel I just keep trying and failing at everything. I have worked four temporary jobs in the last year and not one of them hired me on, but none of them had a negative thing to say about my work. My fiancé resents me because my sex drive is shitty and my sex drive is shitty because one I have zero self confidence and two because I resent him for not working and being a video game addict but I can’t tell him that because he’s sensitive and it will crush what little self confidence he has. I also have tried to loose weight and I can’t it’s fucking impossible. I eat 650 calories a day, mainly veggies, fruits and nuts. I only drink water and milk. I run two miles everyday. I lost 20 pounds and it’s been 3 months and I haven’t lost a single pound since. I’m behind on rent, phone, electric, and water. I’m about to loose my health insurance again which means I’ll loose access to my therapist and my bipolar medication. So the feelings I’m having right now will only intensify. I’m just really really fucking tired of trying so hard to keep my shit together and pay my bills, and keep my fiancé happy, and pretend to be happy for my friends and family, and go to jobs and improve companies I’m not getting hired at or paid well at. I’m tired of trying to loose weight, be healthy, work, pay bills, socialize, love, feel, talk, fucking all of it. I just try so hard all the fucking time and never get a god damn break not one in the last six fucking years.   
Honestly the world is a giant hellfire anyways our president is an idiot, our government is corrupt, our media is sickening, people are generally bad, the earth is dying and no one cares. So yea I just don’t wanna try and honestly I don’t wanna be apart of this fucking dumpster fire anymore. 


Alright that’s it. Thanks for coming to my fucked up ted talk."
2597,I can't fucking finish,"I hate myself. Among a different number of things, the cherry on my cake is that I can't reach orgasm. I never have in my life and probably never will.

Masturbating feels like nothing at all, no matter how genuinely turned on I am. I'm 19.. who the fuck has this issue at 19. I'm extremely ashamed of it and god if I hear one more person say it's common or normal I'll just have a seizure.. I DON'T CARE if it's common or normal please stop

I tried to gather every tiny bit of courage I had to mention this to my therapist, in a language that I'm really bad at, she just ignored it. I even got to read the report she wrote about me and it's not even mentioned.. even the fact I feel like dying often isn't mentioned, and it had a couple of small wrong thing she either misunderstood or I just suck at talking her language.

I understand this is possibly the shittiest reason to feel suicidal. It's not the only reason but I'm still ashamed of it, no one understands how this feels and no one seems to care at all, even my therapist.

I don't know what to do with myself I've always just wanted to die no matter what I do, even with all the people around me I sometimes feel extremely alone. if my therapist isn't interested in what i say and doesn't pay attention to me then who the hell would? my general doctor too doesn't seem to care.

i want someone to pay attention to what i say and help me
I'll try to go to sleep now, goodnight reddit"
2598,I'm Going to Cure Your Depression and Suicide with One Post,"Look. Don't fuckin' kill yourself. OK? You're not thinking straight. If you really were intent on dying, like say, someone in a hostage situation, in a dungeon, being tortured for whatever reason, and you knew killing yourself is the best of all options, you wouldn't think, you'd just do it. The hesitation is ✨ a Gift.

Have any good Suicide Songs? Like [Insane Clown Posse - Suicide Hotline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23-k9-LJkw)?

Think about this: if you're going to be dead in X many minutes because fuck everything, who cares . . . realize how liberating that is!! If you truly don't care if you're alive or dead . . . you're free to paint yourself up like a clown and go naked into a grave yard with a shovel and masturbate while people look at you like you're crazy. You're not crazy. You just don't give a shit anymore. The orgasm you'll have will be the best of your life. It may not fix the problems leading you to commit suicide, but at least this way no one will know if you're comin' or goin'!! 8==========D"
2599,"So, it’s time. A final advise stroll.","Hey guys. It’s come. The day I decided I’m bored of being here. 

This isn’t a post trying to get your help on getting through on living, I’m here looking for advise on how to deal with the deed. 

I’m bored of my existence of what I feel, petty anxiety and depression. I lost my job. I’ve been denied several jobs because I’m am a toxic person to be around and fear too much to go into customers Service-type jobs. I don’t want to financially rely on my parents for the rest of my being and before my lease is up, I plan to take my life. 

I’m not sad about it. I’ve come to my understanding of what death is and what it means. 

So I guess I’m here, asking you fellas, how can I do this w/o making my family know I’m dead. I’ve talked to my brother about taking off and leading on a new. I’d like to take that approach. What’s a resource that I can use to make it as easy, clean, and painless as possible. Is there someone I can go to for help? A private company perhaps, or a person willing. I doubt it. If you have anything you have to share, please do."
2601,"I can’t do that to them, but I can’t do this to myself either","I have no idea why I still come to this sub. Nothing any of you say is going to change my mind. Sure, I might sit here and take what you have to say into account, but at the end of the day my decision is my own. 

Now that that’s out of the way.

For as long as I can remember in recent memory, I haven’t been able to feel anything. I just sit around doing x or y or z and I don’t feel like it’s getting me anywhere. I have great friends, a great family, great pets, a great school, decent professors, the whole nine.

I’m your standard fairly intelligent fairly athletic fairly attractive white guy. 

Basically, I have everything going for me, and I’ve still felt like this for forever.

Then I met this girl. Classic 3 weeks into freshman year of college started dating. I fell for her. And now I’m wondering if it’s all a lie. She’s from New Hampshire and I’m from New York and she cut it off since she went to go back to school in NH. 

She made me feel. She made me feel like I could do something for someone. We spent so much time together that I honestly felt like we were going to be perfect forever. I love her.

She fucked another dude and cut it off, and she’s still all that goes through my mind after months of trying to get over her. Months of trying to tell myself someone else, months of telling myself that I shouldn’t feel like this. 

But here I am.

Just when I thought I was two steps forward I’m six steps back.

And now I feel worse off than when I started.

How am I supposed to justify shit to my parents? Making my mother cry would haunt me. Leaving my brothers do deal with their own shit would kill me. I can’t do that to them, but I can’t do this to myself either. So I’m stuck in limbo until I do something stupid.

I spend so much of my time telling myself that nah she ain’t worth it. I spend so much of my time trying to help other people out and make sure they’re okay so that maybe I can do something nice with my life. So that maybe I can distract myself from the underlying problem that is me.

I don’t know what in the actual fuck I’m supposed to tell myself every morning.

“Bro it’s just a girl, get over her man, she’s not into you”

Like boom problem solved right?

I normally confront all of my problems head on and get over them, but I have no idea where to go forward from here. Just this morning I was feeling okay and dming other people helping them out and seeing how they’re doing, now I’m like this.

I’ll feel so fucking great for a while, on top of the fucking world ready to do well and catch the fucking moon, stars, and everything in between.

The next thing I know I slip into this absolute fucking desolate wasteland at the forefront of my mind that consumes me until I become a different person.

I have to weigh every decision carefully because if I don’t I’ll do something that I’ll regret. Im extremely compulsive, but I can’t be because if I succumbed to every little thing then I wouldn’t be here writing this post right now.

Sorry it’s longish. Just needed somewhere to write and say fuck it.

Tl;dr Don’t give no hoes your already broken heart, don’t let them control your mind, and fix yaself before you try to do that so you don’t end up being a numb fuck like me. Live the life I wish I could.

And last but not least. Fuck you all for knowing these things about me. That’s all"
2602,I guess you can say I’m not tough enough to live through this,
2603,I’m in danger and I feel like I need to act on it.,"I feel like I can’t avoid doing some harm to myself and the only way I can get the relief that will help me is through suicide. Nothing else will do at this point. It’s a burning feeling inside me and I can’t avoid it anymore. I want to take every bit of hate out on myself and just get rid of how I’m feeling for good I don’t care how anymore.

A timer of how often you can post here is gonna get people like me killed. I can’t take this anymore I am in distress right now and this is what I get"
2604,The true pain of my existence,"I don't know why I've chosen to post here. Perhaps I seek to fit in somewhere, perhaps I seek to reveal the part of me I show to no one in real life. 

In real life, I'm energetic, happy, funny. My family would never suspect a thing. But deep down I don't care. I care for nothing and no one. 

I feel nothing. I wish I felt something, anything but this unbearing unrelenting sadness. I don't feel like doing anything anymore. I just want to sleep, I don't want to exist anymore. There is no one on this planet that loves me, or who I love. I love no one, and no one loves me. Not even my family. I'm a failure. I'm not normal...I'm very introverted and I've never had friends. I've lived this life for years but kept telling myself to keep going. Nothing has changed, and I certainly don't expect it to. I'm a burden to everyone because I'm useless in life. The pain, I just want it all to stop."
2605,I feel out of place,"I'm in high school,

I immigrated to the US at the age of 6, I've lived in poverty for most of my life, in my good fortune, I was accepted to a 'selective' public school in my city 3 years ago.

I hate it here, I have never felt more alone, poor, and ashamed. I am ashamed when I wear the same pair of clothes to school every other day. When I have to tell my Track and Field coach that I have to delay my fee payments again because I'm still struggling to work for them. When I am invited by my 'friends' to shopping centers and I just stand around outside the stores not understanding what they are talking about or buying. I am ashamed whenever someone insults my English, whenever someone makes snide remarks about how they thought my mom cut my hair. Because they say that for fun, but I know they are right. I know I am more fortunate than most, that I am not like my family members back home in Romania, struggling to get by in a government that is failing and an unfair and corrupt economy, or of the other less fortunate people in my city who sometimes get shot just when walking to school. But it feels unfair for me to be surrounded by sons and daughters of lawyers, CEOs, and doctors when my dad is a part-time labourer and my mom just got a full time job a couple years ago.

I have always been an overachiever, when I was young, I dreamed of doing good, yes, but in style. After all, artemis fowl didn't just save the world, he also was comfortable, rich. I've always strived to reach that point. But so many people are just ahead of me, if I really do 'overachieve', if I get into an elite college like I have been working towards for the past 3 years, what'll happen then? Will I feel even more out of place? What would happen after, would I become successful and become a parent to the same children that make kids like me feel terrible about ourselves? What is the point, I've worked so hard, I haven't had a happy childhood, I haven't had a good high school experience, and I probably will have a hopeless and cold life too.

The only thing stopping me from killing myself is my parents, it would destroy them. I'm their only child and they have worked so hard for me, they sacrificed everything in Romania to bring me here so I'd have the opportunity to have a better life. But I can't bring myself to let them know they failed, I love them so, so much, I don't want them to feel pain on my account. I don't know what to do, I feel like if I live out the rest of my life I will be miserable, but I don't want to hurt the ones closest to me, I don't want to become another statistic, and I don't want to become the kid on the bench in my high school's atrium. I don't know what to do, I feel like I have had my childhood robbed away from me and I just want to start over.

Thank you for listening."
2606,Hi,I don’t what this is. I just started thinking about how I failed to kill myself a year ago. I wish I did so I didn’t have to hear my mother talk about how she wishes she could leave my brother and I since we’re both struggling. Idk. I think she’d be happier if I was dead.
2607,I just really need to give up. I can’t fix myself,Severe agoraphobia has been keeping me almost completely limited to my bed. I keep my windows covered so almost no light gets in and I use sleep aid to get through the day. I’m tired of endless panic attacks and a feeling where I need to hurt myself. I can’t get better and the anxiety and depression has become too much for me and I know I’m not getting out of this. I made a throwaway for help but I feel like In the next couple of weeks I’ll give up completely. I can’t do anything and I just want it to all be okay
2608,"Whats the point in living,,,,,,,",i just wanna give and receive love but apparently the world dose not fucking work like that for me everything thing is so difficult and i just wanna stop existing my family dose not care about me i dont have any true friends i just have myself all alone and i have to live through through shit for god knows how long not only that im VERY young (early teens) so i have to live even longer
2609,I'm done.,"Anyone who ""misses"" me will forget or at least not care within a year. I know for a fact my own family wouldn't care, they would feel relived. I've struggled all my life with mental illness and now that I finally got on the proper meds, my family seems to hate me even more. There is zero hope for me. Some of us are meant to be outlived."
2610,I actually want to do it,Can someone help me actually commit suicide... like I've made up my mind and it should be my decision i dont know why the world is so against it. If I dont wanna be here anymore that is my own prerogative. I need information on how I can do this asap like as fast as I can I'm 18 but i cant buy ammunition
2611,I just want to cease to exist,The person i love the most. The person i love more than life is dating my best friend. My best friend knew my feelings but decided to just go with the flow and started a relationship with her. It hurts. I feel so empty. My chest constantly hurts like hell. Every thought of every second is just me complaining about my inevitable loneliness. I had no right to expect anything from her. I was nothing to her. Im just a god damn pathetic loser. Im a nobody who wanted to be a somebody. I just want this eternal pain to stop.
2612,How do I maked this stop,"I want to jump off a bridge or srow myself in front of a train+ preferably Amtrak. Which is more likely to besuccessful
I'm so depressed and nothing is helping

Help."
2613,"When you think about killing yourself and why you should do it, do you feel like you're thinking clearly?",
2615,"I don't want to die, but I feel like I have to at this point ?","I have an unexplained chronic pain condition that I'm trying to figure out but I've spent so many years in horrible pain and I've lost so much that i feel like it's too late, I've run out of time and there is no fixing my problem. I dont really feel all that depressed, I'm 100% lucid and feel completely logical/in my right mind I just feel I've reached the end of what I'm willing to tolerate. I dont want to die, but I dont want to live like this, I'm not sure what else to do honestly."

I dont want to die, but I dont want to live like this, I'm not sure what else to do honestly."
2618,I am so damn tired of existing,"It's so exhausting to pretend that you're okay. I just want it to end. I already messed up the first attempt. How long until I do it again, this time succeeding? I don't even care about my family, the girl I like, or my friends anymore."
2619,I don't think I'll ever be able to be happy again,"I've gone through so much trauma and I really can't take it anymore. Every five fucking seconds I'm dissociating or considering suicide to relieve me of this. 
I am done. When I'm not actively distracting myself I immediately think about suicide and feel empty. 
I don't even know what happiness is like anymore. I feel that was stripped off of me when I was a child. I was sexually abused often when I was 7-9 and I still have nightmares about it. I have nightmares about being raped every time I try to sleep. Main reason why I deprived myself off of it.
I don't think I'll ever manage to have a future either. I can't focus in school. 
I know that I won't. I'm too useless for that. 
My family also pays for a private school that I am supposed to visit but haven't regularly for a month now. 
I feel guilty about this too. 
I can't do this anymore i really just can't.
I wish the people i cared about would understand that me not living anymore would be a relief to me, a big one. 

I hate this world for it's unfairness and what it has done to me. I want to leave it, I do not want to live here. And I also hate myself, i could write an essay on why I am the worst human imaginable and actually deserve to die."
2620,"I’ve always been referred to by others as ‘her’. ‘Oh her, the one that tried to hang herself’. ‘Oh her, the one who doesn’t shut up’. ‘Oh her, the one with crackhead parents’. ‘Oh her, that chick who always tried to hang out with us’. I’m sick of being ‘her’. It fucking sucks sometimes.",
2622,"Im tired of being a burden, suicide is starting to cross my mind"," 

I'm a senior in college (I graduate next semester) I'm 29 had always struggled with finishing my degree. I found out completely out of nowhere that my financial aid got taken away because I'm apparently ""over credits"".

I was given multiple emails stating I WAS going to receive financial aid and I even **called the financial aid office at my college** before my semester even started to make sure everything would be in order for me to have a smooth semester.

I waited 3 whole weeks for that money to come in and didn't even have money for food and was almost 2 months behind on my rent because of this. It got to the point that I was becoming extremely behind on my course-work because I didn't have money for my textbooks and course materials.

My family is very low income, my father has Parkinson's disease and has so much debt he can barely afford to live and my mother only makes about 25k a year. My family doesn't really have the means to help me and I can't even really have them co-sign any loans. My mother had to help me financially a lot this semester (eating less in order to send me money), I also work but only PT for the time being as I only have 1 semester left.

tbh, I did horrible this semester I haven't gotten my final grades back but I'm positive I failed at least half my classes due to the overwhelming financial stress this whole ordeal has been. I completely shut down this semester, I tried to focus on my coursework but I just had zero motivation, this entire semester I've constantly stress to pay my rent, and basic living expenses. I could barely commit to studying because I simply had no will power to.

The whole experience made me so emotionally upset because of how little my university cared about my situation they basically treated me like some f\*\* up. that on top of being surrounded by middle to upper-class students I feel so disconnected because I know most these students aren't dealing with as much as I am and it just infuriates me because I can see and obvious factor of these students successes in academia is mostly due to ""mommy and daddy's money"". If I simply got the $2000 loan I needed for my rent and materials the outcome of this semester would have been completely different.

I'm just trying to understand why I couldn't muster the will power to put effort into my studies. Could anyone help me out?"
2623,"Hi i am 20 years old, and my life is completely destroyed, abolished,","Im 20 years, and my life is completely destroyed, around 14 i started having extreme schizophrenia, extreme anxiety to a point where its hard for me to speak to people like saying hello or anything, my anxiety was so bad i could barely make eye contact, i also have extreme OCD the things i tend to try extremely hard not to do, would be the things i would do most of the time, and now i am Hiv+, my mental illness's were bad, but i was never suicidal, and i wasn't a broken soul like i am now, i was able to live, i was still somewhat happy, but ever since im now Hiv+ i've lost all hope in humanity and i've lost all hope in everything. If it we'rent for my 2 beautiful, kind loving sisters i would have offed my self without a thought. my heart is destroyed, it can't take anymore, its in pieces, dark little pieces, so just know everybody if you are feeling down you can come read this story and i'm sure it will make you'r going through much tolerable. I thought i was depressed before because i had no intrest in life, but now i know what real depression is, when you stay up all night not being able to sleep because your heart is so broken. Thank you for reading this"
2624,I hurt,Shit I don’t know what to do. I’m a piece of shit and always will be. I just hurt 😞 I’ve been dealing with people telling me it’s going to be ok. I really don’t think it does shit just breathing hurts. I’ve tried to end things four this year and it don’t think it’s going to get better shit I’m about to be 34 if life doesn’t get better before that when will it. My mom had my gun in her drawer I just have for her to go to work and I can grab it. It’s my gun but I’m to iffy so she has it. I just want darkness.
2625,"I went to therapy, made my dog food and meditated today!","I'm getting a bit better. I hit rock bottom with the hangover from hell after doing 15~ lines of md over a 36 hour period and I've decided to go sober and get back on track.

I cooked my dog a massive amount of food with beef mince, zucchini, peas, eggs, and spinach that I've frozen and will be able to feed her over the next week.

My therapy appointment went well and I think I'm making progress.

Mindfulness is really helping me and I think it's getting easier to fall into the right state.

Thank you to this subreddit for talking to me through harder times :)"
2626,Hamster wheel brain.,"I am going to spill everything about my life. Every embarrassment, every shameful secret, every insecurity, everything that I can think of right now, though I'm sure I'll forget a few things. I'm laying my ass on the line with no pretensions of honor or dignity. 

I could spend hours trying to figure out where to start, so I'm just going to dive right into this bullshit jacuzzi before I second guess myself to death.

I am a weak person. I am easily swayed and emotionally fragile. I see a little baby, a precious animal, or Maximus' death in the film Gladiator, and I have to hold back an inordinate flood of tears. If I perceive that someone is upset with me, whether a stranger or a loved one, my heart is crushed, I feel pressure in my chest, jaw, and temples, and my day is over. Whenever I see myself in the mirror, a 31 year old version of the same self I grew up hating, I see the pain and hope in my own eyes, I feel like a self-serving impostor, but I go through wild swings of self-love and self-loathing. One day I will be riding the clouds, the next day I'm down in hell scraping charred shit off Satan's patio. I confuse myself. I dizzify my soul on a tire-swing of ridiculous thoughts. I'm tin foil. 

I often have trouble expressing myself vocally. I feel like such a tangle of ideas that nothing really gets through. I feel like a busy intersection with only red and yellow lights, no green; sometimes a few cars can squeak through, but it's mostly a graveyard. I can physically feel that jammed junction in the very top of my skull. I feel like I must have been exposed to lead at some point in my childhood because...there are just these inexplicable mental blocks in moments I need to process information quickly. Basically, I'm smart enough to realize how dumb I am, but too stupid to find a way past it. I can maintain a front of togetherness, but it's skin-deep and I'm always on edge. At a past job I would regularly sneak to the restroom, lock the door, turn off the lights and just stand there, in silence, with my eyes open in the pitch black. Crippling anxiety isn't a thing that comes and goes, it's a daily, hourly experience that dictates my every decision.

I am not a traditionally good and honest person. I regularly make little white lies about trivial things, and have done so since childhood, although I promise I am being completely truthful here. I am addicted to porn, which I try to keep secret from my wife, although I suspect she has an idea. I sometimes text an ex-girlfriend from years past because I'm horny and I miss her, and I hardly ever have sex with my wife. I have intrusive thoughts, often sexual fantasies that just present themselves out of nowhere. I am deeply embarrassed by all of this.

I'm also the lucky son of a child molester and I'm perpetually ashamed by that association. He never abused me but I've dreamt many times of shooting my father to death and continuing to shoot his corpse. I can safely say that I don't share any of those disgusting, unhealthy attractions myself, but I feel the stain of just being his sperm grown up. All through high school I was terrified of someone looking in the piblic records, seeing my father, and connecting the dots. Honestly, he is the one who fucked everything up. Goddamn piece of shit. He continued the legacy of abuse passed down from previous generations of shitbag fathers. He truly fucked my family up. AND YET, at the same time I fantasize about his blood-soaked body on our old front porch, I have this sympathetic tendency to try to forgive and forget. ""He was a victim of an abusive household, so go easy on him."" I don't know what else I can say to quantify how I feel about him. I hate him for what he did but I tolerate his continued existence.

(I also think I have a bit of bisexual curiosity, not a huge part of my sexuality, but I would be open to an experience with another man if he had a strong, marble sculpture kind of androgynous appearance.)

Here's a fun one. I have IBS, big time. My stomach can't handle shit. At least a few times a week I'll be squirming in pain trying to hold in my explosive diarrhea. I even shit my pants when I was 13 after eating some cake and deciding to tag along to the beach with my family. Great memory! The whole drive back I tried to peddle the theory that someone had merely stepped in dog shit. All windows in the car were down. Somehow I managed not to destroy the front passenger seat. Nowadays I tell myself that people have forgotten, but really, I know they remember. They may not think of it near as often as I do, but they remember. So you can see how that has helped build a complex of reclusion within me.

Once, at a funeral many years back, my cousin was crying loudly right next to me, so I TRIED to comfort her...by placing my hand on her knee...except it was a bit too high, more like her lower thigh, and in my desperate attempt to emulate real human emotion and console her, my hand lingered for a bit too long. I realized how wrong it seemed and quickly removed my hand. I don't think anyone even noticed, but because of my father's history, I FELT LIKE A TOTAL DISGUSTING CREEP. To this day it's one of those memories that makes me physically twitch and try to block it out. 

I am a people pleaser and a perfectionist to the very core. This is often paralyzing and I let people walk all over me. My first real girlfriend, in fact, literally annoyed her way into my life, and from to my lack of self-respect I just couldn't find the balls to refuse her. It's funny, reflecting back on it honestly, she literally fucking used me. She took advantage of a lonely loser who was desperate for human connection, we had T.O.N.S. of unprotected sex and miraculously didn't create another unwanted life, although I think trapping me into parenthood was her ultimate goal. After a couple years I grew some nuggets and told her to fuck off.

During that time, I met the girl who would become my wife ten year later, and who is the best thing to ever happen to me. She has so many insecurities just like me, and we can identify with each other in ways I never thought were possible. It almost as if we're telepathic, to a degree. She makes me truly happy on a spiritual level and together we have grown as human beings. And yet, I feel like an impostor. The internal demons pester me. How do I deserve her? I don't know anything about life, how can I take care of her? What could she possibly see in me? And it's that bullshit going on inside me thay drives me to betray her trust. I will NEVER physically cheat, but yes, I have ""digitally"" cheated countless times by watching porn and lusting after my ex-girlfriend's naked body. I am broken. There is nothing I wouldn't do for my beautiful wife, to make her happy, make her life better, but here I am playing out this self-fulfilling prophecy because I don't think I'm worth half of a rabid cat's shit log. I am toying with the ultimate heartbreak because part of me has simply checked out of Hotel Vida. I don't think I deserve pity or forgiveness...I think I deserve a round of buckshot through this failed psychological experiment between my ears. Ideally way out in the mountains, where nature would dispose of me long before my scattered bones were discovered. Mr. Mossberg is hanging there on the wall, I can see his stock peering out from behind the door. If I'm gonna go, I may as well take my old man off this planet as well, before I turn in my own keys.

I'm just thinking, you know? I've thought about this many times. And many times I've found something worth living for, exactly in the form of my wife and my family. I don't want to take my pain and pour it all over them. But I truly, truly do not want to live anymore. The idea of death is exciting, it makes me smile for the slumber it would bring. Even on my best days, I can't escape the feeling that my life has been one massive, sloppy embarrassment. I haven't learned what I should know by now. I am a weak and crumbling person. I just want to sleep, I want to go back to the calm void I was in before I was pointlessly plopped into a lower middle class vanilla nightmare. If I had no one to live for, I wouldn't waste another second awake."
2627,I'm sad,I figured out what's more heartbreaking than holding these thoughts inside is telling people about them &amp; having them not help in any way. not even a talk.
2628,Does anyone know of any Pro-suicide sites or literature?,I assume it's not allowed to post but you can dm me if you know of any.
2629,want to fucking die want to fucking slit my wrists,i won’t pass anything it’s my first semester of college but who cares !!! mom won’t respond he won’t talk to me !! nothing fucking matters i wish i didn’t throw away my razor !!! want to ducking look for another on so i can just get it over with !!!!! my belts are gone too haha haha oh well who ducking cares i won’t do anything nothing will work out i want to fucking die i don’t fucking care anymore and autocorrect keeps correcting fucking to ducking and i HATE IT !!!!!!! i want to die i can’t do anything i missed 2 classes because i was horribly sick oh okay prof tate you want me to go in while vomiting and having to go to the bathroom every 3 seconds and having to lay down and groaning in pain and vomiting all over your floor? ok works for my i’ll throw up on you!! and get you sick and everyone else sick!!!! i want to ducking XIE i’m an awful person!!!!!
2630,I want to get back at her,I want to get back at her for leaving me. I’m gonna record myself ODing and send it to her before I die. I want to haunt her.
2631,I carry around a suicide note everywhere I go,"Around two to three months ago I wrote a suicide note when I was planning to kill myself. 

I didn't kill myself the night I was going to but I kept the suicide note. Every single day I pick up the folded note and put it in my pocket.  I'm not sure why I do it. 

I don't even remember what I wrote on it anymore."
2632,To sum up suicidal depression...,"Having suicidal depression is like being the first one to grieve your own death while still being alive...

I don't even think in the mindset of a person who is alive anymore. It's like I am the first victim of my own suicide bereavement. The only thing is I'm not dead yet. 

Everything I think about is all within the past tense.

Everything I think about involves ""was, did, had, used to, etc, etc."" Or words like ""miss, remember, etc""

It's like I think from the mindset of a person who lives after I die, and knew me. While I was alive, all while still being alive. 

It's scary how much depression can change a person. 

Getting out of bed nowadays requires the energy and motivation to run a marathon it seems like."
2633,I just want to cry,Everything seems to be falling apart. My home life’s gone to shit. My parents are always at each others’ throats and my brother started cutting himself again. I want to finish my research degree but none of my experiments are working and I only have less then 3 weeks left (so looks like I can’t move on with my life yet). My health is going to shit so I can’t drink to calm down. I haven’t been able to sleep right for almost a week now. My psychiatrist died so I have no one to talk to about any of this and the freaking crisis line kept me on hold for 15 min before I gave up and hung up. I just want to curl up and cry. I just want everything to stop for a bit. To just freeE and go quiet...
2634,I just want it to be over.,"Everything. All of it. I want it to be over. 

I doubt anyone cares though, no one ever cares."
2635,Prolly gonna do it sometime this month,
2636,I don't know if I can do this anymore,"I feel like everything is just crashing down on me right now. Work is stressful, I have an exam soon that I know I'm going to fail, I don't even want to be in uni, my sport that I'm competing in varsity for is tearing me apart, I'm lonely, I'm awkward, I'm anxious, and I don't know if I can handle it. I can't drop out no matter how much I want to. I can't quit my job. I can't leave my sport. I don't know what to do. I don't know how much more I can fucking take."
2637,I want to die sometimes,"I was a pretty normal teen for a while. I went to school talked with friends and came home. That was my routine every day for years. Then middle school and high school came around. During middle school this idea that I was not good enough started to play in my head. My anxiety spiked because of this and I began to sweat excessively every time I felt even a slight bit uncomfortable. This is where the feeling of wanting to die started. Because of this problem I was forced to wear clothes that were not ideal for a young girl. I wore black clothes all the time and the feeling of having the sweaty clothes stick to my body only reminded me each and every day how disgusting and weird I was compared to everyone else. That's how my middle school experience was. An endless pit of self hate and sweat.

Then high school started. I thought this was my chance to start things over but god forbid I have anything good happen to me and the sweating continued and actually got worse. Then I stumbled upon the worst thing I could ever have found ""If you sweat a lot just have a nice body and slowly you wont even remember the sweating"". That is what I read on an article after searching ""ways yo help cope with sweating"". I of course misinterpreted the whole thing and assumed it meant I had to be skinny but really the article meant you should dress and feel good about your body ect. Not until my friend invited me to the water park did this really start to set in. I started dieting from the minute I got the news we were going. I would eat 100 calories or less a day and my whole day was wrapped around my exercise. Every minute of the day was mapped out from when I would eat and run and rest and exercise more and when i didn't do my workouts I would not eat at all the next day. I lost weight doing this of course. I lost 30 pounds and was feeling so good. It didn't stop there though. I wanted a flat stomach. I wanted to look like the models I saw on Instagram and magazines. I continued to diet until I realized that wasn't good for me and started to follow a healthier diet. That didn't last long. Soon after I learned about throwing up after eating junk. That became my daily return soon after. I would stuff myself till my stomach hurt then throw it up like an unclogged pipe spitting out sludge. I have been caught by my parents already. They found the garbage bags I had been throwing up in. Now I can no longer throw up. I have been doing very well these past 4 days in not binge eating but today I broke down and binged. I didn't exactly binge on super unhealthy food but I did eat way to many calories (3000-5000). I feel like crap because of it. I want to die. Idk why I have no control and I hate that I let myself get to this place. Food is no longer something I find enjoyable and I hate that stupid saying ""food brings people together"" because for me all it is doing it taking people away from me. I plan on not eating tomorrow and if i do I am almost certain I wont make it to see another day

Thank you to anyone who read this and I am sorry if this makes no sense. This small explanation will never be enough to describe my whole life and what im going through. I only hope someone can relate or at least send prayers for me down in hell. only angels deserve heaven and I am sure as heck no angel.

Goodnight"
2638,Eyes,"Have you ever looked at yourself in a mirror...deeply in the eyes and see the gaping hole in your soul? It seems to me that that moment is the only time I'm honest with myself about who I am. I dont know what I like, What makes me happy, where I want to be in 5 years... but I do know that as long as I can tie the mask around my face every day, I'll be..just..fine."
2639,Will someone help?,I try to say hints to my friends and peers around me that i’m not okay. I have been trying to get someone to notice. i just need someone who is silent and will just hug me. I have a therapist but I can’t come to tell her how i really feel. Honestly i feel numb and empty. It makes my stomach feel sick and like it’s going in slow circles. I just found this reddit. I thought maybe i’d feel comfortable here.
2640,I gave it all I got well see if it works out if not it's the end my friends,"I usually come here post something then delete it 5 minutes later but there no point in that now. It truly dosnt matter.  I have tried for so long and they always say it gets better. When my mom and dad left when I was three, they said it would be ok, when i went to 10 diffrent foster homes and 2 group homes all in a year , they said I would be ok, when my foster parents physically abused me for 12 years( like slamming my head through walls punching me in the face actual abuse) they said it would get better,when I got kicked out of my parents house and moved into my first apartment only to be swindled out of it by my so called friends and left me to be homeless, the said it would get better, I finally got a new place and new job then my job cut my hours...8 hours a week....dosnt even cover my snacks...still they said it would get better, here's the truth guys...it dosnt get better I tried everything nothing works...I applied to two new jobs tomorrow if that dosnt work I'm done at least I can say I tried...they say that to commit sucide u need to have a level head which is almost impossible for people with depression or sucidal tendencies. But I been in so much pain...It hurts to breath sometimes. It's hard to wake up sometimes. It's a lie guys they want us to be happy and stay here so that we make them feel better. They dont want us to die because they'll feel bad. Most of us cant feel anything anymore...
Wish me luck with my jobs guys it's my last shot 

Tldr living is for nerds lol"
2641,What the hell is wrong with me?,"Found out my wife of 12 years was cheating on me.  She was travelling to Germany with our money to go to a conference (she's pursuing an MBA and said she wanted to do some networking).

Cheated in April, went back to Germany in October and cheated again with the same guy.  Finally came clean around Halloween about what was really going on.

She spared no detail in coming clean, and I felt like I was going to throw up/like the air was made of jello.  I tried working things out with her, because shit, 12 years, I still love her, 2 kids, etc....  Finally saw a picture of her snuggling the guy and looking happier than I've seen in years. 

It was all too much, so I downed about 100 benadryl.  Queue police, ambulance ride, 6 hours in the ER unconcious and intubated, couple days in the ICU unconcious, and when I finally woke up, strapped to a gurney and shipped off for an 8 day stay in a lovely looney bin.

I've been out and doing good for a while now, but tonight I just fucking snapped and headed to the store to buy a few more bottles of pills.  By the time I got home, my resolve was wavering, but I still wanted to take a lyft to a hotel room and down the bottles.

Haven't done it yet, and I've decided to stay alive tonight.

Throw away account for obvious reasons."
2642,I never chose this life,"Life is increasingly difficult.

I got fired today after a two-week bout of post-traumatic depression.

I’ve done some really bad shit I’ve been trying to get past but my friends won’t forgive me.

I’ve betrayed them.

I want to die so badly."
2643,alone and suicidal,"I feel like I've always been alone. no one knows the shit i went through in my life except for my partner and my brother, who was in the same situation. I can't reach out to my brother because I would only burden him more. he has so many problems himself and I don't want to add to that. I distanced myself from my only parent because every time I trusted him he used that trust to make the worst insults he could possibly think of.

I tried reaching out to my partner but he didn't pick up. According to him he was asleep but I saw that he was active on facebook before and after the call. I just want someone to be there for me the way I've been there for others. That's all I ever wanted, a happy relationship and I'm incapable of even sustaining that.

I'm such a self-pitying mess and I have to go to school in about an hour even though that's the worst place for me right now, but I have mandatory attendance. I don't remember the last time I was as suicidal as I am now even though it's always in the back of my mind. I can't do it anymore. every time i make progress I go back to the same point I was at before.

I was crying before going to sleep and I've been crying since I woke up. I feel like throwing up and doing something fo myself. anything. preferably throwing myself in front of a train or from a building. I just don't want to exist."
2644,I really just don't know anymore,"What happened?

I’m 19[M] in my second year of college, and I just don’t know any more.
I was part of the scholar’s bowl/quiz bowl/whatever you want to call it for almost all of my middle and high school years, I was in my school’s honors chemistry for all of 2 weeks, when the teacher told me ‘Hey, you’re good at this stuff, want to go into chem II?’ a class which is for all intents and purposes a senior-only class, as a junior, and the teacher regarded me as better than most of the actual seniors (and actually told me as such)?
I started/founded the after-school Magic: The Gathering club at my high school, my teachers all loved me, I was selected for a special bonus class ‘Dale Carnegie Leadership Course’ because I was one of the best students in my program. My teachers loved me, said I was going places.

So what the fuck happened?
Why am I miles behind on my coursework in several of my classes? 
Why do I have thoughts like “Wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up”, or “I remember a story about some kid dying of a heart attack or something from too much caffeine, I wonder how many 200mg tablets of caffeine it would take?”, or “I wonder if the 20ga with birdshot I use for skeet shooting is enough?”, “I wonder if depriving myself of sleep for a day or two and walking off into the woods in the middle of winter in the dead of night would work”, or having recently developed some form of vertigo type symptoms (that I have yet to visit/tell a medical professional about) “maybe if I leave it alone, I’ll get dizzy at the top of a nice long flight of stairs, and break my worthless fucking neck”.
Why does it feel like I’m just not in control, losing hours of my life watching pointless drivel on YouTube or browsing the web like I’m in a trace, snapping ‘awake’ hours later going what the fuck am I doing with my life?
               Why is that when I start to tear up while thinking about these things I mentally think “Suck it up buttercup, suck in those tears, put on your poker face, you fucking made this mess, now reap your rewards you fucking piece of trash”.
Hell, while writing this I’m thinking to myself “Why are you writing this fucking melodramatic garbage that there’s a good chance you’re not even going to post when you could be working on the piles and piles of homework you due tomorrow you flaming fucking piece of human trash”?
Why does it feel like I have no attention span anymore? I used to be able to just hunker down and do things for hours on end, but now if I don’t have a distraction in front of me, I feel jittery.
Why do my emotions feel muted? Like I never really get excited, or happy? Like I always talk in the same dispassionate mono-tone?
Why don’t I enjoy any of my hobbies anymore?
Why does it feel like failing at college is the end of the world even when rationally I know it isn’t? Why does it feel like I just don’t care about anything anymore?
 Why does it feel like if I’m not good at school I’m not worth anything?
Why can’t I get out of bed for classes in the morning anymore? I set my alarms, and then I wake up 1,2,3 hours later to find them turned off and no recollection of ever turning them off? 
Why don’t I go to bed at a reasonable time to try and deal with the above?
I have no friends, other than the few people I play D&amp;D with online, but they all live in Sweden, and while they aren’t ‘fair-weather friends’, they also aren’t the kind of friends you can just dump emotional baggage on.
I’ve had no relationships, although I feel I’m fine with that, and I probably never will, which I’m also fine with.

I honestly don’t know why I ask myself “what happened?”. I know exactly what happened, nothing. I was always this way, lazy, worthless, never doing homework, always turning in work late or not at all.

Sure the ‘suicidal ideation’ is new, but that’s probably from the stress of having not done my work and feeling it catch up with me, and the feeling of having burned 24k with 2 years of college I’m not going to get anything from. I never changed, it’s just that my habits have finally caught up with me.
I wish something was wrong with me, that I have depression, that I have ADHD or some other issue that prevents me from being a ‘functional member of society’, but I know I don’t. I’m just habitually lazy, from years of gliding through elementary, middle and high school, being satisfied with C’s &amp; B’s, but knowing full well that whole time I could get A’s if I really wanted to, but never actually wanting to.

Part of me wants to tell somebody, to try and get diagnosed, to see if there actually is something wrong, but I think a bigger part of me fears that if I do tell someone, that I do go to get diagnosed, they’ll just tell me to stop being so melodramatic and own up to my failures, that they’ll find nothing wrong with me, and I’ll have to face reality and accept that I am lazy human garbage with no excuse. I feel I’m viewing having a mental illness as a “magic bullet”, or pipe-dream, thinking if I go get tested I can say “oh I had depression, or oh I have ADHD, so it really wasn’t really under my control”, knowing full well that’s a garbage fucking excuse for my laziness. And even if I do get an appointment, even if I do see someone about it, I know full well I will lie to their face, trying my damn best to seem fine, to seem like a normal, functioning member of society, because that’s the face I wear, my default state, because I feel that because I made this mess, it’s my job alone to clean it up, and no-one else’s. 

I know full well that for all my thoughts, for all the little nicks on my shoulders, all the little shocks, unless I just drop dead randomly, I’ll never actually attempt. That would require resolve, or motivation, or will-power, and if I had any of those things I wouldn’t be in this mess. So, I’ll just quietly fail my courses, get berated for failing and burning 24k like a worthless delinquent, and I’ll work at the local McDonalds, or grocery store, or even both, and just mindlessly go along. Paying off my student loans I never got anything from, with a little hope in the back of my head that maybe one day, once I’ve paid them off so my mother doesn’t get saddled with my mistakes, I’ll get struck by a little meteor, or hit by drunk driver, or just drop dead from some medical anomaly.  
I honestly don’t know why I’m posting this, nothing will change, no amount of ‘thoughts and prays’ type sentiments from strangers will change me.  Just hollow words on deaf ears. Though I really don’t have any right to complain, I’m white, I’m male, I live in the USA, I have a loving family, there are those who have it so much worse than me, so why should I complain?  Maybe I’ll send the link to my mother for shits and giggles, and she’ll say my creative writing skills need work, or she’ll believe me, but then she hears my normal voice, or I sound like I’m grinning, and she’ll think it was all a lie. Or more likely, I’ll keep it a little secret, just between me and Reddit, because my Grandmother just got hospitalized, and while she recovered, because we live in great and wonderful ‘Murica, her medical bills will be a small fortune, and I don’t want to drop that I’ve likely wasted 24k and 2 years of my life, and might even need medical diagnosis, meaning more medical bills and more small fortunes.
I’m torn between posting this on my main account, and a throwaway, it’s not like anyone knows what my Reddit name is, but maybe if I ever do make it out of this ‘rut’, I don’t know if I want the post to be potentially found later. 

Also, sorry about the lack of indents/propper paragraph formatting, Reddit doesn't seem to want to copy them over from Word."
2645,Don’t want to tell anyone I am suicidal because I am afraid of what will happen,"If I told someone, would I be forced to live in a mental hospital? Will I have to be under constant supervision? Will I never be allowed to be by myself? Or will simply no one care?"
2646,I've Had a Rough Time of It and I Want to Die,"Before I start, I want to make it known that I am 13.

So, I've been struggling with these thoughts for a while, but today was really bad for me. My grandma had colon cancer and she passed away this afternoon. Ever since I found out I've been trying to think of ways to go. I know people would be even sadder, but I just can't do it anymore."
2647,My girlfriend leaving me was not something I am emotionally strong enough to handle,I don’t know if I can keep going. Deep. Deep. Depression.
2648,Trapped,"Honestly, the only reason I’m not dead yet is because I know the funeral cost and medical bills will be expensive. I don’t want to do this to mom she already struggles enough to get by. I don’t think she can deal with a dead son and those type of expensive bills. Living is already hell for me, and I don’t want to make hers any worse."
2649,I'm beconing a danger to myself.,I just can't take it anymore. I hate that I was born and how I was born. I can't anymore. I'm sorry
2650,"When I look at my life from the outside, I feel blessed. I have everything I ever dreamed off.","I have a boyfriend, all my family members are alive, I live in the best city in a luxury apartment, I’m a model, I’m healthy, I don’t have to work outside of my side hobbies, I go to school and I have good grades, I’m skinny, I have nice hair... however, nothing is fulfilling. I have never felt so low and empty in my life. Every morning I wake up, I’m sad that I have to  live and I didn’t die in my sleep.
I’m tired, drained, exhausted. I’m agonizing. I can’t live anymore. I disgust myself. I cant look at myself in the mirror without feeling nauseous."
2651,Everything I do to try to get good at something fails,I have tried to at least be good at something but always end up failing even with practice and etc. I am so pissed at myself I really wander why I am still here I have no talent why should I keep going. People say practice makes perfect and everything takes time then why the heck do people already have skills to do there things already.
2652,"A rough draft of my final note. (Warning: lots of text, but I basically give as much information as I can without doxxing myself.)"," To my parents, friends and acquaintances, former classmates and coworkers, those who cared about me, and to the public servants who will find and investigate the scene of my death:

  There was no other way this could have ended. 

  There is nothing you could have done which would have prevented me from taking my own life. Perhaps, you might have been able to delay the inevitable for a year or couple of years. But in the end, it was always going to end like this. One important lesson I learned during my brief time as a correctional officer is that it is impossible to save everybody. No matter how hard you try, there will always be those people who are just out of reach, who you can never pull back from the precipice. I am one of them. There is nothing you could have done to save me, no matter how hard you tried.

 The hand I was dealt in life was never a pleasant one. I have been diagnosed with diseases of the body and the mind. I suffer from interstitial cystitis, a debilitating chronic inflammation of the bladder which causes intense pain and frequent urination on a daily basis. My brain is assaulted in alternation by the gloom of depression, the uncertainty and worry of anxiety, and the compulsive rituals of OCD. There are some days where I am unable to crawl out of bed, at least until the burning urge to urinate once every half hour kicks in when my bladder flares up, and after rising up to urinate, I have no energy to do anything to go back to bed. When I do get up and go about my daily routines, my mind cannot help but think of everything that can go wrong. What if I am hit by a car? What if I am wrongfully accused of shoplifting? When I drive, every little bump on the road makes me immediately think that I have accidentally hit another vehicle or a pedestrian, and when those morbid ideas enter my head, panic takes over and reigns for hours on end.

 And yet, nobody can say that I didn't fight hard to make my way in life. I remember choosing to not let my disabilities get in the way of serving my community. I remember applying to become a correctional officer, lying on my application and during my medical exam about my medical history. I remember taking nearly twenty ibuprofen a day during the academy to help alleviate the pain in my bladder to the point where my adrenaline could help me push through (albeit with some difficulty.) I remember making on great, herculean effort to push through the clouds in my head, and I remember standing at graduation, giving the speech as our class president, and then swearing our oath to the public. No, nobody can say that I just gave up on myself. I fought to the end. But even my best effort cannot keep me going for years and years. Indeed, only a few months after graduation, my medical conditions caught up to me and I was left with no choice but to resign from law enforcement.

 Meeting the inmates inside the prison walls also gave me a new perspective on the country in which we live. For every truly evil man I met, I saw five or ten who had simply been let down by society. I met those who grew up in poverty and knew nothing but survival by any means necessary. I met talented artists, singers, rappers, even cooks, all of whom were denied the chance to make good of their talents. And furthermore, I started reflecting on how society has failed me. I remember being denied social security disability payments because of bureaucratic nonsense. I remember all the psychiatrist's I saw who I never confessed my suicidal ideations to because I remembered people being put on suicide watch and then being billed hundreds of thousands of dollars for their ""treatment.""

 Life is difficult. Life is a battle. I respect all those who are fighting that battle valiantly. I have nothing but the highest of respect for anybody who wakes up every morning and continues to stare life's challenges in the face and do their best to overcome them. I wish I could be as stoic and as brave as you. In a different life, had I not been born with a variety of illnesses of both mind and body, I might have been willing to fight the good fight. But as it is, life is a battle that I have lost.

 Please donate any organs that can be salvaged from by body for the wellbeing of others. Hopefully, they can use those organs more productively than I did. And please, cremate the rest of me and scatter my ashes by (a mountain range that I loved when I was younger.) I do not believe in any deities, or any afterlife. There is simply no scientific proof for any of those myths, and in addition, why would a loving merciful god create a society where there have to be prisons, or chronic medical disabilities, or a fucked up healthcare system that charges hundreds of thousands for a single stay at the hospital? No, there is no god and no afterlife. I know that as I close my eyes for the last time, that I will simply be at peace and finally be free from the pains and worries which have dragged me down thus far. 

I am sorry it came down to this. I am sorry for the grief I have undoubtedly caused you. But please remember, there is simply no other way this could have ended for me."
2653,"Just wanna join Tara, Laura, Christine, etc.","All those beautiful people that I came across their suicides online, I wish to join them onto the journey of eternity and to be forever free from being human and to be eons away from human suffering   . To eternity I wish that you grant me the eternal freedom. Take my hand and my breath. Earth you can have this body."
2654,Another anxiety more,"Came back. 
This time it was worse. You know how you're going to die, but it keeps you to hurt you to suffer your family, after you die will be fine. No? That you wanted. 
At last you found a page like you who read, that you wanted. Come on, quiet. Another anxiety more and goodbye to the world."
2655,Sighs.... I haven’t eaten or moved in two days &amp; now I’m probably going back to the psych ward,
2656,I'm going to drink myself to death,"I spent a large amount of money on alcohol and plan to drink it over the day until I hopefully die, drunk and in a pool of my own vomit.

Nobody cares anyway. They all say they do but push comes to shove and here I am alone."
2657,Want to kill myself,"Sup folks the title is accurate. I’ve been so sad and felt so worthless for years. Just want someone to talk to rn, I really want to finally do it tonight. Thank god for liquor for making me brave enough to actually do it"
2658,first suicidal thoughts in a while,idk a kid said today that I never eat and when you search body postivity on here the top results include fat shaming subs
2659,Tired of fighting,I tired of being tired. I’m tired of fighting. This morning I didn’t want to try again. I didn’t want to fight. Why fight when I didn’t do anything wrong to my  body. Why fight. I shouldn’t be fighting this hard. I’m tired of living
2660,Should I kill myself?,"I'm really not happy with life and I've been going to therapy and taking meds for 7 years. No change. Should I just end it? I have no one and I genuinely don't want to live anymore and I haven't for a while. It seems it would be better for me if I just died, yanno?"
2661,It's hard to get help when all you know is to keep emotions to yourself and vent to strangers on a subreddit....,Close to hurting myself enough to be forced to go to the hospital..
2662,yeah...,being a 19 year old girl and hearing the things i’ve heard makes life even more unbearable
2663,I did some bad things,"First off I want to start by telling you I am age **14** I will not reveal myself at all,

Well, the first bad thing I did was I had some encounters with my little sister, now she is **10** I know that what I did was 100% wrong but I never did anything along the lines of rape. I never penetrated her it more just rubbing of genitals. I know she can't be pregnant she hasn't had her first period so it's not possible. I am worried for her future I want to still be a brother she looks up to and all of that, this has had my anxiety at an all-time high to the point where I can't focus on school.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I masturbated with my step mom's undergarments I feel as if she may be pregnant but I did put them through the was (Coldwater with Durgent is what I used also dried in the dryer) My mom later said that she had her tubes tied something along that but I feel she is Lying to make me stop stressing and worrying

I am in a huge deep black hole with no way up right now,"
2664,Being a burden.,"I was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2009 and it has ruined my life. I could never have my dream career in the military. I had to drop out of school in 2015 because my seizures are stressed induced and I had one the week of finals that killed me. I lost a month of memories, which included studying for said finals and seeing my family. 
I was in the hotel industry for ten years until recently I became an embarrassment to my company (my Hr manager said that) after I had a seizure while Hilton was on my property. Since then I have been blackballed in the city I live in. I can only do curtain jobs due to safety reasons so a lot of jobs I want I can’t do. 
I lost my license because of them. 
I have weird emotional changes that can happen in a second and my family doesn’t want to deal with it anymore. My moms birthday is tomorrow and they had a little family get together today that I wasn’t invited to. I just happened to find out about. 
I haven’t slept well in years and have ptsd from dying in my sleep and I am afraid to fall asleep. 
The last few months my mental health has gone down hill very quickly. A side of me says I’m fine and the other says swallow a bunch of sleeping pills and end the burden you place on your family and friends.  
Im just so lost and the fight in my head I’m slowly loosing!"
2665,I just missed my final.,"So last semester I took a leave (too busy thinking about suicide), so I had to retake a few subjects. I returned and retook the math subject and I was doing well. I thought my final for that subject was today, and I didn't have any friends to ask, so I just went to the maths deparment. I was just informed the exam was two days ago. I really don't know how to take this. I was trying so hard to improve myself and this shit happens."
2666,I tried calling a hotline for the first time.,I live outside US and I feel so low and I can’t see anything because of the tears as I type this but I called the hotline cause I don’t know what to do anymore I just wanna kill myself and...it said the all the representatives are engaged in other calls. How lucky of me
2667,Lost,"Hi .....
This is new to me . Never vented to anything else other than myself . I have had mental illness especially suicide since 7 or 8 . I am now 27 years old still struggling . Only at this time in my life has been one of the worse life changing experience I’ve ever had . I decided to make a big move from NJ (born &amp; raised) to NC at the end of October. Two weeks before I moved I found out I was pregnant. I am currently 14 weeks &amp; decided to keep my baby . I was a manager in NJ &amp; my job was suppose to transfer me which they lied &amp; it didn’t fall through . So I’ve been without employment since 10/2 . I am desperate for work . I can’t pay my bills . I’m about to have a baby in June . The baby father is an dipshit . I have no support mentally at all . Ive just been feeling very alone . No one to turn to . I can’t even vent to people I thought was close to me because their answers to my problems is abort my baby , move back home (I have nowhere to live back in NJ) , &amp; my mind has been spiraling out of control . I be wanting to just end my life but the only thing that has me clinging &amp; holding on to life is my unborn child . I just feel like such a failure already to my child especially myself . I just don’t know what to do . I’ve applied to about 100 places that won’t take me even though I’m more than qualified for most of the jobs I have applied to . I keep getting denied . I just don’t know what to do anymore . I don’t know how much longer I can hang on . I’m trying to be patient . But the closer a new month passes , I get anxious about how I won’t be able to provide for my baby , let along myself ."
2668,Today is my 43rd birthday.,"The depression is getting worse. I’m at a point where I don’t care about anything anymore. I’m not taking my meds as I should (not just for Bipolar but for other chronic illnesses). I literally stayed in bed all day today. I thought to myself, “What if I stay in bed so long that my muscles atrophy?” And I said aloud, “I honestly don’t care anymore and I don’t think anyone around me would care enough to help me.” There is literally not an ounce of hope left in me. I’m a waste. Happy fucking birthday."
2669,One of the things I hate most,"One of the things I hate most is feeling alone, but knowing that it's the best course of action. It's a recurring pattern that I didn't notice until a few years ago. People I've known for years have all flourished since less time is spent with me. They have succeeded in school, earned and maintained careers, dating, friendship. 

All I did was hold them back."
2670,"March 9, 2020",I decided yesterday to give it 3 months..
2671,I have zero redeeming qualities. I am a complete waste of space. Im having a hard time thinking why I shouldn’t do it,I’m a worthless mess who ruins everything I touch. I deserve Hell. I have to die
2672,"Nearly a decade of therapy, multiple diagnosed mental health issues ranging from moderate to severe, daily meds, studying for a future i dont want. Whats the point anymore?",Keeping people happy i know but im so emotionally unstable that someone will die by my hand. Im fucking terrified of that. Just let it be me
2673,i just need somebody to confide in,"i feel so hopeless and alone about everything and i have nobody to talk to, nobody who understands me well enough to give me advice. hardly anyone cares for me in the first place. i’m worse these past few days than i ever have been and every attempt i make to improve the situation backfires and makes everything worse. i don’t have any hope left."
2674,"I found harder drugs, and thisngot scary easy",Im laying in my friends bed and were stoned and I think I’m supposed to be happy or feel better but all I can think about is how my bag of pills at home I’m Savin for January 7th just got oxy added to it. And it scared me when I put it on - bevayse it just became so easy to do it and I want to do it because I have no future and I don’t believe anything is real anymore and I can never grow out of this but it’s so terrifying to know the thing I fantasize about in my every waking fucking moment is actually going to work
2675,I am just going to kill myself.,"Fuck this life, like it will ever going to change."
2676,Do doctors legally need to rescue me if I VSED?,"VSED = Voluntary Stopping of Eating and Drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that it ***is*** legal for a terminal ill patient to VSED and doctors are not allowed to force-feed them. However what's the legality of mental illness?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I don't have eating disorder, if that changes anything"
2677,I don't know if I can keep going.,"I have been suicidal since I was 7. It started when I moved to a new country and lost the ability to talk to my family and all I had here was my mom. Around this time my father and mother also separated. And that's around the time I started fantasizing about my death. Next my half sister was born and I started to feel like I was burdening my family. I hid these feelings because I didn't like telling people if I felt any type of negative emotion, anger,sadness, etc.

Fast forward a couple years and I had to prevent my friend from committing suicide. The stress from that event made everything unbearable and I started cutting to relieve some of the load and it worked. Last year, I stopped cutting due to a promise I made to someone. And I was trying to get better and stop my suicidal thoughts. I told my mom how I felt and she ended up ranting about how my generation is ""f**ked up"" and that I shouldn't feel like this. And that just further confirmed that I and the way I feel is a burden and I shouldn't talk about it. I want to die but its illegal here and if my attempt doesn't work then I could be thrown in jail. I've already attempted once and failed. I'm starting to think theres no hope of feeling better. I've just felt so hopeless and tired of fighting to live. I really don't want to be here anymore."
2678,i hate myself so much,i’m so fucking ugly and disgusting i can hardly stand it i literally can’t deal with it anymore. i just want to feel pretty i want to be someone that people aren’t embarrassed to be around i wish i could fix whatever’s wrong with me but i can’t. and i know it sounds shallow but i don’t want to be alive if i have to be ugly forever.
2679,I need to get this off my chest because it drives me to negative thoughts,"Ever since I was 8 I was burden with so many secrets, now that I’m 19 it is so heavy to carry. I grew up in a home riddled with substance abuse and violence. I thought for a long time I would be removed from my house so I never told a soul to the degree of it. I was raped at 15 and it haunts me especially because I have to go to the same college as that person. My first relationship was emotionally, verbally, physically and sexual abusive I still am processing it. I developed an eating disorder I hid from everyone despite collapsing on the side walk almost dying from being so underweight. A family member I grew up with took their life and I feel guilty. Then my next relationship I was with a “sweet” guy he just would get in phases of being super mean to me. I would cry and ask him to stop but he would just get more mad and tell me I’m guilting him. And I no where near call this physical abuse but he was getting blacked out numb/mad at someone else. I tried to calm him down by grabbing his arm but he shifted fast so it hit me. I cried secretly trying to get him to sleep. But he woke up without knowing anything that happened so I never told him. I just broke up with him a couple weeks later because he kept getting mad and it brought me back to the past. I just feel very alone with thoughts of suicide creeping in. I do not want to die at all, I just do not know how to process any of this. I think I’m good then it all rushes back I just do not understand it all. No one I’m around knows this stuff about me therefore I do not think they understand me. When they want to get closer with me I just stop because these things are too much for some people. I try to respect people by not letting my burden become a burden for them too."
2680,"What’s up with all the ‘rewards’ I’ve seen given to recent posts, of particular concern, posts where the OP seems extremely desperate and unstable?",I’m fairly new to Reddit so it’s possible that I am misunderstanding how ‘rewards’ work. Please explain. Thank you.
2681,I just tried to hang myself,Didn’t want to kill myself yet I just to my belt wrapped it around my neck and tied it on my door knob. I hung there for a bit with some pauses to breath in between I felt so pathetic and small. My small lamp was on and I was balled up in the corner of my room I felt so worthless but it felt right I felt like I finally was doing something right.
2682,I am having thoughts.," would anyone care?
it doesn't seem like it.
my mom doesn't even like me.
my friends are fake."
2683,Senior in College that's been contemplating suicide for past couple months now,"I've never created a post here before as I'm always reading rather than posting but today I mustered up some courage to write a post. Some background information : Graduated High School early to pursue a professional soccer career in Italy , failed twice on signing a contract due to injuries but was so close each time. I'm currently a Senior in college at a small private university in the Midwest. I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in marketing and love it. I've had the chance to work on and complete some really cool projects that I still use for myself in my everyday life. I'm a first-gen immigrant whose parents have grinded their way to a successful life here in the states and am forever grateful for them. Education and grades are my parents #1 priority as they put themselves through 4 yr university with broken English while raising my brother and I, and working all at the same time. I live at home and commute everyday ( if I even go to class ) and I feel like living at home as made it worse because whenever I see my parents there is always a look on their face as if I've done something.

The past couple years I've experienced extreme anxiety and depression shortly after the failed stunt in Europe, seeked help on campus multiple times but to my avail nothing worked / no one seemed to care. My parents are very ""Just do it, if we did it, so you can you"" , but every time I hear that I just feel like the biggest disappointment in the world because I'm hardly passing my classes and am going to have to stay another two semesters. I'm too afraid to ask to go to the doctors because I know that they might think im just making up an excuse. They've provided me with so much and I feel like I'm hardly doing anything in return for them. I love all my friends , get along with everyone, and am very social but something inside of me just doesn't want to live anymore. Every night now for the past two months, I think about how I am going to kill myself ( go to local Walmart, buy a gun, drive to an empty field and shoot myself ) . 

I feel like the biggest piece of shit and am lost right now in my life. I don't know what to do and I am scared/feel worthless. I have this feeling like I've wasted my parents efforts of trying to give me a better life here in the States alongside my brother. I've been planning on ending my life before the new year because I can't bear it anymore. I don't know how many people will see this or read this but I just wanted to get this all off my chest to people I don't know or will never meet."
2684,19 and don’t have any reasons to go on,"i’m 19, not in school and don’t have a job anymore even though i was actively still looking before i gave up hope and just stopped because of my math disability and how terrible i am at counting change and worthless it makes me feel it caused me even more depression....i have no friends and talking to my family would only make me feel more alone. i feel like i disappoint them and that makes me want to harm myself even more than i already do. i’m lonely and i have nobody and no job and nothing to do and i just sit and feel even more depressed and think negatively of myself more times than i can count, i just want to fucking end it so i’m not a burden to my family anymore and so my disability will no longer be a problem  they’ll be fine without me, i have a lot of siblings so they’ll be fine without me, i just want an end."
2685,I can’t take this pain anymore,"My life is ruined. I can’t get anything right and everyone else around me has a good life. I have never gotten any friends irl and I can’t make any, I can’t get a girl friend, I can’t get rid of my social anxiety, no one wants me, online people just keep leaving me, the only online friend I ever had left me 2 months ago and I still miss her, I don’t have any skills that will be useful to my life, I can’t gain any skills, college isn’t preparing me for anything"
2686,the reason I didn't do anything tonight,"I was looking up ways that I could find around the house. Then I freaked out and told my girlfriend. This is what I told her (edited for privacy purposes, anything edited are in asterisks (\*)):

""Like an hour ago I was contemplating a very bad thing. a thing that you would never forgive me for. I tried looking up ways with \*insert different methods, I won't for triggering purposes\*. I'm just so scared of myself right now. I'm so fucking scared and IDK what to do. I'm so sorry for this.

It's not your fault. I'm just so tired of how cruel this world is, how much physical and mental pain I'm in right now. I'm tired of living at home, I want to leave. I want to live so bad. I just can't handle the pain. I want to live, and experience life. I want to experience raising kids and being their role model. I want to experience being a vet and saving animal's lives. I want to experience having a snake. I want to experience sex for the first time. I want to experience life as a whole fucking thing. Right now, it doesn't seem like I'm living a life. I'm just a robot or something, stepping around obstacles and trying not to piss anyone off. I want to experience getting married to you, and having all our partners be our best men or maid of honors because that's how weird we are. I want to get drunk with Russians (inside joke, we're not racist). I want to come home one day with a cat and you end up falling in love with it. I want to live, not just exist. But all I do right now is exist. I love you so much and I wouldn't do this to you but the thoughts are always in the back of my head, and it physically hurts my head when I think about it and tries to hold back my sobs because I could wake \*my dog\*. 

I want to exist with you and \*name of one of my other partners\* and \*my third partner\* and \*her other partner\* and have cats and snakes and dogs and guinea pigs and kids and have road trips and save animals and adopt teenagers and give them a life we never had.""

As I told her these, I realized I was lucky. I had things to live for, so I decided I will. I hope the same thing happens to each and every one of you. You all deserve to live."
2687,I need help but i dont know where to go,Today i went to detention for missing too many classes. The person there gave me a survey and it was one of those stupid ass things like how was your day today from 1 to 10. That question made me realize that i cant remember the last time i had a truly good day. I cant stop thinking about killing myself and i want to stop. Ive asked before on other alternate reddit accounts but nobody replied and im embarrased to ask again even though that thought process is completely illogical and insane but i cant keep doing this. Im a senior in high school in california and i would anonymously seek professional help on my own but im still 17 and dont know if i can do so without my parents or anyone else knowing. I am also deathly afraid of using hotlines because ive heard stuff about them tracing calls or calling police. I am just at a loss right now but what i do know is that i want help.
2688,The person I'm living for doesn't really care about me,"You gave me so much fake sympathy and false hope
Stop making me live for you only for you to treat me so coldly 
why don't you just let me die that would be kinder 

I can't do this anymore.."
2689,im still hopeless and still feel suicidal,"Backtrack:  On November 23, 2019 i attempted suicide by hanging due to stress and feelings of grief, hopelessness, depression, anxiety etc. but it all in all felt like nothing was going to get better and that i continuously hurt myself, someone i love, etc. I always seem to be the one getting hurt by others and manipulated. 

Now, i have had a bf for 2 weeks now so i have been distracted. I am back in that cycle of wanting to die and feeling like no one cares. I feel like im always someones second option &gt; yes this comes from the new relationship as he told me that  he is still talking with his ex and ""refuses to get rid of his d\*\*\*"" meaning they still have sex and not to worry because they havent done it in a year, also saying things like he doesn't care what i do in the relationship. Im sitting here thinking about everything and how i have been hurt again and again.. Im scared of being hurt, im scared of something happening to my family (i dont even know why), im just sick of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\--- sorry for the bad grammar i smoked weed to cope with this shit :)"
2690,Seriously considering suicide.,I know this sounds don’t but a girl I was talking to stopped talking to me and I’m in so much pain I’m seriously thinking about killing myself
2691,I have a friend who recently started asking for a gun in our group chat,"Everyone in the chat was confused at first then we started asking why and he started eluding to suicide. Then I dmed him and tried to talk him out of it. He said that he wouldn't care about anything that happened after he died because he would be dead.  I went to bed for the night and told him I can talk in the morning. In the morning and for the rest of today he hasnt talked to anyone, hasnt been online on discord and hasnt come to school. I'm really worried please someone what should I do."
2692,Im done,"With everything. 
Done with people treating me like I’m stupid. Im done with the lies. I’m done being used. Im done with being the punchbag. 
I don’t know what I did to deserve to much fucking pain but I am done. Universe, God, whatever it is: you win. I can’t do this anymore. I am useless and weak. 
I just want this nightmare to end."
2693,I can’t think of anything in my current state that would make me happy,"Title. It used to be that I could think of things that, if they improved, would be enough to alleviate my desire to end it. But it’s reached the point where none of it matters. I don’t have any desires. I just want out."
2694,Is the crisis textline good or is it as bad as the Suicide Hotline?,I wanna know because idk if I should trust hotlines anymore and idk about the crisis textline. So is it good or bad?
2695,"My house mate tried to kill herself last night in Melbourne, Vic, Australia","\-What do I do?  
\-What happens next?"
2696,I just want to die to escape this life.,"I am under such intense pressure and stress from a combination of work and college along with an intensive and have barely been able to get any sleep. I've been doing better with my suicidal thoughts but my mom called me recently claiming I lied to her about something and is likely going to find some way to punish me emotionally over something I didn't do. After almost a year of no suicidal thoughts. I'm having thousands and think tonight might be perfect for it. 

If there's anybody out there who can even sort of understand me. Please reach out.

I know I want to die but I'm not sure I want it to be like this."
2697,Tonight might be the night,Finals start tomorrow. And all I’ve been doing is saving up my antidepressants and antipsychotics. Idk if I’ll still be here in the morning.
2698,In thinking about ending my useless and wasteful life.,"I'm 14 (will be 15 in 20 days), 6'2, pretty attractive according to some girls at my old school, have a really deep voice, Caucasian, and have brown hair. (Getting to know me) and I'm just not happy with my life.

I live with just my dad. My mom is dead, and my brother and sister live with my grandma. I live in the average household. No fighting ever, me and my dad get along well. But, I feel like I'm a waste of life. I was always bullied in school, and I never did anything but get into fights to stop it. I have the slightest lisp ever, you can only tell if you listen out for the lisp, which it doesn't even happen Everytime. People at my old school exaggerated it so much, and it got to me, it really did. I had no friends, nobody to talk to, my Councilor said I was only looking for attention or empathy when I told him I feel this way, I felt unwanted. I became homeschooled. I get books monthly with about 100 pages in each book (4 books normally). I'll just work all day and finish them all, then the rest of the 29 days, I just watch anime and play World of Warcraft all day. I just can't do anything with my life. I was an honor roll student ever since 6th, and was even able to skip 9th this year and go to 10th. So I'm more sophisticated than the average kid my age, and I did have a bright future before I started getting into fights with kids that would bully me. I was kicked out of honor classes, and my dad went shit on me. He called me the most retarded thing he's ever seen, called me a waste of time and money, and called me a useless bitch for ruining my future just because of a few kids talking shit. That's where this really got bad. I tried to hang myself, but when I dropped myself into the noose and started choking, I wasn't sure what I wanted. I was scared. I fell from the noose, and was alright besides a red mark on my neck. I wanted to die, but why didn't I just stay in the rope. I have absolutely no idea. I can't go to anyone for help, because now the internet craze is that 14 year olds fake depression and being suicidal for attention, so I'm never taken seriously. Ive made a few songs about this, which is how my 8th grade teacher found out, and she did listen. She listened to what I had to say, and talked to me. I love her with all my life, she really did save me. But here I am, questioning my existence again, my ruined future. My pointless life. I have nobody who cares about me tbh. Which, I'm fine with. I don't need anybody if they're just doing it because we're related, or they feel sorry for me.

Sorry for this rant. And there may be alot of spelling errors, I'm shaking pretty badly atm, so sorry for that."
2699,"no one will grieve me when I die, not really","if I were to die tomorrow nobody would actually grieve, the most they'd feel is guilt, guilt for the gossip they spread, guilt for not being better people, guilt for the rumors, the lies, guilt for not seeing the signs, it may even eat them up for a long while afterwards, but nobody will actually care that I died, it'll be all about them and their feelings, I have no one left who genuinely cares for me enough to actually go out of their way before the fact, oddly though, that isn't why I'd do it, I have no specific desire to make anyone suffer, it's just a fact, I'd do it because my life is complete and utter shit and no matter how hard I try I will never form a healthy connection with another human being as long as I live, if I had the energy to do put in the effort at all right now"
2700,The only thing keeping me going right now is my friend's announcement that he's getting married.,"So many of my friends got engaged this year, and one of my friend's recently reached out to let me know he's getting married in the summer.

It's honestly the only thing that's going to keep me going. I want to see him start his new life with the person he loves. He's always been there for me when I needed someone.

It's the first time I've found myself with nothing to really be thankful for, nothing to look forward to... Except that. Not sure what happens after, but at least it's something for now."
2701,Living To Die,"Everyday I think about killing myself. This has been going on for a long time, and I feel like I'm just living to die. I don't have the means to commit suicide. I don't feel motivated and have lost the ability to care. If I could somehow obtain the means to kill myself, I probably would. My life has gotten better, but I've just gotten tired of dealing with all the bullshit. I want to kill myself, but can't so I hope that someday something will just come and kill me. My death would affect a lot of people, but I've gotten to the point where I just don't care. I want to die, but can't kill myself. I'm tired and I don't want to deal with life. That's all."
2702,i'm tired - 12/10/19 - 9:38 pm,"i just want to be able to scream and unwind, let people know what's actually going on with me. it feels like i'm not here anymore. as if i'm just some distraction for everyone to laugh at. i still can't sleep, and my appetite is entirely gone. i feel shitty, and i'm getting migraines from not eating. i can't stop thinking about death and what it would feel like. everyone is leaving, whether by death or by choice. my friends are still poking fun at me, but they also try to get me to eat. i'm conflicted between leaving everyone or staying here just to please them.

all i know, is i'm starting to write a note for if i ever do anything."
2703,what are your ways of coping and keeping yourself stable?,"after almost going through with an attempt almost 2 years ago, suicide has became more hard to handle if spoken about. my emotions go haywire and i can’t seem to control them if the topic ever comes up since it brings me back to the day where my mental health was so horrible that i almost couldn’t handle living with it anymore.  maybe i need to move on and let go of the past but i’m not sure how to...
i can control my emotions when i talk about my own experience but it seems as though it’s way more difficult to do so if i wasn’t ready for the topic, it just makes my eyes water and it’s hard to not cry. i really don’t want to become a mess on the floor if it ever happens, it almost happened awhile back and that was not a fun experience.
what are your ways of coping and keeping yourself stable?"
2704,I Feel Useless,"I just... I feel like crap every day. My boyfriend is amazing and cares for me but I feel like his love could be redirected to someone who deserves it. He keeps saying he'd rather spend a night listening to my issues that 10 minutes listenimg to my euology. But I doubt that... He doesn't know how bad things get. He doesn't know about the bullying, about my extended family. Nothing... I tell him I trust him and I do... But settings I couldn't bring myself. To tell him... Like how I want to KMS every damn day."
2705,Dont feel so good,"I've tried suicide about 9 times now, in different ways, and I'm currently 14. I have a severe nut allergy so I always try to eat them. I wish I was born male, being transsexual sucks. I'm starting to have trouble feeling emotions, but I'm not entirely emotionally numb yet. I wish my parents liked me. I wish someone cared for me. Sorry for the vent."
2706,I haven't eaten or drunk anything for the past 3 days.,"I stopped eating and drinking entirely as a means of suicide. I mostly chose this way as a means of proving resolve to myself. I haven't actually experienced any hunger or thirst though, it seems really weird to me that I haven't experienced any complications with daily activities either. I took my finals and had no trouble focusing, even did pretty well on all of them. I kinda feel like I stopped liking life from a lack of conflict, to the point where I try to create my own problems to handle. I have no trouble with school or social life, so it's pretty much all I could come up with for why I'm doing this. Sharing cause I'm bored and thought someone might find it odd/interesting but using a throwaway so friends don't find my reddit account and take action."
2707,this is my final note,i’m sorry
2708,I've decided,"just wanted to put this out in to world that I've decided that if I fail my math final I will die .. because that means I'm being held back yet another year .. I'll never hear the end of it from my parents and Frankly I dont think I could do it anymore I'm not where i pictured myself to  be I'm exhausted  and I love my degree I love learning I just lost all motivation I never acquired the discipline it's too late I wasted all opportunities I have no friends no one is going to miss me but my parents but they'll get over it .. i have 3 more final exams left .. I'm going to do my best I could .. I had one today and it was so easy to get an A .. and I shouldve started studying earlier .. and i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself 

**I know it seems dramatic but I do base my worth on my grades and if I dont make good grades I wont get a good job that I like and what's the point of living then ? Like I said I dont have friends .. the only thing that prevented me for so long was that I was embarrassed because I live in a small town and yeah ... I know initially everyone will be like 'oh that's sad &amp; why etc etc ' but that's just one day compared to my next 40 + yrs of misery"
2709,i cant keep doing this,"the whole life thing, it just seems so pointless. ive been through quite a lot. in my opinion, ive been through enough. i dont know what im gonna do. the thought of killing myself has crossed my mind a lot recently and ive done my best to ignore it but its always there, in the back of my mind. i cant shake it. ive even noticed me acting much more impulsively lately. without even thinking i try and do something that could hurt me, and ive been lucky its only been little things every now and then. giving myself a small paper cut for example. i have a rubber band on my wrist that i flick myself with whenever the thought crosses my mind and it seems to be helping so i guess i'll do that untill it doesnt stop me. theres so much to write so i guess i'll stop being a little bitch and end this here.

tl;dr, im really heckin sad"
2710,Never enough,"Sometimes it feels no matter how hard I try in life it will just continue to be difficult, long, and hard for me so why continue on? I am about to graduate college with my BA and have been accepted into grad school. As a prospective teacher i am told it will be hard to get a job and I’ll never make a lot of money. This is on top of the fact that I have over 30,000 in student loans. and now grad school to get through. I work and have an internship and yet I’m constantly being told there’s more and more i should be doing. I have a really weak to non existence relationship with my father and my mother is too busy with her husband and three kids to focus on her grown 21 year daughter. I’ve felt more and more distance from my friends as college is coming to an end. At night I am constantly traumatized by nightmares that recall sexual and physical abuse I received has a child and in a bad relationship with an ex boyfriend. I have trust and abandonment issues and through of all this I have tried so hard to persevere but I’m at my wits end. I know it’s so easy to feel you’re not good enough but I honestly don’t see the point of continuing what has been a hard life for me . Maybe I should stop feeling sorry for myself, after all everyone suffers, but i just can’t hell but feel it would be better to end it all."
2711,I’ll commit suicide February 21st if my life doesn’t change drastically for the better. I don’t know if I’ll do it. But knowing I have a date makes me feel more relaxed about life,"It takes away any pressure I’ve put upon myself or have from others. Because I know wether I do so or not (expectations) that’ll all go to waste because I’ll die soon. It also kind of makes me want to do everything I can before I go. I already thought of how I’m gonna do it, and is it weird to say I’m excited? I feel relaxed knowing I don’t have to live through life anymore."
2712,Go big or go home.,"If you want to go out, I’d go out in the most epic way. For instance, I’d get a credit card with a high limit and use it to buy a parachute, some rope, a cinder block, and one-way ticket to Vegas. When I got there I’d rent a fast convertible and get an assault rifle. Id use the gun to shoot blanks in the air near the police station and then drive away fast. Toss the gun out of the car and the chase is on! When the cops tail me into the desert with the news choppers above, my time has come. That’s when I’d put the noose around my neck and tie the end other end of the rope to the steering column. I’d place the cinderblock on the gas pedal, stand up and pull the parachute. My neck snapped at the end of the rope and my lifeless body is now on TV parasailing through the desert. 

For some extra bonus points, I might set the car on fire just before I  jumped, or write “Ron Paul 2004” on the parachute or wear crotchless fur suit when I did it."
2713,My best friend was almost killed in a shooting,It just makes me loathe everything even more. He was feet away from the shooting in Jersey City today. I hate everything. Why is the world like this. I don't want to live in it anymore.
2714,Loneliness,"Writing this mainly to vent

Lately I've just been feeling so alone. I've always been alone, not just now, ever since highschool started I was bullied by the entire class for the duration of it, but I managed to go through it, even though that was the time I've most wanted to kill myself. I guess the hope of things somehow turning for the better and videogames were what kept me going.

Ironically though, now that I'm at the best position I've ever been (Have no constant harrassing and managed to get a job) is when it's the most clear to me, I simply have nothing to keep living for.

I haven't had a friend since basically never, I'm a complete stranger to my family, and I'm terrified of talking to people.

When I start thinking about how lonely my life will be, I just have no desire to keep going. What I most want are friends, but that's just impossible for me.

I've read a lot about trying to make friends, but I'm too afraid to talk to people in the first place, not even online. And the people ""closest"" to me (Co-workers) are fully disinterested in me.

I'm almost 20 now, it's been 4 years since I got out of highschool and the constant harrassment stopped and it's been a year since got a job, yet I'm just as lonely as I've always been, but now I'm hopeless, and know that things will stay the same.

I've been considering suicide for a while now, and if it were easier to get a gun in my country I probably would've done it already, but all the other options are really scary to me.

I just don't want to keep on living in this limbo of loneliness."
2715,The more I think about it the more I realize that I’ve been abused by most people in my life in one way or another,"I was abused by my dad and bullied in high school. I already tried killing myself once when I was 16. I’m 20 now, and nothing has changed. My now ex-girlfriend would constantly manipulate me and tell me what I was doing wrong. When we broke up she would say that I was such a bad guy, and even my own brother took her side. I just don't see the point in remaining alive. People will always say in anti-suicide PSA's that people care about you but won't ever ask why someone wants to die so bad. 

Most people are bad people at heart and will cross you just to get ahead. 99% of the people I've interacted with have abused me, broken my trust, or acted in otherwise malicious ways towards me. That's the one truth that I learned in my 20 years alive on this earth. Why let it continue? I'm studying for finals but what for? I seriously can't imagine being alive 5 years from now."
2716,I’m Considering suicide,"I’m a full time student with 21k in credit card debt and 8k in loans so far, on top of that I need to help my mom pay for the house. I’ll run out of money in 10 day from now, after that I won’t be able to pay any bills.  And I’ll just be punished with more fees in higher apr. since the stress will basically kill me, I need to end this torture."
2717,Confused,"I'm really confused as to whether I'm actually suicidal or not, I don't want to die and I love my life, but I keep doing things that might result in death if I follow through

I will be walking my dog, kinda feeling a little bit anxious and then for some reason I start tying the dog lead into a noose and I go and find a tree and then sling the lead over a branch and then I stand there for a while, pull the lead down again and go home

The whole time I'm screaming at myself in my head telling me to stop, but I just feel like I'm in a trance and can't stop until the decision to follow through comes up 

I think I'm going to tell my therapist about this next appointment, but in the meanwhile, can anyone relate or does anyone know wth I'm doing???"
2718,My thoughts eat me,"Like a five course meal
I don’t taste good
Like potatoes and veal 
They spit me out
Step on me hard
Every day,
Twisting my heart

My thoughts eat me

I treat no one right 
Horrible person me
I want to die
I’m just too scared 
My only wish;
That someone cared"
2719,"Why are people who are extroverts and all over the top happy (basically the people that make my existance painful and make me want to die) have an upper hand in society? I know I have the same opportunities, but I have to suffer way more?","This is not fair! The people praised in society are these extroverted women and men who constantly seem to be happy. If I tried to be them, I would have horrible anxiety and probably pass out or something. I really hate the position I'm in, I have potential and I know what to do theoretically, but it never happens in action and I'm scared as fuck to approach people, especially women. Idk if life seems worth it with this in mind, I'm also lazy as hell and have to idea what to do in my life. If I go walking around the parj, the only people who approach me are fucking mormons. Help me."
2720,I want it to be over so badly.,"I lost almost all my friends. Everyone leaves me eventually. I have no one to talk to right now, after feeling indescribably terrible all day, I have no direction. No passions, no aspirations, I just feel hopeless. I'm not close with anyone but my boyfriend anymore, they all get tired of me. It's my fault. I just want to be loved. I want to be loved so badly, but I'm all by myself again, crying, wishing I would just end my life already. I'm tired of the suicide hotlines, I'm tired of trying to get help. I just keep getting worse."
2721,What's the point,"I moved to a new city last year to study here, I still have no friends here. I hate my field of study even though I have good grades, Yesterday I skipped all my classes and stayed in bed all day because getting out of bed felt so fucking pointless. What's even the point of being alive if I have no purpose."
2722,Is there anybody I can talk to,I just need somebody
2723,I'm trash,I'm an angry suicidal entitled little bitch. I deserve to die because everyone is against me.
2724,What to do about suicidal urges?,"After a while of job searching I had a breakdown, and am now in the bathroom trying to figure out the best way to end it. This happens a few times a month. I'm looking for a way to get this under control, because I fear it will only get worse as I have absolutely nothing to live for. I have no passion or will to live at all, adulthood is hell and from what I've heard it's only going to get worse.

So I'm trying to figure out what to do because it's just been a continuous cycle of me trying to improve my life, failing, being suicidal and picking myself back up and doing it all over again. I'm tired of life and want out immediately, and I know I'm going to do it if I don't find something. I don't see my counselor for another month and I can't wait that long. My family is emotionally unavailable. The hotline hung up on me. I've tried walking and stuff but it ultimately just feels like a bandaid- life and adulthood will still be shitty afterwards. I cannot keep going like this."
2725,If I had a method I was comfortable with...,"I’d be gone and out of here. I’ve considered overdosing or jumping off a tall building/bridge, and I once tried intentional alcohol poisoning. If there’s a convenient way I’m not thinking of, please let me know."
2726,I just want to be absolved of my Earthly experience,"I can't do this anymore. I do not believe I have the power to make my life better or more enjoyable. I am not capable of seeing this any other way. I am not capable of feeling good about life. Everything is so bleak...and I am so fucking sick of having to do everything the way other people want it done. At my fucking job is mostly where I have a problem with this. I just do not feel happy to be working where I am. I'm not happy to deal with people for hours every day. I'm not fucking happy I am at risk of injury at the job I'm at. For fucking what? Fucking pennies. What the fuck. 

I can't do any of this anymore. All I have ever wanted in my adult life is to smoke weed and eat what I want. I don't give a single absolute shit about anything else. I've seen the true nature of life and it is SHIT. I don't understand how I'm suppose to even be *willing to try* to keep a cool head. I don't see the fucking point. I'm fucking sick of having to keep a cool head, because my head's not fucking cool, ever, and all I see are reasons to absolutely resent other people and life in general. 

There are no doors opening for me. I'm going to end up homeless because I'm not smart enough to effectively plan, think, or figure problems out. I don't want to be. I'm fucking sick of problem solving. I was fucking done with it years before I took the last math class I was forced to take in high school. I'm not willing to be in the military, because fuck that and fuck being in a world where the consequences of not doing what some stupid fuck tells you to do gets you in deep shit. I'm not willing to be a cop. I'm not willing to be a nurse. I'm not really willing to be anything anymore. There is nothing I want to be. Nobody I want to help. I don't have values anymore and holding on to values or morality is not something I can burden myself with anymore. 

I'm fucking sick of it all. And most importantly, I'm fucking sick of the fact that the only way for doors to open in life is to socialize with fucking people. I'm fucking sick of working with people, because you can't ignore them without them being upset and not liking you. Fuck all of this shit. I'm sick of seeing the goddamn necessity of building relationships in my fucking face every day. I don't want to think about the fucking consequences of alienating every fucking person that comes into my life. It would be great if everyone could burn in nuclear devastation. Myself included, I don't know. I'm never going to be okay to willing to play life's fucking game. I just want to blow the fuck up, but there is nothing to destroy. I want to destroy then I want to die. Why? Why can't I just fucking murder the menace making life shit? Because the menace IS LIFE. I wish I was never fucking born. I have wished I was never born plenty of times before and I'm on a three year fucking hot streak. 

I will never stop ignoring life. I just wish it was easier to buy a handgun in this piece of shit state. When I die I won't have a fucking plan. I'm just going to do it when the mood fits. To just walk out into the woods with my piece loaded and ready, kneel down, and take one last breath; the breath of final release. I pull the trigger and let myself slip away. This is my only dream. This is my 9nly fantasy."
2727,I’m having ideation again &amp; I’m scared,"I’ve been having my regular depression shit going on in the winter for a few weeks but it’s been getting worse. I went on a walk &amp; called my little sister &amp; was going to apologize to her for how I’ve been isolating myself. She was at a friends house &amp; couldn’t talk, asked if I needed something &amp; I said no &amp; hung up. My boyfriend is asleep &amp; has been for a few hours, he sometimes sleeps all day when he’s been gaming all night &amp; has been sick lately. He hasn’t really talked to me for more than a few hours lately bc of work &amp; school. He’s awesome but sucks at talking me through shit like this. His brother died last summer &amp; I don’t want to bother him with my shit.


I was crying this weekend about how a picture someone posted of me online was breaking me bcause I looked fat &amp; I don’t feel fat or look fat in the mirror. I’m so scared of relapsing into my pit of being self esteem-less and wanting to die. I feel like its coming again &amp; the thought alone is bringing me so much anxiety &amp; I feel like its an endless cycle of recovery then slipping again &amp; I just want it to stop.


I have no friends except my boyfriend. My family is supportive but lives 3 hours away. I have a new full time job out of college &amp; I’m financially okay but i feel like I’m so alone &amp; isolated. I feel like no one understands but ik thats not true. Really, I feel like no one is helping or able to help me &amp; that makes me feel the most alone. I’m not going to do it tonight but I’m so scared of that part of me that just wants to die. At least this thme I don’t feel ugly."
2728,in outpatient and wanting to kill myself because i “can’t” talk about something,"okay, first off the thing that i want to talk about i technically could talk about it BUT i’m pretty sure the therapists, MHS’s or my doctor at the program would have to report it because i’m a minor. i briefly mentioned something similar to my therapist i saw before i started this outpatient program, but i didn’t tell her about what i want to talk about. i told her in the past that when i’ve been impulsive i would post “risqué” things on an app with the intention that people would respond to me; which of course they did, and i would generally respond to a couple of people out of the 85 or so that had messaged me. after i was no longer impulsive i would block all of the people that messaged me(and reporting some of the people that had sent me explicit photos without my consent). i also told her the main reason for posting was to see from those situations/conversations if i could find someone to meet up with. ALSO i told her that if someone were outside of my house at that moment, or close to where i lived, i probably would’ve had sex with them- these are guys over the age of 18 mind you. i then told her that i had never taken any further actions than just talking and that the most personal information people had of me was the state i lived in. at the time that was true, but later things changed. one day i was impulsive, went on the app and posted something- yada yada yada- but after taking down the post and blocking everyone, i continued to talk to someone. someone that right off the bat i told them my age. we exchanged other social media information and began to talk on those apps. some other facts are that he has offered to buy me sex toys, to give me weed, we’ve talked about meeting up, and i have sent him pictures of myself. i’m scared to talk about it because i don’t want my parents to find out, which i’m assuming they will because i’m assuming the police will get involved(another reason why i am scared) i am fucking terrified that i’ll have to press charges or he’ll press charges against me bc i sent pictures of myself/i put him in a position where he is in possession of child pornography. another aspect that is making me more suicidal is the fact that he told me(he claimed) he had a 16 year old girlfriend a couple of years ago- and a couple of years ago still would have been illegal seeing that he is 38 years old(or so he claims). a big part of me feels obligated to tell someone bc he is talking to me(a 16 year old) and had a 16 gf not too long ago. i only know his first name, and where he lives(or has claimed to live in). i am also scared and stressed and suicidal bc idk if he is a pedohile, if he’s a danger to the community, or just likes talking to mature teenagers(typing that out sounds stupid to me now but it’s just how i feel and i’m so fucking confused). what if he’s just a nice guy and some fucking 16 year old girl responding to his response to her post ruins his life???? this is stressing me out so much. i’m so scared. i love my program, and i love the staff there. i want to talk to them about this all but i’m also so afraid that they’ll think i’m disgusting."
2729,I’m trying so hard to get better,"To start off, if I could only receive constructive comments and no “I relate to that”, “I feel the same way” etc because I can’t handle the weight of other people’s struggles right now, because I can’t even handle my own. Thank you

I’ve deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember. My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age 3. There’s never really been anything bad happening in my life. It’s always been within me. Which makes it even harder sometimes, because unlike a certain event or situation, you will always be with yourself and your thoughts. I’ve been in therapy since 7th grade (I’m now in 10th), but I definitely could’ve used it sooner. 

I’ve been through many ups and downs in the past 2 years, and I recently came out as transgender (female to male) which has made my life so much more complicated. I lost my friends since childhood, and then another group of friends. I stopped going to traditional public school this year. I’ve self harmed, been clean, and relapsed. I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer. 

Everyone says I’ve been making really good progress over the years, but I’ve never been this close to suicide on a daily basis. I can’t deal with my gender identity, I’m constantly doubting wether I’m trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria. I’m disassociating really hard every day (I’ve experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense), I don’t even recognize my face, body, voice, or even the things I say or the way I act. I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being. Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I can’t even comprehend who’s thoughts they are. I’ve stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it, it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless. I’ve always felt like there’s something else wrong with me that hasn’t been diagnosed, but maybe that’s the hypochondria. Thus far I’ve only been diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD, and Depression. I haven’t self harmed in awhile, but it’s just because I know it doesn’t really help and hurts those around me. 

The only way I can describe it is that I’m a cicada. I have a shell on the outside that I’ve shed a few times, but now I’m stuck in one shell. I no longer exist to the outside world, just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last. I don’t even feel like a person anymore. I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level. I’ve been on autopilot for so long. I’ve tried to get better for so long. I can’t remember a time that I wasn’t mentally struggling. It feels like life will never be different for me, it’s like that’s just how god designed me. 

I’m tired of people telling me “it’ll get better”, “it won’t be like this forever”, “you can keep going”. This is all I’ve ever known. Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok. And I can’t see any possible way out. No matter where I go, or where I run, the problem is in my head. I can’t escape it. I can only distract from it for a short amount of time. I can’t even remember to eat sometimes now. I forget to do the most basic things. I can never make decisions, so I’m probably not gonna kill myself anyway. It’s too much to plan and I know I’ll probably forget something important. It’s permanent and drastic, and I don’t do well with making permanent drastic decisions. 

I’m just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days, or I’ll suddenly realize something, or I’ll find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to ask questions, even if they’re personal. I’m desperate."
2730,Dec. 15th,"    Sunday, December 15th, I'm going to kill myself.
I've been going back and forth for years now and  it's time. 
    Even my own family agrees with me and tells me to my face, it'd be better if was dead.

    Idk what I wanted to get out of this, just needed to say bye ig"
2731,"Hey, I need some support please","Hey, my name is Gabriel, i am in my later years of highschool, and I just hate life, genuinely. Let me start fo the story, so I was raised in a very dysfunctional family, my dads a alcoholic who is emotionally abusive, I was raised with three older brothers that used to hurt me physically and insult me, by the age of 8 I was already wanting to kill myself, I was just to scared to do it. At the age of 13, a I believe is when I developed mental illnesses (I’m not sure if that’s how it works) but anyways, I was violent, I wanted to kill myself, and other, for no reason, I just wanted someone to feel for me, but no one did, and I guess the violent thoughts towards others just went away, but i was still always suicidal,  the only thing that made me happy was my dog mac, he was my everything, last year got hit by a car and died, I’ve never been more heartbroken, it killed me, nothing good has happend sense, other than when I met my girlfriend (ex now, I’ll explain in a sec) and this was a few months ago, but we met and vibed so well, I felt like I could have loved her,  and then, she decided to cheat on me, for the whole time we were dating, and that killed me also, recently the bullying has stopped sense I’m well known for my good weights numbers (I’m a big guy, 5’11 175 pounds) big for a junior ig, that was off topic but I think that’s why I’m not bullied but idk, anyways, I started to go to therapy recently, and they say I have many mental illnesses, and I need medication, my mom refused, so now I’m here, just, existing, I wake up not thinking it’s gonna be a good day, not even a ok day, I wake up cause my body does it naturally, I have things to be thankful for, I’m muscular and relatively attractive, but that’s all, nothing else, also friends ig, I just need a person to help."
2732,Every aspect of my life is telling me I need to kill myself,"I feel like the universe wants me dead. I've been cheated on, found out the person I loved most in the world never gave a shit about me, couldn't find a job before graduating and had to move back in with my parents.

A couple years ago two of my closest friends died unexpectedly, followed by my grandma and my childhood pet, all within 6 months. Within the same week of my best friend dying from an overdose, my partner broke up with me for not being fun or positive enough. 

When I found my most recent partner, I thought my whole life was finally on track. He made me feel loved and important, told me I was beautiful, and made me feel safe. But after two years together, I found out he had been cheating on me for nearly our entire relationship. When we broke up it became clear to me that he never really loved me. 

Now I'm unemployed, broke and alone.  I am also extremely unnatractive and have a hard time making friends because of this. I have no tits and I look like a dude, even when wearing makeup. What man would ever want me?

I feel like suicide is the only logical option here. I'm not religious, but clearly some greater power wants me dead, right? I have tried my whole life to be a kind and empathetic person, but in return people are cruel to me or at best pretend I don't exist.

I'm not sure that I want to die, but I feel like I have to. This world is an evil place and I will never be happy here. Wouldn't you kill yourself if you were me?"
2733,I dont want this anymore,"I'm so far behind everyone else socially. I haven't had friends for a long long time.

I just want one deep connection. Just one person I can hang out with. Man, if I had a girlfriend I could just spend a ton of time with, I'd be fine.

I feel like I was meant to die randomly years ago, but there was a mistake and I lived, so now my life is just on autopilot going nowhere."
2734,Help,"I’ve had ~6 failed suicide attempts in the past two months, mostly slitting my wrist but two overdoses that didn’t work. I’m still cutting constantly. My parents love me and I used to be doing well in school but now I’m failing some classes. I have a bunch of friends but yet I still always feel so alone. I hate almost everybody I know. Everyone I trust has betrayed me. People lie so much and it hurts. Constant pain, heartbreak. I used to be somebody that was able to make my friends happy, someone that seemed a little crazy but smart. Now I’ve just been somebody who ruins the mood because I’m always sad and depressed. I just make everybody feel worse. Even though I have so many people that want to help me, I still fucking hate myself. I hate so much about my life. Every second feels so painful. I want to kill myself so much it’s unbearable. I can’t be fixed. I can’t be helped. Nothing makes me consistently happy anymore besides my best friend.  I can’t do any school work anymore because I can’t focus in class, my appetite is all fucked up, and I no matter what I do I just want to die. I’m still seeing a therapist, and I’ve been to a psychiatric unit for depression. I can’t take it anymore. I feel so hollow inside. My personality always just switches up seemingly out of nowhere I don’t even know who I am anymore. I don’t know what to do."
2735,I will be killing myself soon.,Soon I will be preparing to kill myself. I am not supposed to be alive anymore. There is no point in continuing my existence. I hate reality and I hate the cards I was dealt. Goodbye.
2736,I feel like I’m living in the final days,
2737,How to tell parents you attempted suicide without makimg them feel responsible?,"Just took a bunch of extrastrength tylenols and regret it, wondering how to tellvl my parents because if i go to the hospital it'll probably be in their insurance"
2738,Killing my self in a few days.,
2739,i feel empty,this probably sounds very cliche but seriously. my friendships are bullshit. my relationship with my family is bullshit. i have no social life. i have worked dead end jobs for the amount of time i have lived on this planet. i am trying to everything in my willpower. life is not fulfilling for a person like me; bitter and mad at the world. i must be selfish to want a decent life
2740,"Debating if death, homelessness, or a terrible job is the best option.","I went to school my whole life, got a couple of useless degrees, got out and unsurprisingly couldn't handle the real world.

I've been unemployed three years now and I've accepted a retail job. I used to have one, it was honestly soul crushing, so I know exactly how bad it'll be. I slept all the time I didn't work. There's no point to living like that. 

Since I'm actually a giant baby who can't handle basic shit, I've now got a few days to decide if dying is the best option. I'm probably just going to do it. I hate everything."
2741,I made a blog a while back and every entry for the past 5 years have been about my depression and suicide attempts.,"I found this blog again, and I'm baffled that I'm still alive. 

An excerpt from my first entry August 2015:

""Sadly, I’m going through a period of my life where happiness doesn’t happen often enough.  Like so many, I am struggling with a form of mental instability that  leaves me physically and mentally exhausted every waking moment.""

Second entry May 2016:

"" In just 6 months, I went from being an extremely happy person who had  just returned from a year abroad to a person who attempted suicide only a  few days into 2016.   I was foolish for not seeking help before it got out of hand. I should  have reached out when I began to notice myself having more PTSD related nightmares and began having suicidal thoughts. I will always regret the  past, but I can’t change what I did now.""

Third entry February 2017:

"" I’ve been in college for several months now and I have had a blast.  Throughout all the hard and frustrating study sessions, fruitless nights  of procrastination, and all the drama with my friends, I’ve stayed  remarkably positive. Sure, I still have issues with my mental illness  such as passive suicidal ideation. I won’t do it though.""

Fourth entry June 2018:

""I did really well for a while. I felt semi-normal for the first time in a  long time. I was working so hard to fight the depression monster that  likes to linger. It didn’t last. There was another monster creeping up  on me, slowly growing and soon it engulfed me. That monster was bulimia.""

Fifth entry January 2019: 

""I was trying desperately to keep my head above water, but instead I was  starting to drown. I spiraled farther and farther into that void that  threatened every moment of every day to overpower me.""

Latest entry, today:

""I was doing better, but I’m not anymore. It’s been literal years since I  started feeling this way. I don’t want to have this pain anymore.""

&amp;#x200B;

How many more years will I struggle? Maybe I shouldn't even fight it anymore. I'm tired of losing."
2742,片翼の天使,"I am the one winged angel, the one who owns all right to this planet. Death will render my flesh useless, I will be reborn as god. This world is in constant disarray, but soon you will all be part of my collective consciousness."
2743,please help me,i cant stop crying im crying so hard WHY WONT ANYONE HELP ME????
2744,"How many thousands of us want to stop living, and how many serial killers out there are looking for their next victim? Why not do the world a favor and KILL two birds with one stone?",
2745,I occasionally remember this blog exists. It shows 5 years of painful updates. I'm not sure I can do it anymore.,[https://wordpress.com/post/diaryofdonie.wordpress.com/27](https://wordpress.com/post/diaryofdonie.wordpress.com/27)
2746,Don’t feel like anyone cares about me,"Hi. I hope I don’t seem like I’m bring attention seeking or anything. I just feel really sad and lonely and I kind of want to send my thoughts out in the world in the hopes that someone might read it. Hope that's ok

I felt sad so I went to take a shower to be by myself. As I was waiting for the water to get hot my mom came in. She asked me if I had any pencils. I guess for context lately I’ve been stabbing myself with mechanical pencils sometimes. I can’t really explain why. It makes me feel different when I feel upset. I said no, which was true. To be completely honest I had wanted to get one, but didn’t because my backpack was where my mom was and I didn’t want to get caught. She said ok and left. Once the shower was ready I went in and sat on the floor of the shower. Because you know, it was more to be alone than to get clean. I was like that for a few minutes when my mom came in again and asked if I was OK. I said yes. She said OK and left. This made me feel a bit bad because she must have been peeking through the door and spying on me to see me sitting on the floor and get concerned.

This is what I can't wrap my head aroubd. She knows enough to ask if I'm going to hurt myself, yet doesn't make an effort to talk to me about what I think about or what's going on mentally. I want to hurt myself. I want to kill myself. At this point I'm thinking about it constantly. She doesn't care about that. She cares about whether I hurt myself outwardly, or whether I'm getting my work done. So it kind of feels like she doesn't genuinely care about how I'm feeling. Only whether it's going to affect me physically or in terms of work which would in turn make her look bad.

I don't really have anyone else to talk to. It doesn't seem like anyone really takes the way I feel seriously. They're more concerned with my work getting done. I'm getting so tired lately it feels almost physically straingin to have to go to school. I beg the guidance counselor to let me stay there. No one listens. It kind of feels like I just can't get a break. And at this point I don't know how much more I can take this. I really want to die. But I'm weak willed. And stupid. I can't find a way to die or bring myself to do certain things. I'm thinking that means things aren't as bad as I think they are. I don't know. But weirdly that makes me feel worse because Di just get confused over whether why I feel the way I do if it's not true. If that make sense.

I know all that probably didn't make sense. I just wanted to say it. I guess I'm not being completely honest whrnni say no one care s about me. I'm with my cat right nowml and that makes kenfeel better. Though a cat isn't a person and he doesn't actually care about my thoughts. I wish someone did."
2747,Minding the darkness,"I finally have my own place, with a nice yard to garden in.. a futon to sleep on, a cat to love. Currently I am not working, I want to get on at the lab Nathan’s dad works at but 1) I still don’t have a car and 2) I have zero to little actual data for my research projects so I am working on those things. All day I spend reading, writing, meditating and feeling completely listless. I don’t WANT a job. I hardly leave the house, only to get cigarettes or food or busk for money. Sometimes, a few friends come over and we drink a couple beers and play poker while discussing science shit. This is seemingly the life I’ve always wanted... I’ve been showering and taking real good care of myself physically not so much mentally. Even though I’ve always known the steps to take to pull myself out of this depression actually applying my methods seems impossible. Something is just gnawing away at my will to live and every year it just gets worse. One would think having a rebalanced brain chemistry from sobriety would just fix everything but that isn’t the case. Maybe my serotonin receptors are just shot .. whatever the case, everyday i wake up and think “this is the day. Today I will end this crap so I can reincarnate and start all over, in a non disfigured and traumatized body.” And that’s my first fuxking thought everyyy day, it used to be getting high. It used to be Andi. It used to be God. Now it’s just suicide. 
The suicide hotline people probably have me on speed dial, because it’s easier to call them than a doctor or my loved ones. Doctors have a tendency to misdiagnose and l don’t want empty sentiments, or worse... condescension from loved ones. I don’t really even want to talk about it but I know from experience that it’s whenever I don’t verbalize these thoughts they turn into actions. I realised about two weeks ago whenever I gave away my bass and my tent (my two prized possessions) shit was getting real. People tend to do that before going through with taking ones life, it’s a subtle indication kind of a will and testament. Man. Thanks for listening ... I know it’s a sensitive subject. You and Alex are the ones I feel secure in telling this to, I wish I could tell everyone and anyone I can about my tendencies but I’m afraid people don’t want to hear it. But you, you understand... and know the importance of reaching out so thank you soooo much dude. I’m applying the twelve step principles to life and taking it one day at a time. After those thoughts plague my waking I can only distract myself, refocus my amygdala until it passes. I had a vision last week that I was living at my parents and paralyzed, a complete vegetable. My dad walked in the room with a Busch 24 in his hand and said, “sorry, princess. I heard you I was just telling the boy [i guess my brother,] goodbye.” But my dad had this LOOK. I can’t describe it, it was like... scared. Sad. Feigning being alright. His eyes were hurt- Like some proverbial line had been crossed and there was no going back. My best guess is that I attempted suicide but instead of complete shutdown I had had a stroke, leaving me permanently disabled. That would be the only reason my dad would ever enable me to drink again, is if he really felt sorry for me and knew there was no chance of me having a life. That’s fucking crazy to think about. It’s like the universe saying “even if you tried, you would lose. You need to live with this.” Fuxking snarky ass universe."
2748,Grades came in. I failed. I let everyone down. I'd rather end it now and move on to something bigger and better than my pathetic excuse for a life because I'm too big of a pussy to face the people rooting for me and let them know that I'm a total failure of a human being who can't do anything right,"I feel like the title explains it better than a long drawn out story.

How much could mental health help? I'm already seeing a therapist and psyhiatrist and went through inpatient treatment over the summer. Clearly the common denominator in all this is me just not having what it takes to life."
2750,Think I'll disappear on vacation,Take a week off and just ever come back. Jump off a cruise maybe. Feel like my mom will be less sad if they never find my body.
2751,"To the people who read my post, gave me the kick in the ass I needed and also worried over whether I had killed myself; this is for you.","
You were all right.

I deleted my post because of one downvote that may or may not have been accidentally hit while scrolling then went on a rant in another. 
Was it ridiculous? Yes.
Did I go overboard with my reaction? Yes.
Am I able to look at that post without cringing? _No_.

I came to this sub at the worst time I could have- when I was in crisis.

I woke up in Hospital that afternoon with no recollection of what happened, my husband crying and a lot of message notifications from Reddit of all places. I was disoriented, embarrassed and most of all- disappointed. When I finally went through my post I realised what I had done, and how I had let myself go so deep that a simple downvote set me off. One that probably wasn’t intentional.

I am alive. I am recovering. I am also sorry for losing my marbles here like that when it is something I wouldn’t have done if I were in a better place.

I told you all I would never come to this sub again, but if I didn’t come back I wouldn’t have seen how out of character and mind my psychosis had made me. I wouldn’t have been able to connect pieces together with my therapist of my night and realised how I have a tendency to find something negative to push me that much further. 

Overall my advice to you is to not come here when you’re in crisis. Create a safety plan with someone you trust. Come here when you need advice from likeminded people or to hear others stories you can learn from. That’s when this sub really helps me."
2752,I’m back here again,"Well I don’t have anyone to turn to right now so back to this fucking subreddit. I was doing good for about a few days. I told my parents I’m suicidal and that I was cutting myself and so they made me an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist but she could do anything so they sent me to a therapist and then my school counselor got word of this and started seeing more in school. Then I had an appointment today with another therapist but the therapist couldn’t take me so now I’m struggling to find a new therapist and this whole thing is stressing me out. I’m now starting to get those suicidal feelings and urges to cut myself again but I feel like nobody cares or people don’t want to deal with me and I don’t know what the fuck to do when I’m falling back into that deep depression spiral. 

You know what I want to kill myself and nobody cares and I’m glad nobody cares because tbh it makes it easier for me to kill myself. I don’t want anyone else to be hurt I’m tired of constantly always hurting the ones I love on a day to day basis. I know they’re hurting on the inside because of me I know they all hate me and they want me to fucking die and guess what soon they’ll get what they want. Nobody actually cares they show fake empathy because they pitty me and treat me like a lost fucking child. Well great at least I know that people show pitty because they just feel bad and not actually care. I’m sorry but I’m done I’m saying goodbye sooner or later. I can’t be bothered to take people’s fake empathy when I know they’re doing it out of pitty. I’m being torn apart here I don’t know what else to do I’m so fucking exhausted I want to kill my self in any way possible."
2753,Future.,I cannot see into the future. I cannot see a life with me in it. When I think about the future and what it holds for me I just see hey black space. I really can't see what my future holds for me. it seems that no matter how much I think I've changed from the person I used to be I will never change enough and I will always be the person I hate so much. I just want someone to crash into me or for me to get hit by a stray bullet because when or if that happens I will not fight to stay here. I'll just let myself go.
2754,I want to to tell my younger brothers they keep me from killing myself but I don’t know how,"I never told my brothers I was / am suicidal but I want to tell them how much they mean to me and I don’t know how. I’m 21. One is about an adult who I think I could tell, but the other one is barely a tween and I definitely couldn’t tell him. I just want to wrap my arms around them and tell them how much they mean to me."
2755,I can’t be here anymore,"I feel every day I force myself to get up and go to school. From the moment I get on the bus I’m already having to fake happiness. I have a couple diagnosis for different anxiety disorders and clinical depression. I want to feel something like happiness or enjoyment but I just don’t. Every day I feel myself get weaker and weaker. I tell my friends I’m ok when they ask. I am failing all my classes and am into all sorta bad habits. I get through every day by drinking, weed, or nic. If I’m not on something then I just don’t feel anything and just sit there in my classes and don’t do or say anything. I have amazing friends and a helpful family but I just don’t know how much longer I can go. My first attempt was to od a few months ago but my dad drove me to the hospital where I got sent to a different place for 2.5 weeks. I miss the feeling of every emotion. Although it feels like that was never me. I’m confused, numb, sad, nervous, and tired every second I’m awake. I think that there’s no reason to keep going because I’m scared of life and it’s not getting better ."
2757,You know what's comforting...I have a belt at least. I could finish up a few of these short stories and then leave.,"There's nothing for me here, anyway. And I'm not living my life a slave to someone else's beck and call like so many wrinkly boomers want you to be.

I can finish these stories and off myself at any time. I wanted to wait until I had a job so I can save up for a gun, but when the hell when that happen? XD

Man, Resident Evil 3 Remake was just revealed and I want to see it for myself...But I don't know how long I can tolerate this mess."
2758,i have been talking 3 of my friends out of suicide for months and it’s starting to drain my mental health,"a couple days ago one of my friends attempted. My other friend said it looks like they tried to hang themself, which really hit me hard. I couldn’t sleep because it was all i could think about. I thought i was going to loose them and they were in such a bad state that i almost started crying, and i barely cry if at all. 

And for the past couple months i’ve been constantly trying to talk one of my best friends out of suicide but literally nothing seems to be helping them. It’s hopeless telling them that this sad feeling isn’t going to last forever and i just want them to get better and start thinking about the effect their suicide will have on others but i can’t see them coming to terms with it any time soon. 

The other friend - i just have no idea what to do. They’re in a very similar situation as the previous friend but they’re a lot less open about it. Literally nothing i can do to help them. 

All of this suicide talk and almost loosing 2 of my close friends is really taking me down recently. I’m not suicidal and will never kill myself, but it makes me very upset for long periods of time when these things happen."
2759,Why should I keep going if there is no path?,I can't fight it anymore everything is impossible no matter how hard I try no matter how much I talk to people no matter how much I try to ignore my past I just can't everything is haunting me literally everything. Even the advices don't help sadly
2760,i can’t feel genuine happiness anymore,"i feel like absolute shit. ever since school started, i’ve been feeling worse and worse. i detach all of my happy memories from my mind, i can’t find the motivation to keep my grades up in school because they just keep going down. i don’t even know if it’s depression but at this point i wouldn’t mind if i died. it’s so sad to say but i don’t think much would change if i wasn’t here. i’m not a perfect student in school and lol i feel like everyone hates me anyway. my friends always talk shit about me and i always passed it as jokes but it crushes me everyday. they make fun of the way i look, the way i dress, shit, even for the stuff i like. anything i talk about is stupid to them. but once i stand up for myself i look like the jerk. 
i feel like i’ve let my family down so much so now it’s up to my younger sister and my cousins to make the family proud. i’m pretty young but i feel like i’ve made so many mistakes in my life and i regret them everyday. it’s pathetic because i lie awake every night wondering what it would be like if i wasn’t here, if i didn’t exist. i wish i didn’t sometimes. i hate myself and i feel so stupid because there are people in worse situations and i’m here basically complaining about stupid shit. everyone saying they’re having a great year makes me jealous. i’m jealous of my friends. they have amazing lives, they have talent, potential, a drive to succeed. i lack any redeeming qualities. we got our SAT scores back and i thought i did good but then saw my friend’s scores and felt so stupid for thinking i did well. i always compare myself to others. i cant find myself feeling happy for my friends, i’m growing more and more distant from everyone, i feel like i’m just existing and passing time. everyday is a cycle, the same shit happens. for the past couple of weeks i’ve been giving people one word answers, i barely show any emotion anymore. im so numb now and i want it to stop. december was always such a happy month for me and everyone else is so happy while i feel like sleeping forever. why would anyone want to live like that? all i even do is sleep because i don’t want to interact with anyone. i stopped doing the things i enjoy, i stopped caring about everything. i promised my family that i’m much better than i used to be and for a while that was true. but it’s all coming to me now, guess it’s karma for holding my emotions back. honestly it hurts even more because i was doing so amazing in the beginning of the year, i had confidence and i was genuinely happy with everything. i didn’t let anything make me cry but now i sit in the dark in my room and cry over being paranoid about what others think of me. i hate the way i look, i hate my body, i hate the way i think. i’m a mess of a person and i wish i wasn’t here 

god, i don’t even know what to do with myself anymore

this is all just a huge rambling, no one even needs to read this."
2761,I’m thinking about suicide,"I hate the feeling of living in pain every single day, hoping it gets better or hoping it gets worse, just so the pain will stop so I can just not have to cry myself to sleep or hide my arms in my sleeves or tell my friends to not worry about he cuts or saying I’m fine when I’m clearly not. It hurts in more ways than emotionally, it hurts physically when I have to cut myself to deal with my emotional pain, when I starve myself for a week and then eat every meal I missed in one go, it hurts more than losing a loved one. It just hurts"
2762,i want to give up,"i’m in 8th grade and we are learning 9th grade algebra. i am diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety &amp; i take 40 milligrams of it a day.  i don’t understand anything in math. my grade is at a 54 and it’s the end of the semester. if i don’t pass this semester i definitely won’t be able to go to high school. what a fucking failure i am. everybody will laugh at me like they always do. and to top it off, my mom told all my teachers that i have depression &amp; anxiety yet my math teacher is still rude to me, embarrasses me in front of the whole class, &amp; gets mad at me all the time. i want to give up. i can’t live like this anymore. i don’t want to live to see me fail. i’ve hated my life since the 4th grade and barely anything has gotten better."
2763,Scared,"Idk how much I trust anymore because I hate the mental health system, but I saw my abuser/ the father of my child today with yet another new girlfriend. He never met his son but likes his other child. He beat me and raped me and left me alone. I feel nothing sometimes I wish he’d kill me ultimately. I only live for my son but sometimes I want to drop all my burdens and let them suffocate me. I was in a mental hospital the past summer for medication adjustment, I can never go back to those hell on earths, so I keep my thoughts a secret, especially from the doctors."
2764,i just want this constant pain to end,"i’m contemplating on if i should just down a bottle of pills right now and end it all. these thoughts are starting to scare me because nothing bad even has to happen to trigger them, even if i have the best day. it doesn’t matter. i get home from school and lay in bed thinking about how fucking worthless i am. it’s like this almost every day, i don’t know what to do. i just feel like trash, i wanna just end it and have all this shit be over tbh. it’s not even worth it barely anyone gives a fuck about me, if i do it i know everyone will get over it soon enough. i cant keep living with this constant self hatred. just had to get this out somewhere"
2765,I can't handle it,"I have been having nightmares very often, many of them about my brothers. Those nightmares tire me and they make me remember episodes I'd rather forget; now I simply try to not sleep. I have muscle pain and I feel suffocated. I want to die. I can't stand my mom and sister anymore. My mom would rather do a tattoo than buy my meds. I'm without meds, of course. Nobody cares and that hurts me. I wish somebody cared. My family doesn't care, my friends don't care. I wish somebody asked me how I am and hugged me, but at least I do have suicide as an option, a very logical one. The whole idea of suicide calms me down. I think about jumping under a train. High school is over and the good of that is no one will be talking about my death anymore. I wanna die."
2766,1/1/2020,I think that is my go date. I cant live without my wife and kids. I cannot continue this life on. I love her. I love my kids. She walked out of me. Everyone thinks she may come back but I dunno. I am lonely. I am depressed. I am sad. I miss them. I didnt make a family for them to leave. I am tired of being alone every day. Despite her leaving I am still nice to her. I still help her. I cant any longer. I want to be out of this life. I want to die. I hope and pray every day I drive to and from work something happens and I die but now I have circled a date. Now to shut that voice off in the back of my head that says this is wrong so i can do it. I am done. I hope one day she finds this post.
2767,i really wanna die,i wanna fucking die
2768,I give up,"I've never felt so awful in my life than I do now. People always say it'll pass but it won't. Every other time I tried to get to sleep, I always felt so shit and I didn't know why. My thoughts were just a complete mess, they were all over the place. Now though, it's different. I know why I feel so shit and it's because I'll never be cis. When I was trying to accept I was trans it was so hard, but the hardest part is just knowing I'll never be a cis boy. If I ever get into a relationship I'm always gonna be 'the trans one'. I'm gonna miss out on all the stupid teenage relationships, and I just want that so much. I just want to fit in for once, but now with this trans shit I'm just always gonna be different. I'm never going to pass as a cis boy, and even if I do I still don't think I'm ever going to fully accept myself. I'm stuck with it my whole life and it's never going away. I just want a normal childhood for fucks sake but I'm never going to get it because I just had to be trans. I just don't see the point in going through with life if it's just gonna be like this. I've made suicide plans before but this time it feels serious. My head feels so much clearer now that I figured out why my life's shit, but it's just made the suicidal thoughts worse. It feels so much more real now, I'm thinking about the best time to do it so I don't ruin Christmas or birthdays or anything, and it seems like February will be the best time. I don't even know if I can stay alive that long. I know where I'll do it, and how. I'll just do it in my bedroom, the only place I've ever felt safe, and I can make a noose from housecoat tier things, or a belt. It seems so easy but I don't know if it will work. I really hope it does, it's my only hope. Don't even know why I made this post, it's not like anybody cares. Bye I guess, I have nothing else to write"
2769,A little venting I'll try to not make it long,"My name is Bryce, I feel like that makes me more comfortable that you all know. I've been struggling with diagnosed depression since 8th grade (I'm a high school junior now). Life has been so great this school year, found a boy I like, averaged a 4.3 GPA last quarter. I love my friends and my band family. Taking 4 AP classes I love. Seeking help for my mental health. About a month ago I started cutting and started burning. In my second period class, someone asked me about how the hand sanitizer+lighter trick worked. I showed them(This was one of the ways I would burn myself) someone was recording me and I got called to the principal's office and now my expulsion is in the process because I committed arson. when my mom dropped me off at home. the first thing I did was grab my Zoloft pills and took about 30 of them.

About five hours later I was throwing them up and was hallucinating. I didn't do my research I guess because overdosing is actually really hard. I spent two days recovering from that. I tied a simple noose to my doorknob and am looking to try again tonight. Made a program to upload a tweet with a google doc that's my suicide note. I tagged one of my friends so it will spread to my other friends. Looking to make a convo before I do it 2nite."
2770,I'm not sure why I keep holding on,"They say that social media and depression are linked.*

I can't help but believe that may be the case for me, but it is rightly so.

As I scroll through my facebook and instagram, I am forced to look at my bullies and acquaintances from high school become normal and happy people with lovers and friends and family.

And here am I, constantly sad and lonely with no prospect of love and happiness seemingly too far to reach. 

I have made academic progress which I am happy about, but it doesnt take away the pain of a loveless life. 

It feels no matter what I do, I can never look myself in the mirror and be content with the young lady that stands in front of me.

Instead, I see a pitiful excuse of a human being that shouldn't be here in the first place. 

I have thought about suicide many, many, many times throughout my 18 years of life and I am ashamed to say that this time is one of those times. 

Noone would miss me.

2771,HELP. NOW. PLEASE,"My friend cut himself. Its BAD. Hes saying hes going to kill himself. Please, someone help. FAST."
2772,Sick and tired (23F),"I’m done with life. I don’t want to get better. There’s so many reasons why. Here’s a comprehensive list. I’m not looking for anyone to talk me out of anything, just want to get some things off my chest. 

	1. Toxic, abusive family. Parents have told me they hate me and that I’m a burden my whole life. Violent and verbally abusive at any chance they get. Wore down my self esteem until I have none left.
	2. Teenage brother is violent and aggressive towards me. He is the same height and almost the same weight, and stronger than me. I’m not allowed to defend myself at all because he’s younger despite the fact that he assaults me almost daily. My parents think he’s inherently worth more than me because he’s a boy. 
	3. Chronic illness. It’s just going to get worse and worse. Eventually I won’t be able to function independently and it’ll be more effort to stay alive and manage day to day than it’s worth. I will have no quality of life.
	4. Single since birth. 23 year old virgin with zero experience. Never been on a date, kissed anyone, etc. It’s making me more miserable every single year that goes by. Kept telling myself it’ll happen soon and it never does. Spare me the stuff about being independent and finding myself. Not having close romantic relationships makes me feel disgusting and unlovable. I’m so ugly and fat and dark. I’m trying to lose weight but I don’t have money for plastic surgery and my skin doesn’t get any lighter no matter what. I can’t help that people from my ethnicity are naturally ugly. Even if I do start dating I’ll have to put up with domestic abuse and painful, violent sex because who doesn’t these days?
	5. Can’t find a job to save my life. Have a few years since my last job so I have no references and a huge gap. No one is willing to take a chance on me and it’s getting harder and harder depending on my parents. It hurts so much because everyone else has no trouble finding a job, some of my friends even get offered jobs to places they visit. What’s so wrong with me that someone can’t just throw me a bone and give me a few hours a week? Already been depriving myself of basic necessities for a long time so I don’t burden my parents, who don’t make all that much. Every rejection feels like a punch in the chest. Kept getting called in for ‘trials’ before being told that someone else got the job. Humiliating and depressing.
	6. Zero social life. Being broke with controlling parents makes it impossible to do anything fun. I’m in college. I should be having fun and meeting people my age but I can’t. I’ve never even been to a real party in my whole life and I feel so left out. The few friends I have don’t care that much and never have time for me. I’m just someone people talk to to pass the time, not an important friend.
	7. Future is gone. Depression/anxiety + trouble at home meant that I’ve gotten bad grades all throughout university and even failed a few courses. No chance of getting a graduate job or applying to a masters or PhD program in future. I’ll be in debt for nothing.

I won’t be humiliated any longer. I want to be the tragic dead girl that everyone feels sorry for instead of the complete joke that no one cares about. I want my parents to care about me for once in my life. Sorry if that makes me a terrible selfish person. I already don’t exist."
2773,so should I do it?,
2774,I'm only 13 and attempted suicide twice.,"When I was nine I fell into a huge depression and tried to end it. Of course, it didn't work, but no one found out. Soon after my parents realised I was depressed and got me meds. 

After two years I got really depressed again. In sixth grade I bought a noose from some kid. One of my friends found out, reported me, and I got sent to a hospital for a week. After that I discovered I was trans, and I was all happy.

It has been another two years, and the feeling is coming back. My grades are shit, I feel so overwhelmed, and I am currently getting a wave of texts from my mom who's still pestering me about my grades. I'm scared to go home."
2775,I have a noose around my neck. Wont die today but it feels good. Is there any hope left for me?,
2776,My end is approaching faster that it seems,"I don't know how much longer I can resist.


My parents borderline hate me, maybe not as a person but just hate the fact that I'm their son.

My irl friends think I'm always joking and that nothing I tell them is serious.

All but one or two of my internet friends find me annoying.

I am unable to help the only person I can relate with, instead I just make things worse.

I'm getting worse ""symptoms"" by the day.

School is stressing me out more than ever and it's bound to get worse as my last finals approach.

I am unable to get help because, as my parents always say, I'm so bad I can't make things fit myself, and all the people who could fisically help me in this process either hate me or don't believe me (or both).

I just want to curl up and disappear, but instead I just stay here, cause I don't want to let the possibility of a better tomorrow go to waste. But instead every day is worse than the one before.


As you might have noticed it's like I'm looking for help but am not willing to actively help myself.
I don't think I deserve help at this point."
2777,I'm lost,"Hello everyone. I'm not using a throwaway because I don't really care anymore. I've been feeling this way since about 2016 when I first tried to take my life. I took a bunch of pills and ended up just being very out of it, and didn't take enough to die apparently. My friend was there and so he made sure I didn't do anything stupid. I haven't felt that bad until recently, where I just don't care about school anymore or being alive. I have had to take 2 semesters off so far because my school won't give me any financial aid and now my campus is essentially getting rid of my major and we have no professors and they won't tell us anything. Each semester I've had to take off I powered through by working over 40 hours and working through the summer and came back the next semester only to do it again the next year and I'll have to do it a third time to pay the semester off. Again. But at this point with the school not caring about my major I have no motivation to go on. It seems like my partner is disinterested in me because I'm only negative anymore and waiting tables does a huge number on your sanity too. I have noticed she is becoming more distant towards me and I feel like I'm just losing my mind anymore and everything is just blending together. I did research on how I've been feeling and it makes it sound like I might have BPD and/or schizophrenia, but the internet tends to make things seem more serious than they are, but I'm not ruling out the possibility of those things as I've just fallen deeper and deeper into this depression. I've stopped caring about school almost entirely and all of the things I'm interested in no longer bring me joy. I plan on working full time all winter and I will certainly continue to fall deeper into this depression. I don't know what to do anymore"
2778,Yeet me off a cliff,"I don't wanna be in this hell hole any longer. I'm curious about death an what happens after. An i'm severely depressed, i lost my job, flunked college, my girlfriend left me 5 days ago. She's already seeing someone else. I can't sleep i have shitty dreams, i have a pounding headache all day. I eat everything or starve myself for days.

The only thing that keeps me here, is knowing my family would be absolutely devastated. But that feeling is starting to fade, though these days.

So who the fuck is talking me down the ledge now? Fuck it Geronimo."
2779,Dec 199999999th,"Let’s go boyssssssss
Poppin the Advil mmmmmmm
I’m expecting this to fail just to get in the hospital and escape but if it doesn’t then we party 🤡🤡"
2780,I think this will probably be my last Christmas. I can’t see myself lasting another year,
2781,17 and a High School Dropout,I just wanted to explain what’s been on my mind I feel as if theses might be my last few weeks on earth I’ve completely given up. The decisions I’ve made with my life I can see will greatly affect my future in a negative way and I don’t want to live a life if it’s going to be filled with pain and hardship as it already has my family doesn’t like me anymore and I can feel it when I’m around them i’m not good at anything and I don’t have any hobbies no friends never attracted the attention of any girls I’m tired of living in a grey sad world there’s no hope for me or my life
2783,"As an incel, I don't see any point living right now","My life ended since I cut my long hair. Pretty dumb idea, but right now I look like an incel, even worse. And incel is someone who is unable to find a woman, not a misogynistic dude.

I hate this life."
2784,If anyone who has thought about suicide or was about to take their life and had another person intervene and help them in some way and you feel comfortable answering....,"If the title pertains to you and you are open to talking about it, I have a few questions. 

1. Was the person who intervened a person who knew you well or was it someone else. 

2. Did the person who intervened realize there was an issue or did you inform them of your intent?

3. If someone who wasn’t close to you asked you if you were thinking of suicide would you tell this person?

4. Would you only tell someone who was close to you that you were thinking about suicide or would you be willing to tell anyone who would listen. 

Thank you to anyone who is willing to share. Please stay strong I care about your life."
2785,I will be okay but not right now,"I need a job. I need a job. I need a job. I need a job. I need a job or I will just be a burden always and will destroy all around me. I need a job. I need a job. I need a job. I need a job. Or I will be useless. I need a job. why is it so hard to get a job? to have motivation? why can´t I get an interview, get rejected and at least learn something. Do people see me being a loser from just seeing my cv? I wanna go and never come back."
2786,It feels really weird,"It feels really weird existing like I feel like I am there but not at the same time, I can sense what's around me but can't process it. Those moments annoy me and slowly burn into my consciousness making wish for the day where I can't experience anything. Sometimes I don't even know what I am thinking about and instead a random series of thoughts are immediately interrupted. (It got a little better but it's coming back"
2787,Living in a foreign country and I just feel so trapped.,"I've been living in the Netherlands (originally from the UK) since September studying a Master's degree. Been living illegally at my Dutch girlfriend's place because housing is difficult to get, dodging the landlord and the handyman and gradually falling behind and hating my course. I am hoping to move into a place with her legally at the end of the week for a lot of money (none of which I can afford to help her with myself), but I lost her passport over the weekend, and now she is scared that someone will try to steal her identity and she's reading all of these horror stories about it and I just feel burnt out and I keep thinking of hanging myself. I hate being a burden - to her, to my parents who are footing the bill on this terrible decision, to do something I don't even want to do anymore. I can't escape anywhere, I feel so trapped."
2788,Fuck Reddit.,"It’s nothing personal, but if you have your settings on this subreddit as “Hot” or “Top” you are not contributing to this subreddit (as much as you could). Obviously everyone on here needs help, but the really sad ones are when you post here, which is some people’s last hope and last try, and nothing comes of it because (no disrespect) but it was sensational enough.The amount of people who have actually done what they come here to get help avoiding is uncountable, but we know that their stories were most likely pretty normal, they were just having a hard time. Please, for the love of this subreddit change your setting to “new”."
2789,My Best Friend Might Kill Himself And I Don't Have His Address! (PLEASE READ)," I've known my best friend online for many many years and he recently moved and I do not know his address but I know the state. Anyway he's been suicidal recently and he's been going through a very rough spot and he's been worse today and I am seriously concerned about his well being and I'm scared he might kill himself soon or maybe even today and I don't know what to do. He used to talk about wanting to kill himself and about how he hated life but in the last week he's been talking about being a burden to his mom and dad and a bunch of other next level stuff. He's my best friend and I can't imagine loosing him. I live in US territory and I'm extremely far away and I don't know his address to call someone and don't have his parents contact info. I'm really scared right now. I know his full name though, is there ANYTHING at all that I could do? Please anyone help"
2790,Waiting,"The worst feeling is when u are laying in bed, crying silently needing someone to talk too. You lay there for hours checking your phone every minute to see if anyone has reached out to you but no one never does..."
2791,I'm all alone and on the brink of suicide,"Hi. My life is lonely and barely worth living. I thought that moving away to university and doing the course of my dreams would fix everything but I was wrong. I'm incapable of making friends and no matter what I do in life I'm always alone and always miserable. I try to make friends and do things that make me happy almost every day but I can't feel real joy and no one ever wants to know me. I'm the butt of everyone's jokes, I'm left out of everything. My house mates are polite but that's as far as it goes. My class mates never invite me to hang outs, I'm always overlooked and they always speak over me on class. It's clear that I don't matter. I don't even think they realise they're doing it, I'm just irrelevant. They forgot to add me to the group chat until I mentioned it. I have autism so socialising is really difficult and I can't fit in ever, plus I don't do well with alcohol (I secretly don't like to drink) but at the same time it's hard when you're always alone. It's gotten to the point where I barely want to get out of bed and I always do but it's effort and exhausting. Every suicide prevention site says to reach out but I have nobody. I've been in care and I've never had real close friends, even in primary school. I can't tell my mum because she's got too much on plus she's made it clear over the years that she thinks suicide is stupid, attention seeking and selfish so she'll just tell me off. She's the only person who I'm actually close to and trust me, from experience I can say that reaching out to her is a bad idea. I do tell her a lot but I can't tell her the full extent of things. As for old friends.... One person I thought was my friend from college scammed me out of money and basically used me. Another raped me. Another drugged me. More just started blanking me. Others spoke about me behind my back. Its like all people do is use me for sex, cigarettes, something to laugh AT, money and a way of filling the time. I thought that things would be different here at university but they're not. Of course my complete lack of human connection isn't the only reason that I'm depressed. I have bipolar and my medication only stops the mania leaving me to tackle the depression alone every fucking day. Plus I'm nonbinary and I hate that everyone thinks I'm a girl but Im afraid to come out so it's painful to hear the gendered terms all day. Plus I hate my body and although I no longer behave like a person with an eating disorder I certainly think like one (I used to starve myself and binge a lot) which makes things really hard in day to day life. Also I have crippling anxiety and spend pretty much every day feeling like I'm having a heart attack. Also I'm unwelcome in my family home because my sister hates me and Christmas is coming up which I'm dreading because I'll be staying with them. Its that or spend the day alone crying. Also I live in a city which is littered with crime. And I've just realised that I'm terrible at the things that I love (my only source of happiness) and am studying as a degree: writing. Shit this is really long, I should probably wrap up here. I don't know what to expect from posting this on reddit but it's got to be better than suffering in silence. I've not told anyone all of this."
2792,Wife laid our suicide plan,"During a “discussion” my wife pretty much laid out a plan to end her life. She said it would be done in such a way that we would not have to worry about her. 

We were not having a fun conversation, but I could not help but wonder if she was serious. Or was she doing this to get at me for some reason. Needless to day it left me off balance and a little scared. 

Anyone have thoughts on this?"
2793,Only aim of my life is not committing suicide,
2794,What to do in the last 24 hours?,"Hi, after some time I made up my mind. Too many things happened in my life and I don't want to change my decision. I went to psychiatrist, psychologist, etc. And I tried. And I was high-functioning. This is not my first post here. But emough is enough and all I want to do is die peacefully. 
Do you recommend anything? An interesing movie? Something to eat? 
You alle are amazing and I really appreciate what you are doing."
2796,It's getting to the point where I don't want any extra help. Only way people can help me now is to comfort me until I do kill myself.,"Sad part is that my life isn't entirely that bad. Just burning out with work and sick and tired of the pain of losing someone I love. I do go to therapy but it only helps so much though. Plus it won't fix my problems, which is what I need, and nobody can help me with that. 

Please don't tell me that things will get better or that time will help things. 1) You don't know that I will get better. Yes things can get better but things can also get worse. 2) Time isn't helping. It is only making things more real and I am only getting worse with each day. I slowly lose interest in things I enjoy.

No one can help me at this point. If you want to help me, you can comfort me until I kill myself. I probably won't do it yet because I would like to do/try some things before I go. Unless my life does a 180 within the next few months then I'll probably be dead coming spring or summer. I'm not holding my breath. I'm slowly working on my plan to die"
2797,When was the last time you hugged someone (not to be polite),The other day I noticed that I haven't had a hug for 5/6 years.
2798,I’m 20 years old and really excited for my suicide,"I’m getting my car insured soon, and I’ll be able to drive into the woods where I hid my gun last year. I’m gonna be able to end my life! I can finally terminate probation early, erase my felonies through suicide (it’s the only way, you can’t expunge convictions,) and rewind into the next life!

I’m planning on listening to some Juice Wrld (rip man you helped me through so much but now you’re gone) and probably some Lil Peep before I blast my chest. I wanna feel the pain and unfixable damage a bullet does to your organs cause I deserve all the pain. It’s just a few more weeks and imma clock out forever. Fuck the world and an unforgiving society. I’m not gonna do the felony life just cause I stole some shit at 19 and hurt NOBODY. I’m holding my OWN fuckin trial and my sentence is death since the judge wants me to be some disenfranchised felon.

This shits a racket bro I’m not playing this life shit, it’s a bullshit game and I ain’t doing slavery cause the regime we call gov won’t forgive me"
2801,Giving Up,"I’ll never be in a relationship or have really good friends. I’m too quiet. I’m too boring. I’ve done everything I can do, but I can’t change genetics. No point in being alive if I’m going to live my life completely alone."
2802,This site is cancer but I don’t know where else to rant.,"I stopped taking my meds a while ago, I stopped by accident but then I noticed and just never started taking them again. Getting better means dealing with my shit and you know what? It’s easier to just be a bad person and justify it with my mental health. There’s also the fact that every time I start getting better my brain thinks it’s a TOTALLY OKAY topic to talk about with people. It’s not. You can’t tell people you hardly know you want to kill yourself just because you’re drunk and meds give you weirdly forward confidence. 

One part of me KNOWS I need to take them and get better but the other half of me knows it’s so much easier to just fucking die. 

Oh and while I’m ranting let’s just vent this off, every fucking time my mums friend come around she sees my pill boxes on the side and goes oh! Only x mg, that’s pretty low, I’m on x mg, it’s one of the strongest ones. Like thanks Carolyn?? I didn’t realise it was a competition mate but I’ll keep it in mind next time I’m thinking about jumping in front of a train x"
2803,Friend beat me to it - not sure whether I am more sad or more jealous,"Just got a phone call from his sister to let me know.  K was a paramedic, no, not just a paramedic, a bloody good paramedic.  He was funny and kind and would help anyone.  

Apparently there had been some problems at work (his sister did tell me about it but she was kind of muddled which is understandable).  

K retained left over opiates from patients who didn't need the full dose and injected himself.  He was only found because he didn't turn up for shift yesterday.

I don't have that many friends that I can afford to lose one.  

On the other hand, I guess it's one less person that I will disappoint when I die.

Godspeed K.  I love you."
2804,whats the point in living anymore,"For years I've been dealing with depression and i can't get over it. Every time something good happens to me its ripped away. My parents are the greatest thing to happen to me even though we argue all the time and im always a complete fuck up, they still love me. I don't have many friends at all i never did. Relationships are always terrible. Like the one im in now. i love this girl so much but not even 30 mins ago she texted that she doesn't know if shes ready for a relationship and said she would call me once she thought it through. Usually smart people would just walk away but not me.I crave attention and a relationship and im to scared to walk out of a toxic one because i fear i will never find someone again. It took me three years to finally trust people again and start looking for a new relationship. My last one ended in her fucking some of my friends. I failed out of boot camp because im a pussy. i failed out of college because of my cheating ex. I just started college again and i dont know if im still cut out for it. I failed my EMT test twice and when ever someone ask how it went i tell them im passed because im to scared to face the reality that im a total fuck up. I dont know what to do anymore. I might kill myself tonight who knows. If this is my last night and if my family some how finds this i want to say sorry its not your fault it never was. I love you and take care of yourselves."
2805,I Just Bombed Another Interview,"I can’t even stand up. I don’t know why I’m not good enough for anyone. I wish I had a family so badly. I’m going to be homeless, and once that happens, I’m going to find some fentanyl and kill myself with it. I hate you Dad, for leaving me behind to be abused. I hate you Mom, for abusing me. I hate you society, for discarding me. I’m not worthless, all of you are."
2806,When you look like you're on top,"I'm numb. I'm mad I couldn't win. I'm sick. I'm sick of being sick. I'm tired, but I'm too scared to sleep. I've held a knife to my forearms, and thought it'd only hurt for a second, then it'd feel relaxing. I've held a gun to my head, only to set it down and cry. Cry because I'm weak. Or strong. Something, it's all the same to me now. 

I think everyone is stupid for settling, but i wish I had their brains to settle. I wish good enough was good enough. I wish my tribe cared about me. I wish I didn't look so strong, and I wish everyone knew I stood up to their bullies because I can't stand up to my own. All I want to do is fish, and love, and hunt, and fight, and tell stories. But I'm stuck in a world where I don't feel good enough. I wish everyone would just give up on me. I don't belong, and I'm afraid I never will."
2807,"The question isn’t if I’m going to to it anymore, it’s where.",I don’t want to do it where my family will find my body because my mom would be devastated. The only place I can think of is to do it in a large forest no one lives near
2808,Feel utterly useless and trapped at rock bottom.. about to drown myself in alcohol and I'm scared of what will happen,"My awful job has left me isolated and feeling useless. I'm essentially forgotten. I sit at my desk 8 hours a day and do nothing. It's been like this for MONTHS I have no direction, no goals, no support. I broke down and cried at work. I've been self medicating with pills and alcohol almost every night. I have awful thoughts of hurting myself. I've never cut myself. But I am really afraid I'm going to burst. I dont think I can quit my job and I feel stupid like I can't do anything right. And even if I got a new job, the people would abandon and ostracize me just like I have been my whole life. I am going to go to a bar and drink until I cant feel myself anymore and prolong the fact that I have to go back to work and pretend everything is fine. My boss tells me to be patient and gives no other help. I only have one friend and my parents. I am scared to tell them I am suicidal. I dont want them to be scared or sad with me. I need an out from this endless cycle of drinking and mania and pill induced calm when really I want to fucking scream and throw myself off a bridge. I think id be doing everyone a favor. No one cares about me and I cant fit in. My fucking therapist tells me I need to be confident. I AM A GOOD PERSON. BUT I HAVE BEEN HURT AND TRAUMATIZED I cant go into all the details of how because no one fucking cares. And people tell me not to victimize myself, but HOW? I WAS A VICTIM. SO MANY BAD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO ME IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS. I CANT FUCKING LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE. IM NOT GOING TO BE FUCKING PATIENT"
2809,I'm feeling suicidal but don't know if it's real or not.,"I've been feeling really low for the past few days but I'm in a weird state of feeling okayish and now I'm doubting whether I was suicidal in the first place or whether it was just for attention.

I got no attention from it and I hate having attention on me but I have no idea

Does anyone else ever feel like this? Or this confused.

I need to tell my parents. I'm going to the doctors on Monday hopefully they can help me

I don't know anymore."
2810,Took 7 pills. Gonna take more round 4,Fuck why can't I die
2811,Struggling with unemployment,"So my gf is a HS science teacher, and she loves/hates her job. I was working as a rec specialist last week for my tribe, who is a martyr (working 3am-9pm on a Saturday, on top of the usual work week, was pretty much a monthly occurence. Normal practices dont apply because theyre a sovereign nation). With her insistence, I left the job because I was truly starting to consider suicide. I only started the job to get insurance to see a health professional, but the Navajo Nation tribe likes to make you ""earn"" your benefits. Before investing in me, they had me hired as a full-time temporary employee from May-December. I still dont have medical coverage, and yes I am Navajo.

My gf often gets very stressed out by her job, and I constantly do my best to help by starting her car/making her coffee/wiping her frosted windshield in the mornings, and handling most household chores i.e. laundry and dishes and vacuuming. I also take care of myself (cooking/cleaning) and always have my own money. 


Today, she came home during her prep hour and I had been working on my resume and looking for alternative means to make an income. My gf insisted I quit my job a long time ago, so I can focus solely on becoming a professional fighter, and constantly says she fully supports my dream. She is not Navajo, and is appalled by how the tribe treats its people.


I shared a few business ideas with her, and then listened to how her morning was going. She then asked, ""So what have you been doing all day, just hanging out?"" I instantly thought of the fact I had sparring yesterday, went on a 4 mile run today, and am taking the time to explore/develop means to make an income without giving my life away by the hour. Though she says she fully supports my dreams, I cant help but feel she is judging me because she has somewhere to report to from 7:30-3:30. I still pay half of rent and electricity, and I cant help but think I'm better off ending my life and not even dealing with all these emotions and/or failures"
2812,I feel like I’m in the middle of a forest screaming for help but no one can hear me. There’s only one way out of this nightmare.,
2813,I need help,I really want to die but I don’t actually want to actively kill myself.
2815,Im a failure,"I cant keep going on living like this. I have no drive, passion, or enjoyment in life. I just want to be better but i dont deserve it. This would be better than living another 60 years in misery."
2816,How many people on here are dealing with anxiety and depression and desperately need help right away but don’t want to go to the hospital for fear of being commited? It’s torture waiting for insurance to make a decision...,
2817,Why do people insist on telling me to go to therapy?,"Been there, done that, got worse. 


When I tell someone why I’m having panic attacks, I don’t care that therapy worked for them. That’s not helpful. 


And even if I did respond well to therapy, pretty sure I could have come up with that idea on my own."
2818,I am a recovering drug addict,Hey i just made a post im ju wondering to every drug addict or recovering drugaddict or just drug user how has drugs changed you and your life it has changed my for The worse in every way i just want to see IF im alone with this i am suicidal personally...
2819,Uhhhh I've had enough.,"I'm so done. I just live to work. I'm unhealthy. I'm boring. I'm never happy. I wish I had the courage to end it all. If it wasn't for those around me I might. 

Fuck this. It wasn't supposed to be like this."
2820,Im sick and tired of life,"Im tired of taking vare of my mom and wiping The tears of her face
Im tired of trying to explain to my yunger brother why i dont live with them and my dad
Im tired of being scared every Day and being treated like im a dumbass
Everyone has an image of me as this tweaker and my brain is fucked up, The only thing preventing me from commiting suicide is my mom would probaly commit suicide asweel as she is deppresed and talked about taking her life and im also scared of god, im tired of not being trusted because i was a drug addict and im so fucking sad because i dragged my best friend into drugs and now im crying cause i have to help him when he is high, probaly commiting suicide tonight atleast i hope so"
2821,Harrassed online and I just want to die.,"I posted here yesterday but no one responded, so I figured I would give an update.

In my last post, I mentioned how this girl had been harrassing me on this site I go on. A lot of context is on that post. I stopped talking to her yesterday, I've been ignoring her, ""reading"" her messages in a way she can't know I'm seeing them. She sent me this longwinded message about how horrible a person I am and she called me a bunch of names and to 'stay away from her and her friends.' Apparently, she found out when I had confided to another ""friend"" about what was going on.. so much for confidentiality. And I have had issues with this other ""friend"" so I know they are having a great time talking shit about me lol.

It's funny because the ""friend"" I confided to, she didn't even know this person. But somewhere in the last two days, they started talking to each other and now on the website, she's like ""I LOST A ""FRIEND"" TODAY BUT NOW I HAVE (INSERT OTHER PERSON'S NAME HERE) AND I LOVE YOU AND ADORE YOU SO MUCH""

I'm just dumbfounded really. This girl is 17 years old and she has a witch hunt out for me. Why does she keep attaching herself to different people? Is it because they keep telling her how amazing she is and (obviously) how horrible I am (or whatever person she's pissed at)?

It just hurts because of the names she called me. And she told me 'karma is a bitch' even though I didn't do anything malicious to her (besides block her briefly, which was deserved because she kept verbally attacking me) and she also told me I deserved what happened to me before I met her (something traumatic and hurtful happened due to someone else)

I don't know what to do. I just feel like such an awful person and I am tired of being harrassed. I want someone to tell me she will get what she deserves, she can't keep manipulating people, but I know that nothing will happen to her and she will just continue on her merry way doing whatever she wants.

If I am this awful of a person (while being nothing but nice to others yet not afraid to stand up for myself) then what's the point of being alive? I get it's just stupid people online but if people online hate me for no reason, people IRL who actually KNOW ME must feel the same way too..."
2822,I finally realized how unstable I am and it kinda scares me,"Two days ago I was laying here researching suicide methods. Now I'm laying here after a good productive day looking forward to tomorrow.

Sometimes the low points last a few days, sometimes they're better or worse. Same with the highs. But for some reason this time having two such contrasting mindsets so close together.. it all just kinda hit me at once how fucking unstable I am. 

Right now I have dreams, plans, wants in life. When my mood takes a turn I believe that I have to die. And there's nothing I can do to change my mind, to pull myself out of it. When will it happen again? Next week? Tomorrow? I could wake up suicidal again for all I know. I can't trust myself. I spend so much time in my own head, escaping reality, that I never noticed how bad I've become.

I've had a reoccuring thought lately, ""I wish I could feel the same way two hours in a row"". It resonated with me. Fuck I don't know what's wrong with me"
2823,I don't want to hurt anymore,"I've pushed everyone away. I live on a couch that's not my own. I'm 34 and I have no direction in life nor any desire for it. I feel like I'm screaming and no one hears me. 

I finally told the person who says they love me. They want nothing to do with that part of me. He's been nothing but cold and mean ever since.

I know how I'm going to do it and the best time to do it, I just have to choose who finds me. I definitely won't put that on my daughter, I'll make sure she's not here.

This is the farthest I've gotten into planning.

Every moment is pain. I'm all alone in it.

And it's all my fault."
2824,everything hurts,"at one point in my life i think i realized i can't go on like this. my whole body is numb. i feel like my existence doesn't matter. everything i do is horrible and my throat hurts  


i can't i can't i can't fuck ican't"
2825,I’m so tired but I don’t have any reason to be tired (heads up this is a very long messy rant),"Sometimes I feel like I’m faking everything even though it’s not really true, but there’s not explanation for me to feel so bad. I just. Feel bad. Like maybe something not really good happened in the day (or overall life ngl) and I just keep thinking about it and that things make me feel so bad and sad and powerless and just. Tired. I’ve gone to therapist and she didn’t tell me I had any mental illness so sometimes I think im faking it or not valid but. idk man I’m just confused. And I want to do stuff but even tho I want to when I have the time to do it I just don’t and stay laying on my bad browsing random social media without doing anything productive

I don’t know what any of all of this means and I’m feeling so confused but I guess that I faked everything that’s Also a reason I want to die and back to step one ho boi"
2826,Hey Guys 🖤,"I never usually post to this sub [*insert explanation of how I have noone else to talk to and need help*]

What are some things that you do when you feel completely out of control emotionally? What's something you do to take your mind off of the suicidal urges and thoughts of self harm?"
2827,How can I do it right this time,I need to do it right this time. I need to get away forever and I don't care how.
2828,Is there really a point to life?,Seriously? What is the point?
2829,Fantasizing about Suicide because it helps me cope.,"I fantasize about suicide often. I do it because when I'm fantasizing about how I'm going to take my own life, I dont think about all the other negatives in my life. It's become like a form of meditation for me. It makes me feel calm. Like I finally have control over something.
I've come very close to doing it befor, but held back because I still have some people that love me and responsibilities to those people. But it has gotten more and more tempting as time goes by. The fantasy becomes a plan. And eventually, plans become reality."
2830,If they turn my lights out for non-payment I think I'll just give up,"I'm 2 months behind. And it's not even a hefty bill, average 40-50$ a month. But I just don't have the money. If I get shut off I think I'll just kill myself for letting myself get so far behind. My credit is already destroyed from not being able to pay student loans and needing to go on repayment assistance for the last 5 years. I'll never be able to pay all my bills every month and not be in the negatives. Life is too expensive. I can't afford it.

I don't want anyone to have to spend more money to make sure my body gets a casket and funeral though... The death industry is a rip off. Maybe I'll just bury myself and lay in the hole and die. Freeze to death."
2831,I can't see it getting any better,For a while now everything's just been getting worse. even when i thought i was at my lowest somethjng new came up. yesterday a close family friend committed suicide and i don't want to see anyone suffering anymore. i want to stop going to school bevause i don't see why i should if it's not going to get any better
2832,might not have a choice,"I’m a disabled schizophrenic who is technically homeless but has been staying with my mom to avoid sleeping on the streets while I try desperately to apply and receive disability to survive. 

Disability called my mom because she was listed as one of my contacts, and in her usual manner she called me and started screaming at me to “just fucking call them back” bc she thinks that me and my therapist are working too slow on it and she wants me out of her house faster. 

I had a long sleepless night, started to fall asleep, and was awoken by one of her tantrums this morning during which she broke the coffee machine for (??) some reason ig. 

I was sick of my life and sick of her and I exploded over text and said 

“mom I am doing EVERYTHING through my therapist. I called her back and she immediately started asking questions I don’t have the answers, paperwork, or ANYTHING on ok?! I DO NOT call her on my own because my replies literally decide whether I’m going to have a future or die in a gutter on the side of the road. This is important and dangerous for me and I don’t have the needed information to make anything work and thats WHY I wait to call with my therapist. Please stop!!!!”

she replied:

“We are going to talk about you living somewhere else so other people can handle your life for you. Clearly I can’t and I’m done with it.”

There is no where else to live. Her saying this equals to me sleeping on the streets. In December. As a 19 year old girl. In the city. In the middle of America’s center for sexual trafficking and opioids and serial killers. 
Aka- a death sentence for me. 

I said:

“sweet!!! Fine by me!!! Im tired of living every second of my life in fear of your anger and I’m tired of feeling my heart sink in my chest when I hear your truck come home bc I know that things as simple as “moved the ottoman less than a foot” and “didn’t do the dishes until I got back home” are all it takes to make you EXPLODE AT ME and threaten me and I’m tired of you using me as the constant punching bag for your stress!!!!! you cant live like this??? neither can I. I’m sorry me being disabled is such a letdown for you. im sorry that my existence is shameful for you. im sorry I’m not the child you always hoped for, and that you’re disappointed every time you look at me.

you think you’re the only one with a hard life, but I’m dealing with my own shit too. I’m dealing with being raped by my ex, I’m dealing with my best friend fucking DYING bc of me, I’m dealing with the guilt eating me up inside every single day bc I couldn’t even be there for him at his FUNERAL because my ex was there, I’m dealing with the financial issues just like you are, I’m dealing with ALL of it while being disabled and homeless and dealing it while you CONSTANTLY tell me my life is easy and look at me like I’m garbage to you and scream at me so you can take out everything that’s wrong with your own life!!!!!”

She didn’t reply. She gets home in an hour. In an hour, my life is over. 

My options are: sleep on the city streets and either freeze to death, get kidnapped, sex trafficked, serial killer’d, beaten who KNOWS what- or kill myself first and avoid a worse fate. 

I have one hour. I think my choice here is clear. 

gg, everyone. :(("
2833,I want to be loved,I want to be good enough
2834,"Got scammed, might have committed a crime. If I get convicted, I'm going to kill myself, because I would lose everything.","I'm 18 years old and a college freshman, and I fucked up bad.

My parents worked hard to try to send me to college, and I ended up with a full-ride merit scholarship to a T15 school in the US. However, about a month and a half after turning 18, I met this girl online. She said she was 16 and kept sending me nudes, and then asked to see my nudes. I never solicited her for nudes or sex or anything; I simply sent her a single dick pic. I thought it was okay because she was above the age of consent in my state, but then she hit me with the ""I have your name and FB info, I'll report you to the police and to your university unless you pay me 250 dollars"". I started to panic and told her I was poor, and I ended up paying her 100 dollars on CashApp (which requires a debit card/SSN, so her parents would have to know about the transactions she made if she was 16). She then instructed me to delete the conversation off of my phone and said she wouldn't contact me again.

It's been 6 weeks since then. She hasn't contacted me, and I've been reading up on scams like this. They said that most of the perpetrators are actually older than 18, so I never actually committed a crime, but I still can't shake the feeling that she might actually have been 16 and I fucked up badly. I have so much to lose (job prospects, housing, my scholarship, my admission to my university), and I was being so fucking dumb that night. I've resolved that if, in the future, the police does end up knocking on my door and I end up getting charged with even a misdemeanor, I'm going to kill myself no matter what, because I'm a stupid coward who wants to escape the consequences of anything happening.

I really don't know what I should do at this point. I know if I told my parents it would destroy them, and I'm really scared of the off chance that this person was actually a minor and not a stupid scammer and that I end up going to jail. What should I do? I can't afford a lawyer or a therapist as a student, so the only way for me to deal with this is to kill myself, I guess."
2835,I fucked everything up,"I just want to die. I’m so tired of failing and failing

I’m barely human"
2836,Someone give me a real reason,"Someone give me an actual good, and not some bullshit reason not to end my life. I’m sick of living the same day over and over again. No way of bettering my life, it can only go down from here. Also, why do I have to put other’s happiness before mine; “people will be sad and miss you” blah blah, so does that mean my sadness and pain means nothing? Like it’s my life and why can’t I decide when it’s time to go? For anyone reading this, thanks."
2837,I don’t care anymore. I give up.,"This is a long one.
In sixth grade I was a straight A+ student. I used been for a couple of years. Obviously it’s not that hard to do that, but my parents were fresh out of divorce so my dad always hyped up my grades. 
Within about the first six weeks of seventh grade, I understood that I was no longer going to be a straight A student. A couple of years before then, I had broken my leg, we were pretty sure that I healed fine. Until it was my last appointment with my ortho doctor, when he said that I required another set of surgeries to fix my leg. I won’t get into details, but it was related to my growth plates.
That surgery really wasn’t that bad, but I could not do swim that year, due to the surgery. That was basically my entire summer. We were done with surgeries.

Just kidding, no we weren’t. I ended up having a major reconstructive surgery on my leg. I couldn’t walk for eight weeks, and I ended up in a pretty deep depression.

Luckily, I’m all but healed of the surgery. But my grades are not even near what they used to be, and I abuse diphenhydramine. I’m not addicted, but I use it every so often just so I feel something different. It’s not even pleasurable. I just hate the norm. I’m recovering from this depression, but I just can’t get out. I keep failing quizzes and tests. I failed another test today. I can’t keep going. It fucking sucks. I have another major operation in 16 days. I hope my dad keeps the Hydrocodone away from me."
2838,losing everything,"Hi everyone... first post on Reddit. Been a lurker for over a year now but just got the courage to speak my mind instead of hiding behind everyone else's comments with upvotes.

 Today hasn't been a good day for me. Life seems pointless. I cut ties with a friend who chose her boyfriend over me two times in a row after forgiving her last year. I lost my other best friend because I took this friend back. Now both friends want nothing to do with me and I'm alone.

&amp;#x200B;

 I also failed a class in community college, dropping me to only 9 credit hours passed, which means that my Pell Grant (the only way I'll be able to afford college) was suspended and there's no ""viable"" reason as to why I failed. I didn't go to class because I didn't want to face my teacher who would ask me why I wasn't coming to class so I just.. didn't go. My mother is extremely disappointed in me and I can't face her anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't want to eat. I don't want to move. I want to waste away outside so I can feed the soil and be of at least some use to something on Earth. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm 18 and I've known that life hasn't had a purpose since I was 7. We all end up 6 feet under the ground or in a box on someone's mantle. Doesn't matter who you are, what you are, how you are, anything. We all die. I've thought of suicide since I first figured out the word's meaning and the only thing keeping me from doing it is the pain. I wish there was an easy way out. Some of us weren't meant to be born. I never asked to be given life. I hate it.

Sorry for dumping my problems on this subreddit but I don't have anyone else to go to. I'm sorry."
2839,I want to die.,"Refused to take antidepressants, my life is currently extremely precarious. I’m in tremendous pain and I just don’t want to feel this way anymore."
2840,need a reason to stay,"I'm so lonely. I have no friends. I haven't for years. I've never been in a relationship. Everyone tells me that it'll happen eventually but it doesn't feel like it.

I'm in college which demands much more effort than I want to give right now. I just want to sleep.

Also I got rejected by my crush recently so that blows.

I need a purpose. I'm so tired. I just want to sleep forever"
2841,I don't want to die,"I don't want to die, but I just don't know how to fucking live. I can't do shit. I want sleep all day. I'm too cowardly to commit suicide. Honestly, fuck me."
2842,Tried to off myself this morning,I thought hanging would be quick and relatively painless. I was wrong. Instead of enjoying the extra time I have on this planet I'm out here thinking of new ways to do it.
2843,I'm Living in a Nightmare and I want it to End,"I feel like I am living in a nightmare and I just don't wanna experience it anymore. I know people have had it way worse than me, but I realistically do not think I can keep going on.

A couple of months ago I was raped and I was threatened to keep it secret; I made the mistake of waiting too long before having it reported. I go to a University, so the University decided to help ""keep me safe"" alongside the Police, as it was their idea to investigate after hearing what had happened. However the University began investigating, but because it created a lot of controversy, the case was closed twice (I repealed it but it just recently again closed) without any charges, and the police would not take me serious. What's worse is the fact that the roommate of the rapist and the rapist himself have been harassing and spitting at me ever since the case was filed, and the roommate is very close with most of the Residential Assistants and their boss, explaining why they won't even acknowledge my existence. 

Rumors spread saying I faked it all for attention, despite witness accounts and after backing from mental-professionals I had to seek because of the trauma (of which they gave coping mechanisms but said I was beyond their care and I would need to seek outside the University help); people constantly give me dirty looks, spit at me, getup and move away from me if I sit near them, and any romantic connections I had/relationships have resulted in me getting dumped because no one wants me based on the rumors + the baggage.

I don't have family support either, as I don't really have much blood family, and the family I do have I am dead to them. Lot's of my friends have stayed out of the situation to avoid getting harassed as well; I feel so alone and like I don't belong here anymore. Before all of this, I thought the childhood trauma and everything that happened from growing up would stay in the past, even after affecting me, but this is the nail in the coffin.

I really feel like I can't do this anymore, but thank you if you actually read it. I just wanted someone in the world to know what I am going through; at least someone might understand.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - I was raped, University buried my case, most people are on the side of rapist's best friend, I am regarded as sub-human by 95% of people I know."

2845,Fastest method to kill yourself without pain?,title
2846,Just tried of even trying any more,"10 years pretty much down the drain.  Got re-married after my first divorce to someone that I thought would be able to handle things. I have severe PTSD and some anxiety and some eating disorders out there. I am prone to outbursts, but I am not violent, I just yell a lot. Depression is always there, and some days are better than others.  Struggled for years, tried doing therapy and even medications, but because of my weight (I am pretty underweight), a lot of the medications don't work the way that they are supposed to, and some I can't even take at all.  My soon to be ex-wife was there in the beginning, but could give a fuck less now that's for sure.  Everything was going fine this morning til she starts to yell at the kids about some bullshit, which sparks off other shit and turns into a fight.  Instead of trying to do anything to make it better, she just digs in further and makes it much worse.  I end up leaving to take the kids while she finishes getting ready, but she takes it another way and insists on a divorce (her standard tactic when the argument doesn't go her way, or I start to point out her behavior in things), and tells me that I should just go kill myself because her and all my friends know that I will do it eventually any ways.  And she's pretty right.  I have been planning it out for a few years now, trying to get some things in order, but fuck it.  Why even wait? Why bother to even deal with this shit.  I so much don't give a fuck I am not even using any of my throwaways.  I fucking don't care any more, and I don't really even want to deal with this shit.  yeah, I still have some kids at home, and I am sure that when I do kill myself it will affect them, but they will get over it one day I am sure.  I don't know that I can stand to keep with this person, but I certainly can't go anywhere either.  completely stuck with only one way out.  Why do I even fucking bother."
2847,"""Cloud state""?","Is it just me or have other people experienced this kind of ""cloud state"". It's this thing where i can't feel anything...like nothing. No pain, no sadness, no happiness, nothing. I call it the ""cloud state"" because it fells like i'm in this cloud that just filters out all emotions. I'm tired of it, it's worse than feeling sad or pain. I just want to feel ANYTHING, ANYTHING AT ALL!

 Anyway, I just want to know if i'm the only one, or if anyone else is experiencing this as well. 
Who am i kidding, it's probably a common thing and i'm just a dumbass..."
2848,My fiancee cheated on me,"I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for 14 years now. About a year ago I finally got some mental help and put on an antidepressant and an antipsychotic to stop my compulsive suicidal ideation. Most days are pretty good now. But last night I found out my fiancee cheated. Idk what to do. I'm laying in bed with a closet full of guns next to me. I've always envisioned hanging myself, but a gun would do. The only thing stopping me is my new baby nephew. I really wanna watch him grow up. But idk. I'm tired of hurting. I thought I finally found someone that wouldn't hurt me. Now I can't trust anyone. I just feel really broken and I want to take the easy way out."
2849,This is the end,Im fucking tired of being everyones problem and im too much of a d to kms so ive decided tomorrow i will just ignore my feelings and be happy around everyone again. If im sad then that will be my problem when im alone and then i can hurt myself as much as i want to. At least people will hopefully start to like me :) ♡
2850,I have a 94% overall average in school but I’ll probably kill myself once I’m done school tho,"Idek why I’m choosing to do my work in school, I guess just to graduate from high school finally. But I don’t have any plans for the future, nothing interests me and it has been like that for 2.5 years since my diagnoses of clinical depression. I should be enjoying my life at 18, almost 19, but rather I focus on wanting to die almost everyday. I literally have the highest mark in one of my classes and I’m above average in marks in my other classes but little do the teachers and students know that I’m wanting to die every moment, and being numb to life."
2851,Stay At Home Mom,"I've always had depression, from the times when I was little living in poverty with my single father who was a raging alcoholic, to my freshman year of college. Always. I had my daughter in hope that it would give me meaning, purpose to force me to continue living (I know extremely selfish). Today, I find myself writing goodbye letters, to my daughter and fiance. She is two, so I take comfort in her not remembering me (I know, fucked up). I'm to the point in this world where I cant take care of myself anymore and signing up for disability. No friends. No family. No job. No desire to go on, we all die, why not embrace it early? I used to cling to the idea that things would get better. They dont, life is just one painful thing after another. Theres no point in trying to succeed we all just die on the wheel of life. I'm out guys."
2852,Any attempt survivors?,"I'm almost at my one year anniversary of my attempt. I am in a better place now but I'm finding that a lot of the old feelings are coming back and starting to feel overwhelming. Are there any other attempt survivors here? I just want someone I can relate to, to talk to about this. What did you do on your anniversary?"
2853,"I am so, so, so tired.","I’m tired, I’m giving up. On everything and everyone. I am so lonely even when there’s people around. I’m so tired of myself. I think this might just be it."
2854,I want to kill myself.,Everyone takes me as a joke no one wants to talk to me and I feel lonely and I want to kill myself to get rid of this never ending nightmare.
2855,I have everything. I’ve made it and I still want to die,"I have everything. I am 23 and own my dream condo, have amazing friends and family. I have travelled all over. I have people who love me. Yet my mind never shuts up and the anxiety never stops. And if it goes away then it comes back again and it’s always worse. I obsess over the most mundane of things like a chip in the floor and it makes me go crazy and I think / worry about it all day. I am at the point right now where I cannot do anything. Just lay in bed all day and avoid phone calls and friends. The only thing I can do is take care of my dog and I even feel like I suck at that and she is sick. It feels like there is no point. I have everything and l always said when I made it here I would be okay but it isn’t true and it makes me even more pathetic. I don’t want to be here anymore. I keep thinking what the most peaceful way to go is. Also sick of being heart broken and being hurt by people. I am fragile and feel I can’t handle what normal people can"
2856,"pills, so many pills","there are pills everywhere. i close my eyes and i see pills. i want to take every pill i have close to me, but nobody cares enough to stop me. i don’t want to ask for help because i’ll pussy out from doing it and it’ll be a waste of time. i really want to, i don’t know why but i have such a strong urge right now"
2857,I am pretty sure I have BPD,"After my latest panic at my wife getting mildly upset, I decided to look more into it and I am pretty sure I have borderline personality disorder. As I am in the national guard I can’t seek treatment for this, and even if I did there is apparently no cure. I also am about to start a new job which I am afraid I will screw up because of this issue.

I think it is best that I immediately remove my broken, unfixable ass before I further fuck up my wife, son, the military and my employer."
2858,I guess I now know the day I'll die,"I (m 18) once posted my story on the subreddit depression and everything but I never have really thought I'll come here one day.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I lost my last hope, a good friend of mine I am in love with today told me that we wont getting together and I now that is a weak reason to end his live but that hope was the only thing that prevented me from killing myself. I was sexually abbused when I was 5 by my cousin, I was bullied till I was 15, nobody ever loved me and I was rejected and hurted so many times, my mother hates me since the day she got pregnant with me, my dad only loves me when my sister does something bad or rejects him, I'm in therapy but this is not enough because everythig brakes apart. I already survived a long and hard depression that nearly killed me back then I didnt cut myself or something like that. Today I injured myself for the 7th time with an cigarette. Three over the last month three today and once in august.

I ordered razor blades to slit my wrists and I am planning to do it on the first of january. I'll do it that way so I can suffer in death. It feels like i deserve it that way.

My best friend is the reason I am alive now 'cuz he teached me that there is a good side in live, but I lost hope and the will  to try it. The blades will arrive on thursday maybe I wont be strong enough to take it till 2020. I wanted to do therapy 'cuz I was to scared that I will kill myself when nobody is watching me, now is that moment I was so scared of and I'm kinda relieved.

I didnt really take much effort to make sure every word is written correct so I'm sorry for that."
2859,How the fuck did I become the loser living in his mom's basement?,"I'm everything I ever feared I would be, and I had such promise. I was going to go to college, and had several acceptance letters and on school even offered me a presidential scholarship for $10,000 per semester. But I wanted to join the military. So I nailed my entrance exam and was offered my choice of literally any three jobs in the Air Force. But then I decided that I wanted to go to college again, and so I ended up going to a shitty community college and working part-time. 

My life got worse. For years I had no money at all and couldn't afford even a cheap place with a roommate. My depression became so bad that I don't ever leave my room anymore. I don't have any confidence or self-worth. I wish I had been born a female, but my therapist says that I'm in such a bad mental state that I can't decide whether to gender transition or not, and as much as I hate to admit it he's right. I just have to sit back in impotent frustration, keep living with mommy and daddy, watch as my hair falls out and my body gets irreparably uglier and more masculine. 

There's no hope at all."
2860,I want this to be over,I'm always so alone. I hate it. I hate myself for not being good enough. I hate being around people who are always in big happy groups. I want to blow my head off in the center of campus. At least then someone will notice me
2861,I’m stuck,"I want to talk to people irl about it but if I do it’ll jeopardize my ability to go and be myself in another country next month. Ah, the pills are right in front of me and I just want to end it but I lowkey want to live. I want someone to understand I’m in pain, I want it to be real. It feels fake when I’m the only one that knows."
2862,I want to end it all,"hi guys, first time writing here. I’m writing this post out of desperation and need for someone to know how I’ve been in the past years and my final intentions. I’m a 19 year old guy and, to keep it general, I have been abused by my dad when I was 15/16, been bullied since childhood, had a hatred relationship with my family members and am gay in a muslim family, all leading to a failed school year and attempted suicide. Since then my relationship with my mom crashed, family members were horrified by me, motivation to study fell off and to this day I’m still in court against my dad with no result. If I had to describe these past 4 years I wouldn’t say that I was happy or thriving, i experienced depression, anxiety, lack of motivation and a sense of numbness with uncountable thoughts about ending my pain once for all through suicide. Today I had a parents evening and it was already painful to see peers 4 years younger than me, my teachers as usual pointed out to my mom how sad and silent I am all day even though I have my good grades and grades just to pass, I just want to finish this high school drama and I don’t mind to take As’, I’m too tired for that and my reputation is already screwed. I have a dream, I want to work as an interpreter for the european parliament (I’m italian, so english is not my native language) but most of the times I realise that I’m too stupid and broken to aspire so high when I’m struggling with high school still, I just don’t see the point in planning a future if I have mountains to climb along my way. My mom works all day for me and my sister and I’m grateful for that, but we don’t have a relationship, after my attempt she was so broken inside that she told me the worst things that you could imagine and overall is not prone to acknowledge mental health, so I don’t talk about my problems and I bottle my emotions up. I’m just miserable, my teachers still have to deal with me, my mom will never accept me and we’re in the edge of a fallout, I’ll never get to study what I like because everyone discourage me and I just need to end it all. I’m planning on killing myself friday with a rope, even though I don’t want this to affect my friends and sister, they don’t deserve this but I’m just tired of living without support and crying every night to sleep. Help"

2864,"The night is so silent, but my head is not. They said the gods gave life, but this one handed me the gift of death.","I've got a contact list, but no one who really understands. 

It's 2am. I have originally intended to decide whether to kill myself on the 24th after I get my undergrad semester grades. 

I've got no good grades, no girlfriend ever, no money, no supportive family. I've got nothing good.

Today I get more evidence that what I see on the 24th Dec is a disaster. A few days ago I get softly rejected, but actually deep down I know I'm not good enough by her standards.

There's not much reason to wait anymore ain it ?"
2865,I want to kill myself on the 17th,I wanna do it on the 17th but I don't want to leave my dogs alone. If I wait until I get rid of them then it'll be at least February until I can do it. I don't want to wait that long
2866,Anyone else just completely dead inside and is reclusive? Like no emotions. No anger. No hate. Just numb and have completely given up?,"I just stay home pretty much.
I don’t care about myself.
I don’t care about making friends.
I don’t care about talking to the ones I have.
It’s all a countdown to the inevitable."
2867,Anyone else,"Not have any friends, relationships, goals or motivation? The days off from work are the worst. It's too quiet, the thoughts run deep. I can't talk to anyone about how I truly feel anymore without cops showing up at my door for a welfare check or getting accused of harassment because the couple people I do know think it's attention seeking. Anyone else feel hopeless and alone? Sleeping is all that passes the time, it seems."
2868,Just want it over,"Due to financial restraints I can’t go home for holidays and because I have no friends in this area I will be alone. Things keep piling up, there’s no end in sight. I’m at work trying to find ways to kill myself in a place where no one will find me for a while."
2869,I feel like my only way out is suicide,"I'm a 25 years old M. I have been feeling horrible for the last years, I don't have any reason to live, no friends, I was raised my an awful and narcissistic family who abused me, didn't let me use internet or seek help and kicked me out as soon as they could, I have autism, I live in a third world country who doesn't offer any support to people like me, I have no way of income and on top of that I can't even rest because my neighbors are loud and trigger my noise sensitivity relentlessly.  I don't know what stopped me to commit suicide all these years but it wasn't worth it and every day is just another path of suffering, tying to get get jobs or help just to see everything failed until I collapse and dream a few hours having nightmares and wake up just to continue. I don't even know what I'm writing this, maybe just a rant, a loose hope of someone giving a shit or just a way of getting all this off my chest before I go."
2870,Time gentlemen please!,"Is there a time of day that you think more about suicide? I find that although I think about it constantly, it is early mornings after a long night I feel more vulnerable. Its then I really have to fight.  It's 6pm at the moment and reading about someone who is contemplating suicide. I just wish I had the balls to go through with it."
2871,How influential has this subreddit been in deterring your suicide attempt?,This is a genuine question... I’ve posted my thoughts here before as well as responded to other people’s posts on this subreddit
2872,All my peers have good jobs and productive lives. I am 31 and work minimum wage.,"I was always one of the smart ones in my peer group. I aced high school and later university - gaining a first class degree in physics and a master's degree from a top university here in England. They gave me a stipend and everything - very rare in the UK.

That's where my success ends. Somehow I never progressed into a ""real"" adult life. I wasted many years to mental illness and spent a lot of time seeking help. In this time I have been in and out of minimum wage jobs. Thanks to social anxiety I have screwed up more interviews than I can remember.

I remember back in college helping my friend whenever we had chemistry lab. He was really clueless when it came to things like titrations and it was in my nature to lend a hand. He did pretty badly in college but then stayed back a year to repeat. He's a doctor now. Another friend was incredibly quiet and withdrawn. Went to university to do maths and did great, but didn't talk to anyone the whole time. He's an actuary now and works in London. Others are doing things like pharmacy, dental nursing, recruitment, manual trades. Then there's me going nowhere. Applied to medical school a few times and got nowhere. Graduate entry too competitive. Applied to graduate schemes. Again I get nowhere.

Kind of wondering what the point is anymore.

I got shafted by mental illness and a lack of fortune and that just seems to be the long and short of it."
2873,My parents are killing me,"That’s the problem. My parents always yell at me as if I just killed someone in front of them. If they were polite to me, I would never ever have decided to do anything to myself (at least I think so). Is there a way I can do anything about it if they don’t even listen to me?  Their anger forced to me just destroys my motivation and my life in whole."
2874,"It's always the same with me, i just can't kms","I don't know what to do. I am supposed to commit suicide today. But at the end i'm scared. I feel that my end isn't supposed to be now. I think that maybe, my life isn't a waste. Maybe, i can have a future in music. Maybe i can try to do my best to succeed. But i know that even when i try, i fail. And i just can't deal anymore with all that. I can't deal with my bipolar disorder anymore. I can't deal with my fails ane my wish to have a place in the music field. Only the best can live thx to music, but my place isn't among the best. I always have hope again, when i am in a suicidal crisis. But then, life will continue, and i'll feel despair again. Big despair. Everyone has up and down, but some people have TOO DOWN downs. I can't do this anymore... But i even fail at gathering the courage to kms. I just have to die. I must die. But at the end, i always feel like this is wrong..."
2875,My plan,"I have battled depression since I was 12 and started thinking of suicide at 15. I'm 20 now. I have a loving bf and a sweet newborn son. I love them both so much. They are the center of my world. They're what keep me going and tear me down at the same time. I got pregnant very quickly and my bf wonders if our baby is even his sometimes. He is. I know it. I hadn't been with anyone for so long. If my bf isn't the father, then I wouldn't have had a baby.

I can't breastfeed my baby anymore. I took pride in it honestly. Pumping was just as rewarding. We just supplemented with formula when needed, which wasn't often, and I was okay with that. It worked well. My bf decided to put the baby on formula only. He thought it was better. I still don't agree but when my bf ""joked"" that I was starving our baby because I wasn't able to pump enough for that day, I stopped pumping all together. It was like a kick to the gut. He might as well have said I was a shit mother. I'm trying the best I can. I'm 20. He's 24. Neither of us were ready but committed to it anyways. I'm trying.

I've been struggling in school too and if I don't pass all my classes this semester, I'm going to be kicked out of college. My parent's financial support will end with my being kicked out and I'll have to give them my car back since it's theirs technically and are only letting me use it while I'm in school. No more money help, I'll be taken off their insurance, they won't see me anymore in general. They won't even act as grandparents for my baby because they'll be so dissappointed in me for failing school.

I think I might do it if I don't pass my classes. It will be the best for everyone. I won't be a burden on my bf. He can do so much better than me anyways. Our baby won't be hurt financially. I know he'll cry for me at first, but he'll get used to it. He won't remember me when he gets older. I can't feed him anymore so what use am I? My bf can have his space back and won't feel like he has to worry about me anymore. I have health issues that are expensive. No one will have to deal with that anymore. I won't tell anyone I failed my classes. My parents will help support my bf and our son if something like my sudden death happened. They won't know my grades. They won't know I failed. My bf won't know I failed classes. Only as a mother.

It hurts. Part of me doesn't want to. Part of me wants to watch my baby grow up. I want to marry my bf. I want to be happy. I haven't been for so long though. I'm on antidepressants. They aren't helping anything. I'm not comfortable seeing a therapist. I'm trying to pass my classes. It's finals week. I'm studying my ass off as much as I can while I take care of my son. I iust don't think I can keep living if I fail at another huge thing in life. It would be better financially and mentally better for everyone if I just wasn't here."
2876,I'm done,"Life is just a downward spiral of insanity, betrayal, and disappointment. I hate waking up everyday to the same shitty routine. I can't even feel anymore so what's the point in going on? I don't even care if anyone is hurt by my passing because they never showed care while I was here."
2877,I quit,"The whole point of my being was to be the shield the shit hit. Uncle, stepfather even neighbour.
I took the assaults, the night visits the beatings &amp; I tried to get help only to be told I was lying.
I can’t do it anymore, every chance I get of being happy I’m suspicious &amp; scared to the point where I sabotage myself.
Just to escape the pain to be nothing.
I know now that I’m the monster, who has that many things happen to them, who knows that many people who has hurt them, logic &amp; probability says it must be me.
I have no strength left, no fight left &amp; no will."
2878,I... Don't even fucking know what to write in this title,"I already feel like a attention whore for posting on this subreddit. But anyways my life has gone down the drain and I don't even know why it just went all to hell I just started to get super depressed and I don't know what to do I have stopped going to school and I just play video games all day. I feel like shit if I feel anything at all  I completely stopped caring for anything and the only thing that's left is a chunk of hope smaller than an atom that it might get better that I might get my life back together but even that is fading day for day. My Mother has similar problems and is not in a good position to help me, my Father I haven't seen since I was 5 the only family member that might be able to help me through this is my step-grandfather but I don't want to talk to him because he has always been more of a role model and I don't want him to be disappointed in me. The shitty thing is that it seems to be genetic because my Mother, my grandmother my uncle have these problems my grandmother even killed herself. I just really don't know what to do now. My Mother wants me to go to a clinic or somewhere like to my step-grandfather I know it's so I'm with people who can take better responsibility than her but I still feel like shit because of that and I just wanna die but every time I decide to do an attempt on my life I get scared I the last seconds and bail and after that I feel like a pussy because I was too scared to do it. Why am I even writing this shit it's useless anyway"
2879,I’m going to kill myself fuck my shit life I’m fucking worthless unwanted trash,I can’t do anything feel like fucking shit
2880,I was writing a note,"I was writing a note, and I decided to go see the school counselor. long story short I think I'm actually going to be on suicide watch, I'm in the detention room right now but I'm not in detention, just being watched. But there's a funny thing about this, when I went to the office I left my backpack and laptop. On that laptop I was writing a suicide note. I came back to get my stuff. When I looked back at this note, I found an addition to this note. And I can only guess it was my best friend writing it, but here it is, ""I will not need this note, because even though I believe ive lost hope, im afraid. Not of death, but because the chance that my future will be bright again. I would have left my friends without ever knowing what the future held for me. I will not need this note. Because i have friends who won't let it happen, even if they have to do everything in their power to do so. They can help me, and they will. I will not need this note."" And now I'm sitting here, thinking that he read all of that."
2881,"It's odd. Right now I'm tired and tired of living, but not actively suicidal.","Rejected, constantly picked on by people younger than me, over stressed. I'd do it if it weren't for my friends and family. I keep getting visions of me doing something detrimental. People know I've self-harmed and have seen me do it blatantly.

I'm told to always tell people but at this point I'd like to deal with things alone again. My depressive attitude basically got publicised and that's the worst thing. If I ever feel happy I look at everyone else feeling dejected while I know that eventually I'll be toxic again or will fall back into depression, I always do."
2882,It's over,"The world sucks. I'm tired of living on this garbage fire we call Earth. It never gets better, and all anyone can offer for ""help"" is empty words and suicide lines.

The suicide lines are dangerous. I won't use them.

I'm going to kill myself today. Just needed to tell someone."
2883,Suicidal because gambling took it all,"Feeling worse then ever.3rd time gambled this year..

How family can trust me? They cant.I have new solutions to overcome this and be more ""safe"", but i dont want to spread pain again.

They can get heart attack cause of me.Im serious.. I just did this like 1 months, gambled too and they felt sick.

And again in this shit.You cant imagine how much you destroy other overs this addiction.

They should give up on me, gave me too many chances.I can pick additional work for weekends, im in debt 11500 and i would got 1600 additionally so after 8 months i can pay it back

I wrote suicide note too, i dont know how to stay alive"
2884,"I don't get people who respond to suicidal / depressive posts with ""Don't do it God loves you ... ""","Pastor in our church told us that God will put only so much weight on you that you can lift . Clearly some people like me can't lift as much as God desires and are crushed beneath it . 

If God loved us / existed he wouldn't want us to feel hopeless knowing we have nothing left keeping us alive here . 

I am 17M and the only thing keeping me here is my friend who used to be suicidal too . He told me that if I kill myself , he is going to do it too . (I know he isn't bluffing)"
2885,My father made his second suicide attempt this morning,"I feel completely powerless to help him and need support. What can I do?

Any positive energy being sent his way would be completed appreciated."
2886,I will never amount to anything,"I'm in my second year of college. Finals have started, and grades are starting to come back. Last fall I got over involved with varsity sports and my grades suffered, but I didn't drop the sports teams until it was too late and my grades were almost irreparable. In the spring, I worked at it and got my GPA to a point where I'd be able to keep my scholarship, but it's not nearly as competitive as it needs to be for when I get to grad school. This semester to felt better about things, but after just getting back my biology final grade, I once again feel hopeless and useless. I go to UNC, and granted it's a tough school and the science classes are rough, but there are students here who have 3.8/3.9 GPAs taking the same classes as I do. Those are the kids that are going to get into grad school, med school, and law school, while I'll be stuck doing the runt work that nobody else has to do because I'm not good enough. 

I know this may be coming from a place of privilege, being that I go to a top university and I know I'm lucky to be here, but oftentimes I feel I don't belong here. I'm nowhere near as smart as everyone else and have no chance of getting into post-undergraduate schools when competing against other students in my class. 

My GPA is currently a 3.048, possibly getting up to a 3.130 after this semester. Last fall, it was a 2.878. Granted it's now much higher than it used to be, it's not good enough. 

Since starting college, I've been struggling. My grades are low, I have very few friends, and while I have a great support system, I always feel alone. I have GAD and PTSD to top it all off. I just don't think I can do it anymore. Everything's getting to be too much, my low grades prove to me that I won't be able to go anywhere after graduating, if I even get to that point, and I'll never amount to anything."
2888,A girl just crushed the remainder of my happiness,"Ive been talking to this girl for a few months and we have both gotten to know each other quite well. We both loved each other very much and she knew that i loved her with all my being, but today after months of talking to me and saying how much i meant to her, she told me just now that she has a boyfriend. So all those months shes been telling me how much I mean to her and all those nights i stayed up just to talk with her were all for nothing. I just feel really empty inside right now, i literally had a mental breakdown in the shower and just fell to the floor and just started crying over and over. She meant everything to me and made me so happy and now she left me like twice as worst as before i met her. I dont even know what to do anymore, i just want to fucking die."
2889,I dont think my mom loves me anymore.,"Its just that, she insults me. Every day, no matter what Im doing, she has something to say. She took away the Internet, my Ps4, and even her car ride to school. She wants me to be better. I get that. But she yells at me. She calls me ugly. She calls me lazy. She calls me a failure. Ive been trying to shrug it off but its taken a toll on me. Im not her son, to her Im just a burden."
2890,"I feel like everyone is against me, except probably a couple of people, and so much other crap is happening. I don't think I can take feeling like this.","Drama with my ex-best friend caused me to relapse and have a PTSD attack for almost two weeks straight. I had dreams every night, sometimes multiple a night, about being brutally raped by whomever. They were so traumatic, I would sometimes have flashbacks to my dreams. 

My ex-best friend was involved with a guy who was accused by multiple for sexual assault. She never believed me, so I decided to stop being friends with her for my mental health. She then called me an idiotic whore, a fake ass bitch, and a stupid fucking dumbass. I cried and relapsed that day multiple times. My girlfriend was kind of defending her, saying that it was her defending herself because she was hurt. Now all of my ex-best friend's close friends hate my guts, and one threatened to hurt me. I think the only people that I feel aren't against me are my two other partners, who both understand the situation and said I did the right thing. My PTSD and anxiety are so bad lately, I'm paranoid one of her friends are going to corner me and beat me. Sometimes I wish though that they would just beat me up so bad that I die from my injuries. Or that they hit me with a car hard enough to die instantly. 

I'm so angry, scared, and just upset. My thigh burns and hurts, I can't focus on anything but the blade under my bed. I don't see my therapist till January, but that's too long. She's busy too, so it's not like we can schedule sooner. 

I just wish I wasn't treated like a piece of disgusting soggy food left in the sink that no one wants to touch so they ignore it hoping it'll disappear. I just want to stop existing, but who will take care of my dog and guinea pigs? no one, because I'm the only one in the house who actually takes care of shit. I feed my siblings and clean up most of the house every night and feed the animals because if I don't do all those things in one night I get yelled at.

I can't take 2 more years of this shit."
2891,I want this shit show of a life to be over.,"I’m in the worst relationship i can even imagine. I wake up every single day telling myself today is going to be the day. I’ve tried overdosing - didn’t work. I’ve tried suffocation, random drugs, cutting. Nothing fucking works, I’m literally so useless I can’t even kill myself. Imagine that. I can’t see my family or friends, I work overtime and usually 7 days a week, I’m trapped in my own apartment. Talked to dozens of cops, there’s no proof he’s hitting me. Harassing messages won’t hold up. When I leave, he texts me foul things from friends phones, my car door got kicked in, mirror got ripped off. I can’t get a restraining order, though I’ve tried, because ya know, it’s a bit hard setting my phone up to record before I get my ass kicked, when I don’t even know when that’ll be half the time. I’ve talked to the leasing office, cops, even called the non emergency line. It’s a he said she said, until someone is dead. Might just piss him off one night so bad, and just let him kill me. And everyone makes it out to be so easy, trust me I’ve tried everything. Not so fucking easy. I’m just done. I’m so empty, and numb. I hate everything and mostly myself."
2892,Where do we go when we die?,
2893,I just need someone to talk to,My brain is going insane with sadness
2894,I should be better,"I have no reason to feel the way that I do. My life is fine. I’m working. I have a wife. I have a family that loves me, but I still just want to die. I come here and read these post some times, and I see people going through terrible things, and I can understand and empathize, but I have no reason to feel the way I do. Which makes me feel more guilty. It feels like a hole I can’t get out of. I know people would be hurt if I killed myself, but I’m hurting everybody constantly by being miserable and having no explanation for it. So I think just one last big hurt would be better for everyone. I have a plan, but I don’t know when I’ll do it...just when I’ve decided I’m done hurting people I guess."
2895,i just want to die,i want to pour the most flammable substance in my house on my self and just light myself on fire. or maybe i wanna stab myself. i just can’t live. i keep on imagining myself killing myself and i want it to be a reality. everyday feels like my final day. it’s too much.
2896,Please help me,"Hello everyone, I am one of those people who want to kill my self. Because, I am dumb and don’t deserve to live in this life. I know I act selfish or something like that... I can’t hold my self anymore. My problems are pretty simple for many of you, and that why I hate myself. I am senior, and will gratitude (maybe) I failed most of my classes and I don’t know how this happens, I always try my best, but I can’t. I am disappointing my parents and my whole family, I will probably fail my college application, and I will stay in my hometown doing some shit for my dad, and won’t be able to get a job that I want it. I want to be a producer, but my family don’t like that idea and they will not allow me to study for producer. I don’t know what to do now, I can’t hold it anymore. I know if I will kill myself everyone who knows me will miss me, especially my family. But I don’t know what to do, die and they will miss me. Or I will be whole problem for my family that they will be shame on me. Pls help me people I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!"
2897,High risk point,"I’ve had attempts in the past. Usually abut once
A year.
These past 4 weeks I’ve had a belt / noose around my neck at least once a week, and every night the past 3 days. Usually I just stand there dissociating until I come to my senses. Three times I had the balls to apply pressure enough to get very dizzy. Once enough to blackout but to awake later cursing at my foul luck. 
I’ve begun self harming, which is a new for me. 
This morning I had the noose around my neck within an hour of awaking. One of these days I won’t be such a coward. On that note I might go buy a large bottle of hard liquor."
2898,Who thinks the same?,"Life is meaningless, go to school, graduate and get a job, get married, make kids, get old, and die.  
The life of a human in a single sentence, is just boring, what can I do if I don't want kids, I don't want to marry, I don't want to fucking work 8-10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week, if I had money? then what? I don't have a use for them, I don't get any joy from buying stuff, all I do all day is stay in bed, go to work, eat, sleep and piss and shit, I stay on my phone all day and before going to sleep I try to come up with an idea to kill myself.  
Sad? depressed? I am not, not every suicidal person have a stupid reason like love or sadness, I am just so bored that I want to stop being alive right now, I don't want to see the world in the same colored way others do, all I see is stupidity and people's greed, just an endless circle, the same routine, and even if I'd go out and do something else I would still get bored fast.   
If I got to the point that every new and old experience is a boring dread for me and nothing else, than what should I do? go on living? Fuck no! If I'll ever be luck enough to meet a robber or a killer I will take the chance to get them to kill me, and if a gun ever falls in my hands, oh shit, not a moment of hesitation\*&gt;BOOM&lt;\* straight to the head. 

You know what the most given advice for people that are suicidal because of an existential reason? Do something that will distract you from these thoughts! Really? distract me? So wait those thoughts should't be negated? shouldn't they try to prove it wrong? that life is worth living? NO, just distraction from those ideas, forget about them. The thing is that everybody fells the same even if they don't admit it, and if they don't fell like this for the moment is because they don't think about it, again they DON'T think about it, that is the reason they are happy, so wait we shouldn't think logical, we should be ignorant, that way life will not become boring and lose it's meaning?

I am part of the people that just look at everything logical and I can almost always tell how a situation will turn out, that makes everything boring, so how can I not be suicidal in this situation? and just for people to understand, no I'm not sad, just bored of life and absolutely nothing helps me.

Anybody felling the same?"
2899,"I tried once last night, and I’m going to try once again this morning.","It’s currently 8:05 am as I write this, and I’m sitting in my bed wondering why I’m still alive.  

*Why am I still here? Why didn’t it work last night? Why can’t I just have the courage or the guts to go through with it?*  

I lied to everyone about how I’m doing. I told them I’m fine when I know very well I’m not okay at all and I need help. I need someone. But yet I keep pushing away all my help and in the end I’m suffering. I’m doing this to myself.  

I’m a burden to everyone. I don’t deserve to be here and everyone will be better off without me. I know I had plans for my future and I hope my friends will carry some of the plans we devised together out for me.  

I hope my boyfriend knows I love him and will watch him from above. I hope my parents know they were a abusive fucks that drove me to the edge. I hope they’re all aware that I love them all so deeply.  

Dear Reddit, thank you for your help and suppprt. For the random users that stood by me and helped me when I needed them most. That pmed me and commented on my posts to make sure I’m okay. I don’t know you all that well, but nonetheless I appreciate your support and I love you all."
2900,Why,"What did I do to make this life so hard? I’m in so much fucking pain. Every time I try to make things better, they only get worse. My body hurts and I’m mentally exhausted.  Being who I am at 20 just makes me want to hang myself. I know people look at me with such disgust. They don’t realize how much I wanna end it all. I’m trying to be happy but every sign is telling me to give up. It’s not worth this fight. I’m just filled with bottled emotions but mostly rage. I’m so close to ending it all and I’m trying to find the best way to do it. But, knowing my luck, I might fuck everything up."
2901,Can’t escape,Can’t escape this constant fucking disappointment. I disappoint everyone around me. I had all intentions of just letting the drugs take over me. Now the only thing stopping me is actually having people waiting. But that’s almost done and can’t disappoint anyone much longer.
2902,i didnt do it but i lost my 2 month streak of being clean from self harm,
2903,I’m getting potentially life saving treatment for my depression and need someone to come with me. Is anyone willing to help me?,"I can’t believe it has even come to this but here it goes .

I am getting treatment for my severe and chronic depression and pain. If anyone is willing to help me I will dm them more details. The place I am getting the treatment says I have to have a family member, partner or friend to come with me and check I don’t have any bad reactions for a while after. 

My parents are abroad and are not supporting me in any way. We don’t have a great relationship. I feel weird asking one of my friends as I do not want to feel judged.

I would pay for someone’s travel, accommodation and money for the inconvenience. I desperately need some relief and am running out of options. People think it may be stupid and risky of me to be willing to travel with a stranger, but what options do I have? 

It’s a messed up situation I know."
2904,might do it,
2905,"Before anyone thinks this is a troll post, I’m actually serious about this question. Why stop or discourage suicide? People have the right to do what they want to their body. Stopping people from killing themselves is restricting their right to take their life.",Personally I think it is absolutely disgraceful to tel people to not kill themselves.
2906,I tried to kill myself last night,"I don’t know if I should tell anyone or not. It wasn’t anything serious or a serious attempt. I was more so doing it in the heat of the moment type thing, plus it was half assed since my mom was nearby at the time.  

I know if I tell someone they’ll freak out and the last thing I want is to end up back in the psych ward. I also know if I keep it in that’s risky and I might try again sometime ahhhh  

I’m honestly betting on it considering this an attempt and calling it a day; carrying on with my life and acting like nothing ever happened. Even though that means I might try again sometime. Good chances are I’ll tell someone eventually because I’ll feel bad for not sharing something so serious."
2907,Seeing Older Posts,"We all see some positive posts from people fighting their own battles, but it hurts to see half of these posts are from Deleted accounts. 

Makes me worry they lost their battles.

Heartbreaking"
2908,I’m a failure and there’s no way out,"I’m 22. I should have gotten my bachelors already. But I only just became a college junior. I kept failing classes at my old college because it was a horrible place for me. I was being threatened by my roommates for god knows what and I don’t live in the dorm anymore but the environment I was in fucked with my ability to keep up with and even attend class. Im passing most of my classes with d grades but I’m failing one of them and there’s nothing I can do to save my grades. It’s finals week now. Even if I manage to ace my exam perfectly I will still have an f. I’m so fucking out of control of my life. I’m poor, I can’t afford to fail. All the people I graduated in high school with are already with degrees, starting their careers, or are going into grad school. I’m off my medications. I can’t go to the doctor and get more meds because I have no insurance because Medicaid won’t speed up the process to get me insured. My roommates have royally fucked my life up and I’m too scared to file a police report. I don’t even know what I did to them, I did what was expected of me and tried to keep out of everyone’s way. I have ptsd from child abuse, they made it even worse. I’m cutting again. I worked so hard to get better, and I was doing great with my progress in therapy. I can’t sleep unless I drink heavily or take NyQuil because I don’t have any more medication that helps my insomnia. I throw up daily. I can’t eat and if I do I either throw up or become ill.

 I only have one parent and she doesn’t support me because I’m transgender. My father abandoned what’s left of my family when I was 10, doesn’t pay child support, doesn’t insure me or the other children, and emptied my college fund (about 30k). He pretends to be homeless while sitting on 20 years worth of a 6 figure income and then some which he pisses away on alcohol, whores, and an empty lot of foreclosed land. When he lived with me, he starved and prevented us from seeing friends or going to school. He set up webcams throughout the house connecting back to his office. He may have left when I was 10, but his abuse continued. He left us in a pest ridden home, would break in when we weren’t home so he could deface, urinate on the carpets and furniture, and would steal. The ant infestation was so bad that at school I would find ants on my body, on my belongings, and crawling on the floor from me during class. I didn’t get out of that he’ll hold until I was 18.

By the time I graduate with my bachelors, I’ll be 50k in debt. I can’t even comprehend how much that is and it doesn’t even fucking include grad school. I am going to school so I can get into med school. It’s fucking ironic when I’m so fucking unwell. My mom thinks I’m pathetic because I graduated in the top 10% of my senior class in high school and that I’m wasting money in college barely getting by. I have no friends. I can’t make friends. I was as kind as I could be with my roommates. I did something wrong, but I don’t know what in the fuck I did to deserve being pushed around and threatened. 

I just want to fucking tap out. I can’t even kill myself properly because I’m out of medication. I can’t get a gun because gun laws are strict here. I’m tempted to just piss off a cop so they can shoot me instead, it’s not too difficult to do that in this day and age. I am truly a failure, and there’s nothing I can do to fix my life. I’m too fucked up for help to do anything anymore."
2909,Hurting too much,"I don’t have any intrinsic reasons to be alive. I don’t kill myself because I’m too much of a coward and I don’t want to make anybody else upset. 

Every single day feels worse than the last one. I don’t really want to hurt or kill myself. But I don’t have anyone to reach out to. I really want to text my ex. He used to be the light of my life  but I’m not his problem anymore. 

I truly don’t feel like being alive anymore. I don’t have any reason to believe that there is anything good coming to me in this world. 

I truly feel that I’m at the end. I can’t take this pain much longer."
2910,It's always the same,"Other people can do whatever they want, with little to no consequences, but when I fail, I end up being rejected and treated with indifference.

What's the point? I've endured a decade filled with suffering, rejection, mistake after mistake, indifference, being laughed at, being used and then discarded, what's the freaking point then?!

Sorry if I was selfish yesterday, one of the reasons I'm feeling down is that all of the family members I'm living with are physically ill one way or another... All of them fell prey of different illnesses in just two months, it's not fair... I know my suffering is nothing compared to others, but I don't know what have we done to deserve this..."
2911,"For once, I just want to stop being the punchline of everyone's jokes.",
2913,Not Brave Enough to end it,"Each day I live is the worst day of my life each moment is worse than the next I'm 32 years old with a defective body caused by mutiple hospitals and doctors incompetents. Im forced to live with my parents because my disability money barely covers bills and I don't even have much money left for food. I can not work, if I did work I loose my disability and insurance. but my leg and spine are destroyed so there's no work I can do anyway since I can only stand or sit for 20 minutes at a time and I have to lay down frequently. So here I lay 8am in my personal hell with a mother who treats  my father and I like shit who yells at me for using the bathroom or touching her stove or dishes if I try to make myself something to eat. Why do I keep living, each day is worse and each moment is pain and suffering. I have nothing and no one except for a horrible mother who has berated me my entire life and told me how inferior I am to her favorite child. The funny thing is a year ago I had a successful career money and a fiance. All it took was one medical problem and 3 stupid hospitals to make sure my body was forever broken and now my mental pain almost out ways the physical suffering I endure every second of my life."
2914,"Failing school, failing life","I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and mental health issues since the wee age of 11. 

Back in school, no one ever wanted to be my friend, lest they get bullied mercilessly by everyone. I don't know what I did to make people hate me this much, I just knew that I did and that there was something inherently wrong with me.

So I spent my youth playing video games to make me forget how much I hated myself. I developed an addiction to it - playing WoW for 15 hours during weekends and for 8 hours during weekdays. 

I quit school early and spent my late teenage years in several mental hospitals to find out what was wrong with me. Turns out it's a lot - I suffer from PTSD, depression that sometimes becomes psychotic during particularly bad episodes (where I seriously believe that I am worse than Hitler), severe paralysing anxiety, autism, DID, etc. I basically collect mental illnesses like Pokémon.

My life is a permanent mental health episode. 

So what happened in the recent years? I started night school. I still live with my mother at the age of 22, rent free.

And I'm failing the third exam in a row. Why? Because my video game addiction destroys my sense of priorities. But when I don't play, I suddenly remember how depressed I am and I hate that.

I can't hold down a job either so it's not like I'm gonna be useful. All the jobs I had let me go after a month or so when they realised that I'm not good at anything and that I take *a lot* of mental health days. I'm not a functioning member of society and it's unlikely that I'll ever be. 

So why not kill myself?"
2915,I can't cope with life anymore,"Life is just too much. I feel like being a human is too complex and I can't understand any of it.
I want out. Works stressing me, not being at work depresses me because i think way more. All i want to do is self harm, i want someone to kill me because im too pathetic to even manage that. I feel overwhelmed but at the same time i feel like theres nothing to be overwhelmed by. I just need everything to end."
2916,Just need someone to talk to,I just want to chat a bit you know just to forget the real world a little
2917,What do u think is better: leaving a suicide note or not ?,"I was used to believe that leaving one is better, but i begin to think that it's not. I'm thinking of not leaving one"
2918,Suicidal thoughts are creeping in for the first time in my life,"I've just been through a pretty bad break up with who I thought was the woman of my dreams. There's been a lot of emotional ups and downs between the two of us over the last few days. ""I love you and I miss you"" has been thrown in there a lot. Wanting to stay connected and be friends, and now shes ghosting me. It's been like this for the past week and the loneliness, the depression, the lack of ambition or drive to do anything. No joy in anything I do. My friends are fed up with me already. I cant take the mental torture any more. I go to bed not wanting to wake up. Just to have a heart attack and die. I've researched ways to bring them on. I've thought about ways I'd want to do it and different techniques are becoming more appealing by the day. I'm afraid to tell my family and friends incase they think I'm trying to ruin their lives even further. 
I just want it to stop."
2919,I’m here waiting (don’t know what for),"I have my ‘device’ made, in a room booked. Expecting to call emergency services at the last minute so they can find me and not an innocent person. Not sure why I’m sharing this. It’s a very strange feeling finally being here. Having thought about it for so so so long. It’s a very strange day. 

I hope you all find fulfilment, in whichever way that is for you. Can you do emojis on reddit? 🌻🌻🌻🌻 sunflowers"
2920,Cannot Fuckin' Get a Proper Job,"Every advertisement asks for at least 2 years of experience, a bunch of requirements like, be highly motivated, be flexible and highly available even on the weekend (basically do as we please), have great communication skills, have skills that they didn't even teach in college particular to the profession, be a fast learner and dedicated (basically die for this shit job), be good with people (I fuckin' hate people), do everything perfectly (or you'll be fucked basically), be fluent in multitasking. 

I fuckin' hate this piece of shit country, they ask all this shit for an entry level job. Yet, how the fuck are you supposed to have 2 years of experience when you're 21 and have just finished school? Even if you apply someone else who has 5 years of experience and a PhD will steal the entry from you. No thanks, fuck this world. I don't want to stay anymore, there's no use. Currently, I barely manage to live from charring, but it's not life, just living paycheck to paycheck. It's not a life. It's fuckin' slavery. Good bye, farewell."
2921,I have a plan and I've already written my note. I need help.,"This is my last resort to post here. I have no support in real life. I already have a plan to kill myself and I wrote my suicide note.

I'm 25 and my life has been falling apart for months now. My girlfriend of 4 years left me in August and practically had a brand new life lined up for her. It barely even phased her that I was around. My friends have been drifting apart from me, sometimes I go entire days without hearing from anyone. I got my driver's license revoked about a month ago. I'm slowly losing everything. And it's just confirming in my mind that I should go through with it because I have nothing anyways.

I'm not even afraid of the fact that I'm going to go through with it. I'm just sad that not a single person I know has made a genuine effort to try and help me. I don't have a lot of friends but the ones I tried to reach out to said a few words and gave some advice but never offered to help me beyond that. I must be a really shitty person that no one can make time for me.

I can't afford therapy and even if I could I work during the hours that it's offered. I was on antidepressants for awhile but they just made me feel empty and emotionless. There doesn't seem to be any other options. I have no energy left to try and fix things myself. This seems like my only option."
2922,How can i find the courage to kms,"Everything in the title, I have the tools but cant use them"
2923,"A ramble/vent, just a way to clear my head a bit","I have therapy in a couple of hours, I don't think it's really working. I mean, for a while the thoughts of killing myself were replaced with a possible future, a possible existence I could be happy with. 
Then suddenly like a storm it overwhelmed me and now I think it'd just be easier to save everyone the trouble and just fucking do it already. In my mind, I know everyone would be sad for a while, but truth be told they'd grieve and get over it. I'm so sick and feel sick. 
So many times I feel like I shouldn't have existed in the first place, that i'm just floating through life. I'm okay with the thought of life having no meaning, of existence being nothing past its dictionary definition; but holy shit can I atleast be fucking happy? I want the effort and free reign to make my own purpose but my self-esteem is so low and my motivation is non-existent. My life feels like my inevitable end will just be killing myself. No matter what I do, no matter what steps I take or help I get i'm just going to kill myself. One day something will just finally push me over that edge and i'm dead. With those thoughts comes the hopelessness and then the sadness and feeling of worthlessness.
I'm scared of starting a life that I'll never finish.
I'm so drained and tired, I just want to be happy, to be content. 
But everything I want I can't do and everything I need I can't have. It's a self-eating pity party that spirals in a paradox of feeling sorry for myself and then feeling like a piece of shit for doing so. 
So many a time I find myself questioning if it's depression? Simple laziness? Do I just want it to be simple laziness because that's easier to fix? Am I just pretending to not know the real answer to waste more time as justification for my inactivity to start anything or commit? 
I hate being stuck in my head so much, I seem so self-absorbed. In a way I kind of am self-absorbed in my self-loathing, does that even make any sense?
I don't JUST want to cure myself for myself. Sure I want happiness, but i'll be damned if I don't want to give it too.
I always reflect on any off-handed complimented i've received, they're not many but they're treasured. I'd love to get over myself, get over my anxiety and be able to just fucking at the bare minimum COMPLIMENT people. I'd fucking be so damn happy if I could just tell a stranger that I liked their shirt, but I can't even do that. 
In general I would just like to help people. I know logically the world does have its goods as well as its bad. The most I can do and have only ever tried to do is not be part of the bad. 
When I think about it, I get hopeful. But as I said, in my mind i'm just going to kill myself; and my thoughts perverse and tell me that's how I can be part of the good."

2925,About to get academically suspended. Thinking about ending it.,"After a year of recovery and absence from my university, I got to go back. This quarter has been hell. I’m connected to resources on campus. I have a therapist. I just couldn’t perform. I meet with the dean later this week. I can’t face my family. I’m about to get evicted.

2926,fight on people &lt;3,"I used to be suicidal like a lot of people on this sub-reddit. I used to do a lot of self-harm too because I thought maybe if I did it, I would just bleed to death so I don't have to continue with this miserable life. Nobody would care either way, right? I'm sorry but you're wrong. There's a lot of people that cares for you. I recovered because of my close friends who showed me there was more to life than what was given to me already. Sure, sometimes I get shamed for not doing my tasks properly by my family members and sometimes my suicidal thoughts come back but I fight on so I hope that you guys too, will fight on. &lt;3"

2928,Why does the world feel so cold?,Straight up it's like s refrigerator out there. Where are the good people? Do they exist? I don't know how to restore my faith in people. I'm very alone. Last night I laid in bed dreaming of slitting my wrists. I deeply despise humanity.

2930,I feel so impossibly alone,"Every single day, every single fucking day, I hide behind this stupid mask.

It’s like I’m an actor in a one man play, and the audience is my peers, watching me smile and wave and play this perfect little persona I’ve created, day in, day out.

It’s almost like I’m stuck in this make believe world that I’ve created, a world where I mask my true feelings by saying I’m “just tired”, or “I’m fine”.

I play the supportive friend, the one who tries to fix everything, the one who tries as hard as possible to make things better when my friends too, show me their self harm scars, or open up to me about their troubles. The one you would least expect to be suicidal.

The thing is, I am.
Everything in my life is going to absolute shit at the moment, and I don’t know how to deal with it anymore.

It’s all stupid, tiny shit, or most of it anyway, but it all builds up.

There’s the dumb, basic stuff, like how unattractive I am, or how my grades are falling, and the pressure put on me by adults in my life to do good at school is making me feel like I’m drowning.

Then there’s my friends, whom I love to bits, but sometimes their actions, and my actions when it comes to them unintentionally push me even deeper into this dark hole I’ve seem to fallen into.

One of my friends has found newer, better friends than me and hasn’t hung around me for a while because of it. 
Another is lovely, but super judgemental about people self harming because a lot of people in her past have only done it for attention. 
The third overreacts to everything so she’s not an option to talk to, besides, I never see her because she started homeschooling recently.
And my final close friend is super supportive when it comes to this, he and my ex (I told him when we were still dating) are the only two people in my life who know about my depression.. or whatever this is, but we’re constantly getting into arguments over pointless shit so I don’t want to tell him too much.

See, so far it’s just.. stupid teenage drama. Nothing special.

Anyway, my parents are also factors into this equation.
They can be.. really hard to deal with sometimes. I love them, and I know they love me too, but some things they say, and do, hit really close to home.

I’m not a perfect child, that is for sure, I fuck up and lash out in arguments, and I don’t always do what I’m told. My parents usually combat this by calling me names which, yeah, it really hurts. I can’t even count on my fingers the amount of times I’ve been called something crude, today alone.
Sometimes it escalates into physical violence, but not anything too bad, and I know they don’t mean to do it.
Usually it’s just shit like being slapped across the head, or held up against a wall by my collar, which is ok because at least I’m not actually being beat.
I understand too, cause yeah, I can be pretty hard to deal with sometimes, although it doesn’t make what they do hurt any less.

Lastly, this one is a new development, but I think it contributes a lot to how I’ve been feeling recently, but.. my dad is dying.

Or at least, he’s not supposed to live past the next three years.

He’s not going to see me graduate, or walk me down the aisle, or anything I wish he would be around to do.

So yeah. I don’t really want to dwell on that side of things too much because I’m tearing up already.

I can’t talk to anyone about this because my friends, as I’ve stated, aren’t really great options, and besides, they’re supposed to be my friends, not my therapists; this is definitely above their pay grade.

I can’t tell my parents either, because however understanding, they don’t always listen, and they don’t always believe me when I say I’m having mental health issues.

For example, I have a history of OCD.
Not like, shit that people say they have when they can’t stand having a pencil out of place or something, but actual Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

When I was 11 I had HOCD, and talked to my mum about it almost every night until it went away, and she seemed fine with dealing with me then.

However, last year (I was 13) I had Harm OCD, and I talked to my parents about it a little bit before they began to say I was quote unquote “making it up to spend time with them” and that it was “bullshit and I should stop lying for attention”. (Not even kidding, they actually said that)

So, you’d get why I wouldn’t really want to talk to them about mental health stuff again.

I don’t have any trusted teachers I want to talk to, and I’m NOT going to go to a school councillor, or any form of councillor or therapist whatsoever.

Basically, I’ve got no one to turn to, so my last resort is reddit.

The amount of suicidal thoughts I’ve had in the past hour alone is terrifying, and although I wouldn’t act on them (I’m too scared), I just wanted to get this out and vent to someone.

That’s all I guess."
2931,I feel like dead weight to everyone I know and I want to fucking dissapear because of it,"It's everyone, my family, my friends, I just feel like I'm making everyone's like worse for being around.
My mom has told me countless times in her rages that I don't do anything, that I don't help in any way, that she prefers my stepbrother over me, and even I can see that, sometimes they could be talking for hours and I try to add something and I always get interrupted, and it just makes me feel like I'm not fucking worth anything and a second thought.
And my friends? God, I could talk for hours about this, i feel like I try too hard to fit in around them and I just end up making myself look like an asshole, one of them straight up calls me names and we've fought a couple of times, and I feel like dead weight, I'm a sad fucking sack and a total emotional blob, I cry over my grades because I'm scared my mom would hit me (she hasn't hit mw recently, but she did do it alot until around 12-13, I'm 14 now, and I guess I'm a little traumatised)
And they have to deal with my crying ass and calm me down awkwardly when I know they don't know what to do.
And I'm a very ranting person, I like to rant over anything, and I feel like i BORE them...like they don't really want to hear what I'm saying.
And I even did this to my girlfriend on accident, she was in alot of stress and I just kept ranting and ranting to her and she even cried at her homecoming and never told me because I made her sit in a corner and calm me because I had had a bad time and was basically crying over the other side of the phone, and she just never told me, and then later she told me that I rant alot, and that the homecoming thing happened, and I was just....shocked.
We broke up, I felt like she didn't like me anymore, but we're still friends!! Kinda...
I feel like I bother her.
I just wish I could fucking die and never bother anyone, I don't want anyone to have to deal with my pain if its causing them pain too
I just want to fucking kill myself."
2932,Suicide thoughts,"You guys ever feel like you’re meant to die by suicide? That’s the only way I can imagine my death, like it’s pre written. 

I planned it a bit, no notes but upped life insurance.. to wanted to get a gun but too hard in Aus. 

My worst was a few months ago when I drank too much after some bs, walked in front of traffic and nearly got ran over and bashed for it.. I was in that mind set of idgaf though.. then went and bought a knife coz I was certain I could do it.. the knife was souvenir and blunt as fuck so all it did was leave a semi deep cut that I had to hide under a jumper for a long time.. 

Maybe the knife wasn’t as blunt and I was just too weak to do it.. I feel like i want to die but it’s so hard to do..

Feeling a little better now on meds though but still get those thoughts a lot... 

I should go back to the physiologist but I have a hard time opening up .."
2933,Done,I don’t know why I’m typing this out but I guess I wanna get somethings out before I go the past few years have been hard but this year especially has been the hardest all of the stress from family &amp; friends and me trying to keep my grades up has gotten too much also due to my panic attacks I have been having frequent seizures and it’s just an on going cycle that I’m not ready to complete their are so many other things that are leading me to this decision but I just wanna say I tried and I failed
2934,Failed overdose,I finally pluck up the courage to put an end to my misery and I can’t even get that right. I am not okay. I cannot do this anymore. I can’t keep fighting when there’s nothing left to fight for.
2935,Goodbye,"I am so suicidal, this is it. I am going to write my letters and leave. I cannot live just so other people won’t be sad about me dying. I can’t fucking go on like this. I am in so much pain and it doesn’t get better for me. I have felt this for five fucking years. I have seen the richest of rich and poorest of poor and around the world and none of it is worth living in this painful world. My heart is fucking aching. It is my time to leave. If you knew me, my letters are in the attic in my closet, I love you and I am so sorry you have to deal with this situation now. Goodbye."
2936,Question please answer.,I know i post almost every day and i already asked this question but this will be the last time. I need serious answers. Can tylenol kill me? If so how much can I take so it'll kill me.
2937,You Had A Biblical Name Too,"    Thought we were just friends
    Sitting on bed ends
    You push me to the floor
    After locking the door
    
    And you tell me to shut the fuck up

    Sobbing walking home 
    Did he break a bone 
    No, it's just ""for show""
    Nobody will ever know 
    
    And I guess I deserve it"
2938,Completely failed at living,"I've been suicidal for years. I thought things were getting better recently but I screwed them up. Again. Because I'm incapable of doing even basic stuff.

Now I'm behind on rent, and I'm probably going to fail my courses. I can't talk to my mum about things because I've lied to her about all of it when I still thought I could fix it. I even lie about my situation to people online when they try to help because I'm so embarrassed at how much of a failure I am.

The only thing stopping me is I don't know what to do with my cats. I guess my family could come pick them up but they live quite far away. And, unlike people, I can't explain to my cats why I am leaving."
2939,I want to die,"I’m such a shit. I just hurt everyone. I have called the suicide hotline but they were occupied. I have already took paracetamol, need just a bit more to die. Fuck I’m just a shit. I want to see my friend who killed her self last week again. I’m sorry. I hate my self. I am just a shitty rich kid who deserve to die slowly. I am sorry"
2940,A,"I finally ultimately failed my mom. I finally have no friends, no one trusting to turn to, and no person for comfort. I’ve now dug a deeper hole for myself and fucking up the future I had envisioned. I’m haunted everyday by that. My mom has officially given up on me. She doesn’t believe me.
At this point, my head hurts to talk about what happened but i’m over everything.
I can’t leave because my school is keeping me here and if i leave, i’ll be homeless and jobless with no money and i don’t want that life.
At the same time, i don’t want the life i’m currently living. God i keep running this knife across my arm like i’m not too much of a pussy to break skin
i’m just tired and my head hurts from crying 
I’m just completely and utterly alone in this world, in a home where I’m not wanted anymore.
I think it’s for the best for me to just end it at this point. I feel like there’s no point in trying to progress or do better or fix anything. I can’t do anything.
I just am pissed at myself because i don’t know the best way how. I don’t want to feel pain from stabbing myself or throwing myself off the balcony. I don’t have anything strong enough to hang my fat ass from the ceiling, and I don’t want my little sister to come to my room and see me hanging there.
I’m just tired and I miss my ex I want him really badly because he could always make me feel better but i don’t have him anymore 
so i’m just sitting here looking fucking stupid"
2941,Christmas present,"So my therapist keeps telling me to think about things, that bring me happiness...

The thing is that nothing does, literally nothing.

I just feel like everyone hates me, and i should leave.

So i chose the only thing, that'll make things better for everyone 

If i fail classes, i ctb at 01.01.2020. no excuses"
2942,Am I Depressed if I have thoughts of killing myself,"I don't think I'm depressed. I go out with my friends all the time, im in college, workout and like to party and trip out with the bois. However when I'm by myself I just wonder if it wouldn't just be easier to go jump off a bridge(always wanted to feel the feeling of flight) and find out what happens. Idk it just seems easier than the pressures of acing every class, finding a girl, finding the perfect job and living out the rest of my life. Jumping off a bridge just seems easier than letting everyone I know down, than not being able to live up to everyone's expectations. These thoughts usually pass but I get them quite a bit. I just have these thoughts all the time and it would just be so easy to just free myself from everything in one moment and be free. Just jumping would make everything so much easier"
2943,i was gonna die,around 2 weeks ago i had a fight with my mom she said all thos horrible things to me when i went up stairs to my room i was done living i wanted to die so bad i have lots of meds for my medical condition (asthma ) i took 5 pills of a very strong med and then i started vomit after i started to vomit i panicked then went to bed
2944,"treated like an outcast and garbage but wonders why they don’t sit with us, hm. yeah. i feel the love",
2945,How do parents react to their child's suicide?,"My mind isn't completely made up yet, so just treat everything I'm going to say from now on as an ""If I were to do it"".

I'm severely mentally ill, can't afford therapy, and, frankly, I don't know for how long I can put up anymore. But one thing is stopping me: my family. I never had a great relationship with them, and it's safe to assume they are partially to blame for my condition (especially my father), but still, I feel like making them put up with this is too much. 

I have no doubts they will be devastated, despite our not great relationship, but my question is: to what extent? Will they ever be able to recover and live normal lives, given that they are fairly young?(Late 40s, both of them). And, most importantly, I have a little sister(13 y/o). Would she have the slightest chance at a decent life after this? Maybe I wouldn't mind waiting for a few years until she puts herself on her feet, before I completely ruin this kid's future and create a vicious cycle. 

I'm asking this because I personally don't know anyone to have commited suicide so I can't know in detail how the families usually react."
2946,Dear god,"I fucked up everything 
My grades
My relationships
Everything
My gf left me.
My parents gave up on me.
I thought getting achievements would make me feel. good but it just makes me feel worse.
I tried my best and yet it's never good enough.
I'm too tired for life.
Anything I do will fail and all my hobbies makes me feel like shit.

Do you just hate me god?
Giving me impossible dreams so i fall harder.
Telling me to kill myself.
Showering me with constant thoughts so i can't sleep.
Giving me friends that don't understand me and push me deeper into the void.
People that break my trust and my sanity.
I don't even know if you exist.


I can't take this anymore.
Im too tired.
Let me sleep and never wake up.
Please i can't take this anymore.
The void is getting larger and I'm losing control as the days go.



Sincerely,
Hobosapien"
2947,I’m close to giving up,"Every day is a struggle I wake up crying I go to sleep crying, most of the time I don’t even know why I’m so fucking depressed, I’ve cut myself and have had suicidal thoughts.. I always do. The only thing stopping me from ending it all is my gorgeous girlfriend and family, I wouldn’t want to break their hearts even though I feel like I do everyday. It’s been going on for 4 years now and honestly if I ever lose my girlfriend I don’t think I’ll live much longer she is keeping me alive she’s the only thing I look forward to everyday and sometimes not even she helps me.. I don’t want to die, I just want to end the suffering"
2948,Still want to die,"Last week I broke up with my gf and the guilty was literally killing me... Sunday I finally get to tell her I'm sorry and, I think, make her feel better, tho we aren't talking yet, she needs time...

But still... I need to die. I'm happy I've been capable of tell her I'm sorry for all I did but... it's like... now I can go without resentment, she will be fine without me."
2949,About half a bottle each of vodka and zquil but this is probably just gonna fuck me up and not kill me,
2950,I have been googling and searching the web today the entire day on how to die.,"I'm between jobs, on leave of absence from university due to depression and anxiety, socially withdrawn, mountain of debts of school loans and to top it off, one fine day my bf who was my support told me he don't love me anymore and left me, and confessed that his heart had strayed. This was the man I thought I was going to spend my future with. But left me at my lowest point in life. 

Alcohol and medication doesn't help, sleep gets tiresome, I can feel myself going maniac. I think about my ex every waking minute even though I hate him. I can't visualise my future. I know I'm on borrowed time and this life shouldve ended ages ago.

I want to stop the pain. I don't know how to pick myself up. I'm thinking between hanging or jumping. I wonder if anyone will miss me when I'm gone, or just be glad that I'm not around anymore."
2951,silent,"i'm freaking out in a very large way and if you saw me, you'd never know it because i'm so good at masking my body is cracking. 

i feel ashamed for all the things done to me. i feel ashamed for being alive.

i feel ashamed for being angry. i feel ashamed for caring. i feel ashamed for love.

i feel ashamed to breathe. how can i feel these things and still want to live?

i am living, but it doesn't feel good. it feels like drowning every second of every day.

telling me i'm wrong for these feelings only adds to the shame, so pile more on.

it just makes me feel more ashamed for feeling and even more for sharing.

it gets to the point where my logic overrides my reason and asks what the fuck are you doing?

why are you even here? what's the point of this? you're a fucking idiot for even trying.

i feel shame for feeling shame. i feel shame for hurting. my head starts to chant

i'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorry

the words don't even make sense. they're just a raging storm trying to overwhelm me with horror and guilt and shame and rage and hurt and confusion and why?

i don't know. i don't know why. i didn't ask for any of this, so why do i have to be here? 

i don't want to talk. i can't talk. there's no point. i tried, but the words are never right. they never say what i mean because i don't talk like them. i'm in the wrong fucking world and it hurts and i want to go home please fuck let me come home i'm sorry"
2952,How can I help someone that is suicidal?,"My girlfriend is suicidal and has been for a long time. We are still young (under 20) and her reason for her feelings is because of me and what I have done. I essentially ruined her sense of body image and she feels as though she can never be up to my standards of attractiveness. I can go into details but they are probably irrelevant. She is strongly opposed to therapy and seeing a doctor, leaving me unsure of what I should do. 

Please provide me with some advice because I am at a loss; I just want her to be happy and healthy."
2953,"Took a Norco, drank a bunch and smoked a bunch of weed. I don’t think it’s enough",
2954,Anyone willing to talk to me?,"I'm really depressed right now, and I feel lonely. Anyone willing to talk to me?"
2955,Detergent,Can someone help me quit
2956,keep suicide at bay,"i am 23 years old and live with my girlfriend which i am very grateful to live with. shes leaving next week to visit her family out of state. these thoughts have been here with me since ive been a teen

i want to stay here, but these thoughts, they stay with me. i need reasons to stay, shes gone for a month

i dont have money to seek help, i need books, guidance, insight"
2957,It’s 512 am. I can’t sleep and am just deep in my anxiety.,"My suicidal ideation isn’t really ever actionable, and I don’t feel that way right now. 

I’ve been a server in a restaurant for a few years- and have began bartending the last few months. Additionally, this is my first semester back in college in multiple years. I closed bar, got home at 230 and am seriously unable to sleep. I ran out of my anxiety prescription last week and have ordered a refill, but the cost is stressful. That cost in addition to my tuition costs and health insurance has the livable wage I was earning in the service industry stretching a lot less than it used to. I think I’m gonna bite the bullet and just pay for it. 

I also have a final in 4 hours and need to sleep. University has been significantly more demanding than I expected, and I feel far less intelligent than I did during adolescence. 

I know this is all rambling and nonsense but I don’t have anyone awake I can vent to, so thanks for reading this."
2958,I’m gonna delete this post in a minute,"It’s scheduled for New Years. I fucked up high school basically either stumbled my way into class or came in late due to my hungover dumbass self. Honestly didn’t even party THAT much just fucking hated having to come home and sit in my room alone. I’ve lurked r/raisedbynarcissists probably since the beginning of high school to cope with my parents putting me and my brother in the middle of their shit. About two years ago I was using drugs like lsd and mdma. I live in a city where laced drugs is a very bad problem and ended up having fentanyl in my weed. I was clinically dead for two minute, idk I remember hearing that but I remember the whole, I remember waking up and not having my mother or brother in the hospital, despite the excuses it still hurt. I remember seeing my mothers face turn red and devilish; idk I was pretty drugged out the whole time, I  was on lsd that might as well so you could imagine how traumatizing that’d be and not have anybody to talk too, my parents eventually sent me to therapy but that lasted like 3 whole days then she left, honestly such a bullshit line of work tbh. Fast forward to now I don’t even know right now what the fuck I’m doing I’ve lost literally all direction in my life. I have one friend I really cared about after I moved school to go to some fucking alt program for less than average kids, it’s obvious, they don’t tell you but lol. At this point i am 16 turning 17 in January, I live with my father who I’m pretty sure is a gaslighting narcissist but I don’t I might be the narc who fucking cares right. Anyways I’m pretty sure there’s gotta be some limit to how many words I can post so. Games over y’all pce out."
2959,I felt the gun against my head and realized I wasn’t afraid anymore., I think it’s time. I’m a burden. There always seems to be all these problems surrounding me and I’m realizing they must be my fault. I’m causing trouble for people at work. My husband is unhappy. My parents are stuck constantly worrying or trying to help and all I do is continue to fuck up and make things worse. I just want everyone to be happy and I have to be the source of the unhappiness. 18 years of feeling suicidal and I’ve had enough. Can’t I just stop suffering? Hasn’t this cage of a body had enough? I’m trapped here in a world that hurts. It hurts to be here. It hurts it hurts it hurts.
2960,I want to kill myself tonight,"The one connection that meant something to me is lost. I have no birth/bio family. I'm completely alone in a dark world, and breaking apart by the day. I turned 30 - alone in a boarding house. 

My roommates are horrible to me, and the dreams I've had since a child are not going to come true, and it makes me want to pass out. I constantly cry. I was sectioned and handcuffed by the police and thrown into a psych ward three months ago. 

I've been homeless, living in poverty. Cast away from every good thing. I've never had a relationship with anyone. 

I'm not even human. I will die to because I never had the chance to become human. My soul is exhausted. 

I'm tried. Deep in my bones I'm tired. I just can't wake up anymore. 

My last true hope is gone. And it's killing me."
2961,Probably NOT going to kill myself.,"Let's be real, if I haven't done it by now, it's not happening any time soon. But then why the FUCK can't my mind realize that IF I'M NOT KILLING MYSELF, I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND DOING NOTHING.

I am neglecting my obligations, shirking my responsibilities, as if they don't matter any more. But I'm still kicking. I have to face the realities of that negligence the next morning. I'm only making it harder to go on. It's the most extreme, extreme, extreme fucking case of procrastination you've ever seen. I'm just straight up. Not. Doing anything.

It's purgatory. I haven't chosen to live, but life doesn't wait for that certainty. I WISH I was dead. But I'm not. And in the meantime I am fucking up any chance of WANTING to live.

And the worst part is, I've been exactly here before. I stopped functioning, I went to therapy, I got better. But I'm back where I started, a year later. I can't keep fucking doing this, but I'm probably NOT going to kill myself. So what. Do. I do."
2962,what’s a quick and painless way to go?,"i’m 14 so please be logical about what i can get my hands on, but please don’t try to talk me out of this i just want to stop living

thank you"
2963,I wish it could stop,"I’ve been crying for 3 hours and shaking and don’t know why. No drug or anything will stop my tears or depression. I went through some drug withdrawals and back and on. I’m out of breath and reason trying to control my emotions. I’m just done with this I feel sometimes. I told a parent I’m gonna hang myself at 40 if shit is still like this. That’s a horrible thing to say, but I think sometimes it will be much sooner. I’m on the fucking edge with emotions. I wish someone understood or would just hug me or just anything at all. 

Thanks for reading. I can’t even type anymore. I just had to reach out to something right now"
2964,What are my options?,"I hate myself. I hate my life. I love my family and close friends. I literally hate every aspect of myself. I’m a fuck up. I am failing at every thing in my life. EVERYTHING. Not one thing is going good. Not even ok. This is super vague, but I could write a book on reasons why I hate myself.  Oh and no one knows what I’m going through. Like at all. I fake smile everyday and pretend everything is ok. I don’t know what depression is or how one is diagnosed, but yeah maybe. I don’t know. 

I would never commit suicide, I wouldn’t be able to do that to my family. Like that’s not even a thing.

So what should I do? I’ve given myself the “I’m turning my life around starting now” talks WAY to many time. What do I actually do? 

I reached out to a therapist once, but I have no insurance and they pretty much hit me with a “damn that sucks, see ya.” I am broke and can’t afford a therapist. 

I sound like a broken cd but.. What do I do?? What are my options? You guys aren’t therapists I get that, I don’t even know why I’m posting this here. But maybe someone has went through something similar. Or not. I guess I just want someone to read this. There’s nothing personal here of what I’m actually going through. But if someone read this. You now know more about me than ANYONE of my friends and family. That’s crazy. Anyways, yeah. Bye."
2965,I don’t want to do this any longer,"It does not ‘get better’. I am 50 years old. It’s been like this for 35 years. There is no treatment that works. Whatever it is, I’ve tried it. Numerous times. 

I feel like I am expected to continue living to mollify society. But the truth is, if anyone kept an animal in suffering this long, they’d be prosecuted, and the animal put out of it’s misery. 

I don’t want to do this any more."
2966,Does anyone else just not know what the fuck to do to improve their situation?,"I know what needs to happen, I need a better, stable job that pays well, but I can't find one that wouldn't be so boring and mindless where it wouldn't make me blow my brains out within a few years.

I need more stable housing, but that requires a good job. 

I have more needs to be truly happy but they're a bit longer term.

I know it looks like I just have to work my way up, find a job that's all right and keep working at it until I have some money for things. But I've already tried that several times and it's just not working out. So I really don't know what to do.

Do I drop all my money in some nice tools and go fucking build a log cabin somewhere and live in total isolation forever so I don't have to worry about a job or any of that modern bullshit ever again? Do I go on a coke binge in the Caribbean or South America and go out with a bang? Do I sit down and plan out a bank robbery to see if I could pull it off? I don't fucking know. And it sucks."
2967,I've given up,"My life to this point has been quite complex, to name just one, my mother suffers from Borderline and Narcissistic PD, and i have had her abusing me my entire life. 2 years ago, i stopped seeing her (she committed sexual assault and apparently that's the only abuse that matters to police). 

I have had resources to kill myself in a specified  place for over 5 years, and about 5 weeks ago I told my dad about my plans. Everyone thinks i was looking for help, when in reality I was informing the few people who gave a shit about me that it wasn't their fault. I have taken mirtazapine for almost three weeks but i can't do it anymore. The main thing that's stopped me in the past is the effect it would have on my dad, but i don't care anymore. I'm in so much pain my life will end in suicide regardless. I know the people refusing to leave me by myself are trying to help, but i just wish they'd fuck off so i can end the pain i'v felt all my life.

If any of those people ever read this, i'm sorry for what i had to do, I'm too weak to go on any more"
2968,I thought things would get better.,"
TL;DR After all the positive things that have happened in my life and the good friends and family I have, I have no desire to live.



Recently I had a lot of postive things happen in my life: I got over my social anxiety, I got better at making friends and now I have a girlfriend.  On top of that I grew up in a well off family and I have not had many financial problems and yet nothing has changed! Deep with inside me lingers the thought of suicide. I still to this day have no desire to live despite positive things happening in my life. No matter what medication I take, no matter what therapist I see, no matter my financial situation, no matter the loving people I have in my life, I just can't seem to find a will to live."
2969,I've never felt so alone,"I have a loving family and good friends, and I hate the feeling that I'm keeping a secret from them.

My friends and family know that I am suicidal, and are generally aware that it's a ""when not if"" kind of situation. They are very sad about it of course but also have shown a great deal of understanding and have accepted that it is ultimately my decision to make. I am very appreciative of this.

I'm struggling at the moment with how alone I feel as I plan my departure. Obviously I can't tell people when or how or where, because they would instinctively want to prevent it. I'm spending a lot of time tying up loose ends - I've informed my job that I will be leaving, taken all of my money out of the bank (to avoid my family having the stress of trying to access it after I'm gone), begun giving my possessions away, etc. It's just so hard doing all this in secret. If I were dying of a terminal illness, I could share my last days with my family, everyone could prepare for it and we could say proper goodbyes. In this circumstance, it all has to be private, and I won't die surrounded by friends and family, I will be alone and away from home.

It feels so unfair, that it has to be this way. It's eating me up inside constantly."
2970,I can't stop the image of my family crying,"I've been wanting to die for weeks now, but when I'm about to think about how to do it, the image of my family crying, not knowing what to do, disappointed passes through my mind. This prevents me from taking another step to die"
2971,I just found out my mom sleeps in my childhood bed and cries herself to sleep every night because of me and my suicidal threats. Now I'm trapped on earth in this guilty hell.,"Background: I'm 25 F. I'm too old to be doing this. I had a lot of anger towards my family until this year. They were the voice of anxiety for me and held me back immeasurably as a child. They refused to get me help for my very clinical, very obvious mental illnesses as a kid (not just depression, stuff that needed medical intervention) and were quite homophobic while I was secretly a lesbian the entire time. I couldn't forgive them for this until this very year when we talked it all out. I still can't tell my dad about the lesbian thing or he will disown me. Today I still struggle with the thoughts that he will never be at my wedding if I ever live that long.

When I was 19 I suffered heart failure in their home because I was severely anorexic and wanted to let myself die. I ended up surviving it but was thoroughly traumatized and my brain/body quite frankly did not recover from being anorexic for 2.5 years. My lowest was 67 lbs and I didn't get my period for 4 years after. I forgot memories, lost bone mass, my jaw is permanently damaged and locks from the binge eating/chewing.

So, I was irrationally angry and screaming all the time, had to constantly have my heart looked at, developed health anxiety and lost my early 20s to it. All the while, felt horribly guilty for the way I was treating my parents, who looking back as a 25 year old, were probably just really scared and upset with me and would do anything to help.

But my mental illness made me ungrateful for my life to begin with, and their will to force me alive caused me to resent them. I had been asking to die for so long. I have consulted anorexic support groups and it is just like being a drug addict. If someone tries to help you, you snap at them, which is what my parents were probably doing, but I had my reasons... I became anorexic because my father used to call me a fat d\*ke all the time, and I didn't feel too bad screaming at him. But my mother, I felt bad.

I moved out as soon as I turned 21 and finished college, then never really went home again. I didn't make any friends and lived 4000K miles from them, so I slowly started to unravel and lose touch with reality, disassociating for weeks on end. I had to start seeing a psych and a therapist who diagnosed me with PTSD and clinical OCD, as well as major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. All of this my parents ignored and said I made up.

I started to get suicidal. Really, really suicidal. I attempted 2x. When I told my parents, they started acting different. Kissing my ass. I think my 21 year old self liked it. Here was the love I didn't get as a child.

I have no friends. I told them all when I was 21 that I had been anorexic in college/attempted suicide before, and they all got really scared of me. They remained friends with me just for the chance that I become successful because I've had some luck in my industry. But I can't talk to them about emotional stuff, they will just shut me down, I tried before.

This feeling of complete loneliness is the reason I started calling my mom for reassurance (an OCD thing) or during a manic suicidal episode every other week for the past 4 years I've lived here.

I literally have made no progress, with therapy and meds, I am literally so deeply alone and suicidal after 4 years living alone with no close friends. I don't sleep, I ruined my health, I have super bad bags under my eyes and look like I aged a hundred years. People went from thinking I looked 20 to 35 these past 4 years.

I called my mom today and realized she has been so worried about me these past 4 years because of me calling/texting her saying i wanna kill myself, getting frustrated when she refuses to understand my logic in killing myself, then saying horrible things to her like I hate her, I wouldn't be crazy if she didn't marry my dad who has these 2 mental illnesses, I wish she never brought me into this world, she did this to me, etc... that she hasn't slept more than 4-6 hours a night the entire time. She sleeps in my bedroom and holds my stuffed animal from when I was a kid, and now she has a bunch of health problems from not sleeping that she won't disclose to me. I'm worried she had a stroke or something. I tried to call my sister but my sister won't disclose it either.

Maybe I did all of this so I would have a real reason to kill myself. I don't know. I truly think I deserve it now. I hurt my mother because I was immature and desperate and alone. I treated her like my therapist and on call emotional support because I couldn't find either of those things for a really long time, still probably haven't. I call or text her every day because I'm so fucking alone. I have acquaintances and friends and a promising career but I can't connect with people. They get afraid of me because all i do is talk about suicide. its all i think about. it's been my end goal this whole time. i sabotaged my youth, hurt my mother, i'm literally the devil incarnate. i deserve to be dead."
2972,I can't stop imagining my family crying,"I've been wanting to die for weeks now, but when I'm about to think about how to do it, the image of my family crying, not knowing what to do, disappointed passes through my mind. This prevents me from taking another step to die"
2973,Maybe i'll try this night. To end it all. I can't anymore,
2974,Advice on a lethal cocktail.,"So I'm killing myself tomorrow and I will be consuming 2 boxes of Dimetapp, some whiskey, and a box of citalopram I just want to know what ill be expecting from anyone with any knowledge of pharmaceuticals or lethal dosages things like that thanks."
2976,If medicine doesn't work,I'm bipolar and just recently turned 26.. I haven't been medicated since I was a teenager. The medications were always so awful from my memory. But lately I just can't stay level and I'm losing everyone around me.. so I'm very seriously considering medication.. but god if this doesn't even help.. I think I have to die.. I'm so tired of watching my phone ring and not be able to pick it up.. if I can't stop hurting people I don't deserve to be here.
2977,To Just Be Gone,"It would truly be blissful, to be free from my body and my life and gone away. I have to be someone I never wanted to be to adapt to the world and I'm just filled with discontent. I can't feel sad anymore, I am just empty and then I react with anger at anything that goes wrong at all. I only cope with music being my hobby and smoking pot to escape from things but it only does so much.

I had an experience with drugs where I passed out. I went cold and everything faded away, for a few minutes I was completely gone away from my body and life. Nothing existed anymore and it was nothing short of liberating. I just wish that never ended. I'm nervous of dying but it isn't as scary after that happened. Someday soon I'll be free of everything."
2978,countdown to 12.12.,"so apparently the full moon occurs at 12:12 on 12/12. i've always heard that repeating numbers have some significance, so if shit don't get better for me, (unemployed convicted felon facing homelessness to start 2020, just lost my job last monday, 12/2 , real bummer ) real soon, then i figure, fuck it, thats about as good as  time as any to go see the wizard eh ? wish me luck!  hopefully shit starts to turn"
2979,no one even fucking cares,"I try joining as many online communities as I can, some of them with the intend to get help from, mostly on discord. All that ends up happening is getting called a faggot and a tranny and then kicked out. Maybe its better if I die, no one gives a fuck"
2980,: ( mixed thoughts,"Hi everyone. Hope y'all are having a good day.

I'm mixed between not wanting to be here anymore and wanting to go after my dreams. 
I feel like if I ... Died in my sleep maybe it would be easier. I can't even think properly right now. 

✌️"
2981,How much time does it take to die by drinking detergent,
2982,Quick “diary” by someone who might have depression.,"I don’t really expect people to even ready this, but here is my quick “diary” of what happened today. 

It’s 4:54pm rn I’m in cafeteria in college and I’m having my first semi panick attack I think. I’m a fuck up. I hate my life, even though I have it a lot better than a lot of people, I’m just a fuck up. I singlehandedly fucked up my life and I think this is the point where I can actually see myself in the future being a nobody. Having a job as a college drop out, no one around me, no friends and family because of my wrongdoings. I don’t EVER cry because I don’t think I’m physically capable of doing so. I’ve felt like absolute shit before but tears just can’t come out. I’m sitting here in a table with my eyes starting to water up but now I don’t want to let them out. The reason why I’m having this panic attack is because I missed the final exam to my only important class this semester. I am taking only two classes.. because I’m a fucking idiot and that’s the only classes I can take since I’ve failed all my prerequisites to get into my major courses. I can pass my bullshit class this semester, but this important class (math) I’m failing hard because I’m a depressed piece of shit that has missed class for over a month. I literally only have two classes and I’m failing this. WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with me. I hate myself so much. I haven’t even studied for the final exam (which I’ve missed). I thought it was going to be on Wednesday morning and I was going to cram tf out of it and go take the exam, even if I’m failing anyways. But no. I’m here typing this stupid note for no reason. I called my professor three times but obviously he’s not in his office so he didn’t pick up. I am going to email him right now. I am fucked obviously though. Oh and I’m on adderall because I thought today I was going to study my ass off for this exam. I am also high and have a Xanax in my backpack for later tonight when I go to bed. When I say that I’m a fuck up. I mean I’m a FUCK UP. My friends and family don’t know ANYTHING and I’m pretty sure after I’m kicked out of college this semester, they will have to find out (obviously) and I will probably rather die than wait for that to happen. I know I should have told them since the beginning. Fuck that. I should have never put myself in this situation. My parents have always given my all the support in the world with everything and I literally have the best parents in the world. I love my family and I love my close friends. But no one knows what I’m going through. I’ve had so many opportunities to change and better myself but I always seem to throw it all away. I hate myself so much. I don’t know what depression is, I don’t know if I have it or if I’m just a fuck up. This will 100% blow up in my face soon. I’m so afraid for that. It has to though. The best thing and only thing I should do is tell my parents about this myself. But I can’t. Imagine how heartbroken they will be. That would be the worst let-down in history. I can’t do that to them. I would NEVER EVER even consider killing myself. NEVER. But if I died for some reason. I wouldn’t mind. That’s so hard to say (or type) and even though I don’t actually wish for that to ever happen to me. It wouldn’t suck. The only reason why spontaneously dying would suck is because I wouldn’t want my family to suffer like that. I love them so much. All of them. So much. So I would never hurt myself. I think I’m too much of a pussy for that anyways. And I would hate to just randomly die because of the pain I’d inflict on others. But that wouldn’t suck. For me. I think it’s the only way I’d be happy. Or not really “happy.” But just the only way I can finally not feel ANYTHING. I tried Xanax for the first time last night and smoke a little on my pen. I love smoking weed because it makes me forget everything (sometimes) and I can just watch a comedy movie and laugh. Just block out the world and laugh to a movie or whatever. Well Xanax. That was something else. I laid in bed and just floated on earth. As I typed that I realize how stupid and ridiculous that sounds and when I read this thing again I’ll probably realize again how that doesn’t even make sense. But as of now, that’s how I’m going to describe it. I floated on earth. My bedroom lights were off and I laid in bed under my blanket and I literally floated on earth. There was not one thing on my mind. It was meditating. My mind and body were blank. It was like my eyeballs were just floating in darkness and I can only see my dark room (with the tv on playing 21 jump street) so yeah the movie was playing and I was getting sleepy. Next thing I knew (from what I can remember right now) I was turning off an alarm set at 8:30am. I wasn’t sitting how I was when I was watching the movie. I was laying in my bed how I normally sleep. The Xbox and TV were off. I can’t remember what happened really. I guess it’s a thing. People usually black out and forget what happened. I took a very small dosage though so I wasn’t expecting that to happen. Anyway, I don’t know how I got so sidetracked with what’s going on. But yeah my entire life is fucked. It’s even crazier to think about the fact that this is not the worse it’s gunna be. I still have to “find out” I’m kicked out of school. And I still have to tell my parents everything. Maybe not the drug stuff but just that their son is a failure. So yeah. I guess I’m not really panicky anymore and I feel a bit more calm now. As I typed that my heart rate started going up and feel like I might pass out again. Anyway, this is my life as of today. It is actually 5:25 pm now. Lmao I’m embarrassing. Why having I emailed my professor yet? My friend is here in the college library (I’m in the cafeteria) because I had told him earlier today that we should study together. So now I’m about to head over there and pretend like I’m happy and okay and as if nothing is happening. As if I don’t actually hate myself in every aspect. I am literally failing in every aspect of my life. That’s fucking crazy. And it’s really all on me. It’s my fault I’m a fucking loser. Anyways I’ve been doing this for a while now. I’m going to go pee and then with my friend to study my math final that I already missed. Maybe my next “diary note” will be from me in the streets. If I make it that far. That’s a joke and all but yeah bye.

Just real quick. I want to point out the fact that I knew this was going to happen. Last year or even before that I knew that if I kept being the way I was being, I would be in this position. But yet, I continued. It’s almost like I asked for this. Like I wanted this. Why didn’t I stop myself? I don’t know. Whatever. It’s too late now to start giving a shit about my life anymore. But I obviously do. Bye.

Sorry it’s so long. I didn’t realize how long it was until I stopped typing. I don’t know why I posted this on here. I just did. So yeah. Ask any questions or just remind me how stupid I am if you want. The list of how much I hate myself could go on forever."
2983,I just want to stop hurting,"I've pushed everyone away. I live on a couch that's not my own. I'm 34 and I have no direction in life nor any desire for it.

I know how I'm going to do it and the best time to do it, I just have to choose who finds me. I definitely won't put that on my daughter, I'll make sure she's not here.

This is the farthest I've gotten into planning.

Every moment is pain. I'm all alone in it.

And it's all my fault."
2984,Laying in bed with the Ativan bottle next to me.... I’m ready to go.,All I’m good for is a ride or someone to use. I want to sleep and never wake up. Bye bitches
2985,feel so overwhelmed with really intense heartbreaking guilt because i have fully come to terms with the fact that i will be killing myself within a couple months,i can come up with a plethora of reasons behind why i should kill myself and 0 reasons behind why i shouldn’t. my life is constantly terrible and it’s inconvenience after inconvenience and idk how to be happy because i’ve never been happy before. this world is so terrible to me and i too am terrible to others because of it.  and the only way out is dying. god hates me and he has no plans for me other than my cowardly end. good things seem to happen to everyone but me. i am so lonely. i have never experienced even the smallest positive things unlike everyone else and i never will. all i know is that if i don’t kill myself soon i will enventually end up doing it in the future as an adult. that’s just how things were made for me. nobody is able to come up with any reasons that me doing so is a bad idea bc they simply don’t exist!! some of us are just worthless and have no use.
2986,im fucking terrified for christmas break,"i dont think i can trust myself to be alone for that long

im getting so damn close to killing myself, the only thing i live for is the people around me so they dont have to deal with my death

i honestly dont know what the fuck i should do, i have so little control left"
2987,Life kind of crumbled apart tonight. Felt really bad for a long time. Having very dark thoughts.,"Tonight has been very very hard on me.

For context, my life is not a super luxurious one. I (21MTF) live with two roommates, one of which is my girlfriend(19F) of a year and a half. 

I work as a Starbucks barista, which is a fancy way of saying I get abused on the daily and have no self worth. My girlfriend also works there. She's technically responsible for me because I was hired due to her. It's a long story. I kind of suck at my job. I'm really distractable and generally kind of a shit worker. My coworkers like me as a person but hate me as a coworker. My girlfriend brought this all to light to me tonight and basically dropped the bombshell that people don't like working with me. It was really hard for me to come to grips with.

She also brought up that I don't help around the apartment. And she's right. I don't. I'm a lazy dumbass. She kind of grilled me about that and found a way to remedy the situation. I can't say I blame her for doing what she did. I needed my ass kicked on that front a bit. That doesn't mean I took it well. It still hurt to hear even though I know I live in a den of my own sloth.

And then she dropped one last bombshell on me. I told her I needed her help to get motivated. I needed to feel like I was more loved than I felt at that point in time. She and I have been kind of distant lately and I haven't been feeling the love. My motivation kind of tanked as a result. But that's not her fault. She told me, in a fit of rage, that due to her dad physically abusing her when she was young, that she absolutely hated being touched. Like no hugs, nothing.

I was devastated. I didn't know I had made her feel bad. She suffered because of my actions and never said a word to me. I felt fucking horrendous that I'd done that to her. She doesn't respond to my primary source of showing love and I have no idea what to do. She broke down and said she's sorry she's not normal and asked me if I wanted to break up over it.

I don't know what to do. My first thought was to wait for her to go to sleep and cut my wrists. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. My girlfriend is the love of my life and I don't want to be with anyone else. But maybe I'm not what she needs. I feel like I'm falling into a bottomless pit. I want off the ride. I don't want to do this anymore."
2988,Have you ever wondered how long would it take for people to notice you were gone?,"I often imagine myself drifting my car and falling off a cliff while driving by myself on a high speed road. I wonder how long would it take for people to notice I suddenly disappeared. Nobody truly cares about me as nobody ever text me to genuinely know how I’m doing. Only person that does that every now and then it’s my dad and I’m lucky I still got him around, cuz once he’s gone idk what I’m gonna do with my life. I’m single. I’m not dating anyone and I do believe there is no one out there who loves me. I wonder who would look for me if I disappeared. Who would really care about my death. What would they say at my funeral (if I do get one). I just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up."
2989,if reincarnation ever gets proven conclusively I'm ending my life in a heartbeat,"every aspect of my life is complete and utter shit, my reputation is completely ruined due to a combination of outside events and one dumb drunk mistake I made (nothing illegal, just an utterly, completely stupid, completely avoidable misunderstanding), I've never been in a relationship and my chances of ever being in one are zip, my family life is so bad I have to be on guard 24/7 even at home and constantly be on the lookout for erratic changes in behavior, I have zero chances to move up in life for the next 5 years at least and I'll either be in massive debt or at the very least completely broke when it happens and the only person I've ever had in my life who's told me they'd always be there for me currently wants nothing to do with me, I don't have the energy to deal with people anymore so I pretty much just go to work and either get plastered by myself or go straight home and sit in a dark room watching low maintenance tv shows, at this point the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't know what's on the other side and death just seems equally as worthless as my life (I just don't have the energy to put in the effort it would take to kill myself), but if I find out there's a chance to do it all over again in another time or place I'm out, I've cocked it all up and I'm just waiting for conclusive proof of some type of afterlife at this point"
2990,Smoking Cigarettes for a Slow Suicide,I’ve been on and off cigarettes for years now and I’m only 20. I used to smoke them because I had an addiction... but now I smoke because each cigarette brings me that much closer to dying and thinking about it that way kind of relieves me
2991,Ruined my life and failed at kill myself.,"I have a depression very strong. I don't know what to do because i don't want to go to terapy, i just want all of this to end.
I have/had a drug adiction (I say had because i'm trying to don't do it anymore), and EDS. I started to sniffing coke because it helped me to not feel hunger... I lost a LOT of weith. Eventually I had a overdose... But i can't stop doing coke because feel hungry made me very sad, and still on it.

Yesterday morning i left my partner because i think (and i know) that i'm a constant danger to myself and I don't want that to keep hurting him.
Hours later i had an attack of anxiety very strong, he came with me, i don't want to do this so much longer so i'm gonna resume a little... Yesterday everything was traumatic for me.
My partner said me that he don't want to see me again and blocked me, so why the fucking fuck he came when i left him and i had a anxiety attack?

I sleep a few hours and woke up with all my family in my house (I live with my dad only) saying that what i done to myself was too far and called the police. I runed away.


I don't want to spend holidays in a mental hospital, even knowing how bad i am.
I just want to end my life. I think yesterday is a day full of memories that remembering them will make me cry for a long time.

and I also feel that despite having left my partner and that he has come to take care of me and then disappear definitively, it makes me feel really abandoned at the worst moment of my life. He literally came for a while and left, and now I need so much that he hugs me but I understand and respect that he doesn't want to be a caretaker of a mentally ill person.


I'm sorry for my english, i'm from argentina and don't know so much this languaje."
2992,I’m really scared about Christmas break.,"I’m currently a freshman in college and Christmas break is in two weeks. Ever since I left high school, my depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse. I was very close to dying over summer break, going so far as to put a gun in my mouth. I thought heavily about suicide over Thanksgiving break and now I’m scared about what I might do over Christmas. The main reason is because I feel so alone even though I have a great group of friends who constantly support me. I’ve recently started going to therapy and I’m taking meds for the first time in my life. None of these things seem to be helping as the thoughts are still constantly there.

My grades in college have taken a hit because of this as well. I’m currently failing two of my classes and I feel like the biggest idiot as a result. I have also made no new friends here because I stay in my room depressed all day. I see how well both socially and academically my high school friends are doing and it makes me hate myself everyday.

The suicidal thoughts seem to multiply whenever I return home. This is probably because I have easier access and privacy if I wanted to do so. I have already told one of my friends that I would call him if the thoughts got too serious, but I’m worried that I won’t be able to do that. It’s going to suck spending another Christmas with a lonely feeling in my heart. I’m hoping I make it through the weeks ok and I hope whoever is reading this also has a safe Christmas."
2993,Probably going to end it soon.,"Not sure how I want to. Probably not violently, I want my family to be able to see me one last time. Just feels like nothing will ever get better. Even if it could I don't want it to. I just wanna overdose and die. I don't want help. Or maybe I do thats why I'm writing this, maybe I just want to see that thing that will save my life. But who knows I'm lost. I won't be around much longer. Hitting up my drug dealer tomorrow gonna try my luck. Might just empty my savings into his pocket"
2994,My life is in shambles and it’s all my fault,"I just told my girlfriend I slept with another woman (spare me the PoS comments, I am already torturing myself enough). She told me she wants to be alone. I really wanna do it. I want to save her the pain of dealing with what a piece of shit I am. I don’t think I can survive without her."
2995,Hard Week,I have several chronic issues that cause extreme pain. Having a hard time dealing this week. Feels like being tortured but I feel like an idiot for not just being okay with it.
2996,Every day feels like a nightmare,"I don't even know where to start honestly. I just feel like every day is a nightmare that I can't keep trying to shake myself awake from... but it turns out, I'm actually awake.

It's only been four months since I was diagnosed with Bipolar II. The diagnosis was a real shock to me, though looking back, I've been exhibiting the symptoms of it since I was around 12 years old... almost 10 years ago now (I will be 22 in two months) but it was previously misdiagnosed as major depression when I was 16 and tried to kill myself.. I was depressed, anxious, self-harming, the whole nine yards. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when finally, after months of searching, I found a psychiatrist to go to and she diagnosed me. But she turned out to be a total b*tch (after she initially diagnosed me, she decided to take her sweet time prescribing medicine even after pestering her for a week for SOMETHING because of feeling suicidal and wanting the cycling to stop at least a little) and so I stopped seeing her. She didn't even contact me to see why I missed the next appt. I could have been dead. Whatever, I guess.

Anyway, yeah I had a mental breakdown later on that month. It was really bad, I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't stop crying, I just felt dead inside... and one night, I decided I just couldn't take it anymore. So the next morning, I packed my crap into a bag and my mother took me to check myself into the psychiatric hospital. It was my second time being in one; the previous time, as I mentioned before, was when I was 16 and had OD'd on pain meds. Obviously, that didn't work, but I didn't want it to get to that point again because I have access to definitive ""methods"" now vs. then.

I spent a week in the hospital. I enjoyed the time away, met some amazing people I'll never forget... but when I got out, nothing really changed. All the triggers were worse. My family is one of my big triggers and my parents came to visit me everyday, which I appreciated to some extent, but on my last night there, my dad made a point to barrage me with questions about 'What am I gonna do different' 'You need a plan, you need a schedule' 'You need to go to church more' etc. etc... that basically triggered a sense of anxiety that hasn't really let up to this very day. Honestly, ever since I was released, thanks to my family, I feel like things are worse than before. It stinks.

The worst part about it is there is a SIGNIFICANT shortage of mental health professionals where I live (which is why it took me so long to find that crappy psych I saw before). There aren't a lot of psychologists/psychiatrists/therapists and the ones there ARE, they are all booked up for months and months. It is impossible to find someone, short of going to the psych hospital and having them set you up with someone for outpatient. So I went to the outpatient place they DID set me up with. That place was just as awful and it wasn't even an actual psychiatrist; it was a nurse practitioner who looked at the questionnaire and my long list of medications from the hospital, said 'Let's stop some of these' and then sent me on my way. Didn't ask about me, my history or anything like that. If you couldn't tell, switching around and stopping medications didn't help anything all, if anything it has made the cycling and the episodes worse.

So I'm struggling to find someone... AGAIN. I have medicine that doesn't work. My family finds new ways to make me feel more awful about myself everyday. I'm struggling to lose weight. I'm drinking slightly too much (which doesn't help the weight). All of my so-called ""friends"" don't want anything to do with me. I don't have a lover. I am just really, really lonely. I've tried plenty of times IRL and online (even on this site) to make friends but even that hasn't worked. And when I try to open up about my problems to people, they just dismiss it or tell me 'Get help' when I have exhausted everything... I have tried the meager resources around here, I have been in the hospital, nothing is helping.

Speaking of ""friends...""

I am (or was, at this point) part of this fandom that's predominantly made up of younger people... predominantly *immature* younger people. (Just look at my post history, you'll see what fandom it is) I've been dealing with some bullying on a different website with people from said fandom. It is hard to deal with, seeing that these are kids younger than me and it just baffles me how... vicious they are.

About two weeks ago, I had met this girl on said website, younger than me (17), but I thought we vibed well because 1. We are in the same fandom and 2. She ""claims"" to be bipolar as well, and she originally reached out to me to rant about how unhappy she was after a long-term relationship breakup and the things her ex said about her. So I was more of a support she came to that turned into a friendship, if you want to call it that.

Naturally, since I thought we were getting on well, I decided to start opening up a little about what's been going on lately (big mistake) and her reaction triggers a big depressive episode for me in the process. I talk about it, I mention how hopeless I am feeling yet again and how it scares me after what I went through in August. And she comes COMPLETELY out of left field with this self help, positive, be your best you BS.

Here are some nice quotes for context:

""Personal changes can be made if you feel a certain way. Don't like something? Change it. Don't like where you're at in life? Change it. Us as humans we are in control of our lives but sometimes are blinded by the fears of failing or the emotion of hopelessness. But in reality, we are in charge and can do anything with our lives. As long as the change is positive, you will be just fine. Just don't make it worse. Training yourself to be kind to yourself takes work but it's so worth it in the end.""

""We always get the bad before the good. And as the years go on, you will learn, cope better, and become stronger.""

So when I called her out on her BS for her telling me she is always happy and how she 'loves herself so, so, so much' when just days earlier, she had just told me how unhappy she was with herself and how, in her own words, not mine, 'she doesn't feel real sometimes and is scared she will hurt herself or someone else'... her response was:

""I make sure I'm a good person, I stay healthy, and that my life will be filled with love. Others focus on self hatred, violence, etc. but once you start working on yourself, you will love who you become and who you sculpt yourself out to be. Like before, we are in control. It's your choice to make it good or bad. And I always choose good. I value so much in my life and in this world.""

Was I wrong for being offended at all this? I get the intent (somewhat) was nice, but why say that to someone who is telling you that they're horribly depressed and want to die? And how can you say that you hate yourself, are scared of yourself, you struggle with bipolar disorder but then on the other side of the token, say that you love yourself and basically if you are unhappy, you are intentionally choosing to be unhappy? How can you say that you're such an amazing person but then say that your ex told you that you were manipulative but then on the same hand, it was ALL the other person's fault?

I don't know. I told her straight up that hearing that in my condition isn't very helpful. She got mad and then started giving me one word answers. Finally, it blew up and she told me I need to 'Get help' and 'You have issues, I can't help you but I'll be there for you' but then proceeds to ditch me when I was actively feeling suicidal. When I confronted her about it the next day, she told me to just drop it or stop talking. I confronted her about something else hypocritical she said and so I decided to block her on the website. She FREAKED OUT, so I unblocked her and tried to save face.

Yesterday I got fed up with it all, told her I was gonna go and do something, I'll talk to her later, and just never messaged her back. Lmao. She can have her own little meltdown if she wants to, she claims she has SO many friends (after like 2 people, including me, started talking to her, and one is a 13-year-old that she claims as ""hers"" so take that creepy statement as you will) and is SO wise and SO wonderful (even though she is 17 and has lived/done so much) so I really don't need to be there. Eventually, she'll figure out SHE is the one that needs help (I asked her about that too with meds, but she said she has her own POSITIVE ENERGY to lean on so she stopped taking all her meds but ""positivity"" doesn't solve bipolar disorder and she's gonna break eventually... not gonna be around when she does. She can blow up on her pre-pubescent friend I guess.)

Gosh, that was a rant. Anyway, yeah, I am just really doubting myself and feeling really awful. Like I said, I'm not talking to her anymore and I'm not going on that site anymore. It's just too much. I want to write but I have no inspiration. I don't have much motivation and at this point, I just keep teetering back and forth wondering, what is the point? Because I keep getting hurt by people online and IRL, my life is miserable, I can't hold down a job, my family hates me, I feel disgusting, meds don't work, etc...

I want to die, honestly. Whether I will ever get the guts to go through with it and try (and NOT fail this time) I don't know... but regardless, I just want to die. I have tried the hotlines, I have tried the crisis text lines and I just... am at a loss. :/

Thank you for listening."
2997,Dear anon,"It is December 9th. I will commit suicide tomorrow at 12:00pm after my Microsoft SQL assessment. School doesn’t worry me much right now. My grades are alright. I’m just done, the past few months, I have had my heart broken over and over by the same person. I can’t leave, I love her too much. The only way from not getting hurt anymore is by taking a lot of painkillers and slicing my wrists."
2998,I felt like this is the place to write,"English is not my native so excuse my writing. I'm a 19yo teen that has some sadness going on in his life. I've never been a writer for these kind of things, i would normally just take a shower, sit down and cry silently. I got used to it that it doesn't even help anymore. Maybe I shouldn't write this here because people who write here are generally (at least the ones I read) suicidal because of serious things. Like physical abuse or PTSD kind of things. They say they don't commit suicide because they are cowards but wtf am I then? Living is brave? Bullshit. Killing yourself takes more self esteem and disrespect for others. That's why I'm alive right now. I'm a coward and I care for people more than I ever should. I hurt myself for people that doesn't even care who am I and just using me for self rehabilitations. Because I care about people and I believe they can be better. But I can't. I'm this, a failure in every way. There's an exam countrywide for colleges. I wanted medical school (which is really hard to get because you have to be like first 1000 in +3mil) and I wanted it just because seeing my crush having heart problems (she doesn't likes me back) and I thought maybe I can't help her but I can help others in the way I wanted to help her. But I don't feel like all the troubles worth living. There's no end for the bad things in this world. Good always gets killed or gets punished for what others do to them. And evils always get away with what they do to them. I never enjoyed being alone when I was a kid but for the few last couple years I feel happy only when I'm alone. Only when I'm in a crowd that no one knows who am I and have no idea what I'm going through. I'm not a help me kinda guy. I never ask for help, but I always help people in everyway I can. I care for people who knows me and I don't want people feeling down just because of me. Who am I to ruin someone else's life?  I used to write down an online diary but it was never this bad. I'm seriously suicidal just because I can't see a way out here. But as I said I'm a coward. I can't just jump off a cliff and end. I'm thinking about cyanides to end it all. Maybe this was the eternal sleep I always wanted can get me. Today I'll try to talk with school's psychologist. Maybe they can help. But I don't feel like they can. Because the problem is nothing. There's no problem. I just can't see a way out. My family acts my like shit. All they care is grades, they never see how I study hard that my ass hurts before I get up. My eyes are dry because of all the cryings and midday crisis. The people that brought me to this fucking world are now the responsibles for leaving it. How ironic. I thought family was the place you were supposed to get help. Feel cared and loved. But I can't fucking remember the last time my parent told me they love and care about me. Maybe that's why I'm so certain about cyanide. That way they can see what they created. Its more like revenge. But I'm still struggling because of all the people that will be affected after I commited. My crush and my really only friend now (even though she doesn't needs it. She's social, beautiful, smart etc... I can understand why she'll never like me. She's a diamond and I'm a fucking piece of coal to burn) and I don't want her to be affected because of me. She also studies for top colleges and she will get one but I don't feel like I'm ever gonna get somewhere. All the support I get from my family is that I'm doing so bad that I don't need to do anything. I'm working my ass out here and they say I never do enough. Maybe the fucking education system is shit huh? Maybe all the thing I need to remember overflows me? And they are even more mad when I study but still fail. I wish someone random just show up and shoot me in the head. I just want to die. I don't have a religion. People kill people and why can't I be the one that gets shot? Just come up and kill me. In this fucking world there's no way they are gonna get sth serious. They'll go to a minor prison for 3 months and go out to kill someone else again. Seeing people discuss about such shit things just makes me suicide more and more. I just want to keep writing and writing and maybe that way I can keep calm but no. I'm sorry for the wall of letters. Thank you if you read until here. That makes you one of the people that listens to me most. If you're suicidal, don't do it. Maybe the world outside might actually have something for you. But there's no place for me. Maybe I should do it secretly so my parent will never know I'm dead. Someone will eventually find my corpse but it'll be to late. Its hard for someone in my age to find a gun. That's why I'm thinking overdosing a pill or just take cyanide."

3001,I need help I truly want to kill myself there’s no one to stop me,
3002,Time,"I have a memory

its the third grade, i see some kid crying, screaming... i think, ""how pathetic"" ""how weak"" ""How can someone fall so low""

i cant even imagine the things my former self would have called me if he saw me.

I used to think about how no matter what happened, i would stand strong, defeat was never an option, but as im typing this post at 1:12 AM on a school day, i realize that i lied. 

I dont have the usual depression story, maybe a few similar tropes but overall, its very different than what people would expect.

Third grade - Had lots of friends, had all A's, and a shit load of confidence, i mean like holy fuck i had a shit load of confidence and pride, but where did it end up going?

fourth grade - had a decent sized friend group, was happy, and was still good looking, A's dropped to B's 

Fifth grade - Me and my friend group had entirely different schedules, i never saw them that year, i had a horrible, mean teacher, and i came home to an arguing family, i ended up drowning my sorrow in cod like any other 11/12 yr old kid. i thought about killing myself multiple times, but like i said, i was strong, i survived the rest of the year.

sixth grade - Pretty mediocre year, decent amount of new friends, amazing teachers, fun classes.

Summer - My family decided to move, due to this and my hatred for public school, I made the biggest fucking mistake in my life, i decided that i wanted to do online school. 

7th grade - Mental problems start kicking in, i start cutting myself, mixture of F's and C's, no friends, not a single one, but i pass.

Possible turning point - this is where i could have made a fresh start, but i failed, i asked to go to public school, but my parents ""didn't hear me"" and thought i still wanted to do online schooling, i should have chose public school, but the thought of having to make new friends, and entire new area, i decided to hide my feelings.

8th grade (now)

How do i even describe my life? To describe how far my mental problems have come, let me say this, i bang my head against the one to stop the voices. I know, its pretty fucking bad, i haven't actually talked to another person besides my family in a year, (not including online of course) and i dont even want to talk about my grades.

I barely shower, avoid family, and i eat 1 meal every 2 days.

All of this while my sister is becoming a doctor, yep, my sibling has a shit load of friends, a really nice boyfriend, (according to what ive seen) And shes becoming what she wanted to become in life.

If my life never steered in the wrong direction, would i have become just as successful? 

My Father literally asks me to give him a reason to take care of me, i cant come up with one, i wouldn't want me either.

my only chance of redemption is going to a public high school next year, and making friends.

im going to try and survive until then and resist the suicidal thoughts, wish me good luck.

3003,This world has gone to the gutter.,"This world has objectively turned for the worse, people have lost their values, their honor and their dignity. No wonder suicide is the second biggest cause of death world wide, there is nothing to look foward to if you are not living by the standards put by good for nothings on top of marxist movements.

This world has gone mad, so badly, that even the terms men and women are causes of offense for pussies who dont like being told the truth.

things like: If you arent black, you should be ashamed of not being, if youre not a woman you are a rapist, if you are straight you deserve nothing but bad things, if you are rich you are bad. Are common sayings now.

Im sick of just listening to the same bullshit every day from politicians who KNOW they are saying crazy shit and theres a mass of retarded fucks following them wherever they go.

That same movement uses childs as figures to take away your weapons, tell you you are killing the planet, tell you your religion is outdated and worthless.

Im not religious by any stretch of the term, but hell, this fucking world could take 1 or 2 values from a religion instead of acting like fucking animals.

Now women show their tits as a way to protest?
Let their body hair grow to ""show equality""?
What the fuck?

Im a 19 years old man who lives in a FUCKED country and sees this people as fucking idiots who dont know shit about this world and are so easy to manipulate.

Good night to everyone, and if ANYONE here on reddit still believes in values, I truly hope you make it through these tough times."
3004,"My last hope, my psychiatrist appointment was cancelled.","I had a psychiatrist appointment on the 28th of this month. I’ve been feeling so depressed and suicidal. Only reason I held on was because of the appointment with the psychiatrist. I’d finally be able to get diagnosed and get targeted treatment that might actually work. I’ve been in therapy twice and I’m on antidepressants, although I stopped taking them lately (and I ran out anyways). 

Today my dad told me it was postponed to February 8. I was devastated. Thing is, I don’t know if I can live like this for 2 more months. I don’t want to. I don’t care to. 

I felt so miserable. I went to my parents room. I kinda didn’t fully feel like myself. I felt like a mindless zombie. They have strong pain tablets and such in their drawers. I took a bunch of different ones. It’s already taking effect. God knows if it’s enough to actually end my life but I guess we will see.

I’m going outside on a walk. I have nobody to talk to, and I don’t want to. Whenever I try, it always backfires in my face. Maybe some people just aren’t meant to be alive. That’s how I feel."
3005,It's dark in here,"So, in the last 5 months I've been destroyed. Before that I was in a bad spot and going numb and not keeping myself in check, so the kind of default terrifying person I can be took over, driving everyone around me to call me a monster even tho I've been hurt by them and never once have a actually hurt them (I have the scars and er bills to prove it) so my relationship ended. And was basically convinced by everyone around me that I was a scum of the earth monster. This was right before I took a trip and started to get myself together and was doing a lot better and I was basically thrown into a deeper put than I've ever been it. Now everyone just treats me like shit. Which frankly isn't fair because I've held everyone's hand through all of they're shit and helped them more than they have helped me. And now I got fired from a good job which was one of the few things keeping me, I dunno, worth something ig. And I'm really struggling to get another. And my ""friends"" keep saying that I'm all over the map so I've tried to only be a good friend, fun, interested in them and completely ignore myself and I get nothing for weeks of effort. 

I'm just fucking tired. I've put a lot of energy into everything that could make my life better and it's gotten me approximately nowhere. People either ignore me saying that I'm not in a good spot or accuse me of lying to get attention. I'm not just freaking out and like I just want to kill myself, this is something I've given a lot of thought to and am still trying to figure out. I know that I really want to. It doesn't feel like I'm alive anymore. It feels like I'm just something that happened to be animate and going through the motions of what it's designed for. I'm utterly numb to everything, to life, to anything. I don't really feel anymore. I'm just tired. The darker side of me is really fucking evil. Part of it wants me to kill myself just so they get the trauma. Leave a note letting them know just how fucking shitty they were to me, the people that constantly preached how much they cared. Make sure they live with the burden of someone else's life for the rest of there's. Which is fucked cause there's a part of me that still really loves them so it's fucking weird. It's fucking dark in my head. The hatred I feel is basically the only thing I'm not numb to, which is obviously a good feeling. And that just makes me want to stop being alive even more. 

So yeah, that's how I feel these days. Not quite sure if suicide is the route yet but it's real fucking tempting."
3006,I’ve Seriously Considered Killing Myself for the First Time in Nine Years,"I don’t see a future left for me anymore. I hate myself for being a loner. I hate myself for being an addict. I hate myself for having ADHD and Asperger’s. I hate myself for being broke. I just want a job to pay my bills, but I’m not good enough in any way to get one. No woman would date me because I’m a piece of shit loser, so why even try. I’ve lost touch with my family. I don’t really have any friends.

I haven’t really spoken to anyone in a week. Thinking that maybe God is out there and has a purpose for my life gives hope for a certain amount of time. But it feels like the entire universe is telling me that I’m a worthless burden , and that I should die. I can hardly get out of bed. I feel like I weigh 1000 pounds and my brain has turned to jelly. I can’t even do simple tasks without getting distacted.

I have no worth to anyone. I’m just a piece of trash. It’s a relief to just say that."
3007,i cant feel anymore,im so sick of this everyday i go home and facetime and pretend im all happy and dandy when in actuality i barely feel anything anymore. my parents and i had to move away from the rest of the family and ever since its been eating away at me for the past 5 years... my sister moved out and my parents constantly fight i have close friends and ive told them that i imagine myself dead if i stare at a wall for a bit and they just joked about it... i would do it right now but honestly im just a coward who wants an easy way out... i fucking hate this

I can’t tell you how badly I’m fantasizing about stabbing someone in charge of Siri and iPhone design. 

Human bullshit pierces our daily lives everyday and shootings are more rampant. Coincidence?"
3009,Burned out,"    I’m at that point where I don’t know what to do with myself. Several failed relationships, non-existent family,  broke, unemployed,  devoid of talent.nearly incapable of focusing or concentrating on anything and have a really hard time making friends. People always say be the real you but once people get to know the real me they forget me. 
    It’s crazy how even online people want nothing to do with me. I find myself looking at notifications and it’s hardly ever  anyone commenting on what I’ve posted. I leave posts in groups that get ignored and honestly in just starting to feel invisible. Like I don’t exist. Like if I disappeared tomorrow, no one would notice but my mom, and honestly considering what she’s put up with, I think it would be doing her a favor. 
   I’m too much of a coward to kill myself, and I dont have the motivation to do anything because what’s the point?  Sure there’s so much more to life but honestly I don’t even really care. I went to get help at the clinic and their appointments are so late. I don’t have that much time. 
   Mom put me up in a motel after my ex kicked me out after I lost my job and I’m sure ppl would be like hey somebody likes you but it’s not like that. I think she felt sorry for me, and that’s an even worse feeling. I don’t want anyone’s pity anymore. I’m unsure on where my future lies. I have a few days left and I’ve applied to about 30+ jobs. I had an interview, went well I thought, guy told me I should hear from him, and well yea...not holding my breath
And I just cracked my phone for the 3rd time. I just want to find to courage to do what I need to do. I feel like I need to free my mom. She says it’s not that bad but I’m legit all the family she got left so I feel like she’ll just gas me up to keep me around. Moms are great right? We’re both only children. I’m about to be 30 with no kids and I’m sure this is where our legacy ends.
    Don’t get me wrong I love my mom, and there are things that I like in life but my tank is empty and I don’t have it in me to gas myself anymore. Where do useless people go or what do they do? Why is suicide such a bad thing? What if a person is hurting so agonizingly bad inside that  continuing on living torturous. I wake up mad that I even opened my eyes on some days and welcome a peaceful release. I’ll gladly be a martyr for a good cause if anyone has some ideas. At least so that I can feel useful in death.
I’m down feeling sorry for myself. I’m done feeling. Before I wrote this I cried the hardest I ever have and now I just feel numb..."
3010,It has been 1 year since I attempted suicide.,"Well more like I started the process but chickened out. I had taken a small handful of sleeping pills and then snapped out of it.

No one knows this happened except my counselor. Not even my boyfriend at the time, who I had dated for 1.5 years until we split 3 months ago, knew about it. 

If anyone wants to know, I am in a significantly better place today. I am definitely not ""happy"" but I can't see myself trying again anytime soon. I haven't self-harmed since around March and I don't cry myself to sleep everyday now. I may relapse in a few months or weeks or even days, since I'm still on an edge quite often. Who knows. But right now I don't detest life. I can see myself getting even better, possibly.

I can't speak for anyone else, but personally I'm glad I gave myself another chance. It got better for me, and I hope it gets better for you too."
3011,Everyone and I do mean Everyone is against me,"My whole life I’ve never been allowed to just be. ie all of my coworkers could be venting about something and yet if I voice a gripe I get tattled on. Any so called friend I’ve had will use any morsel of info against me ie fav food etc. and I get ridiculed to for it. I mention a cool place I visited and suddenly I’m bragging, yet anyone else can share parts of their lives and they’re left alone. 

At work I try to stay out of the fray and I’m always singled out if I make a tiny error yet if someone is constantly late or rude it’s simply overlooked. I’m forever waking a tight rope. I no longer trust anyone or anything and don’t see the point in living. People say to open up but I share even the slightest thing and it’s used against me. I clam up and suddenly I’m unapproachable. 

I’ve been bullied, ostracized, gossiped about, belittled and people have said the most horrific things to my face. Envy, jealousy has been suggested but I don’t think that theory holds true. There are better looking and more successful people all around me and they’re left alone, met with reverie even. 

I don’t understand it. People hate me and now I hate myself right along with them. 

I hate all of humanity."
3012,dont know what to do,I'm in 10th grade at a private school. Everyone leaves me out and ignores me. I used to be friends with everyone and now they just act like I don't exist.

I previously posted on this sub reddit talking about my best friend who killed himself (title is my best friend killed himself 8 hours ago) if you wanted the back story. I have always had suicidal thoughts but now they are getting worse. it’s constantly on my mind but i’m too scared to do it, i’m just too scared of the unknown. i can’t help but overthink about everything that has happened since that fucking day. at first i was numb when i got the news but now i am breaking down hard. i don’t know how much longer i can go on like this. i’m supposed to visit my psychiatrist in january but that’s just so far away. i don’t know what to do it feels like my brain is about to explode."
3015,If there anything left?,"Its been a long heartbreaking year. Im tired of life. I have no energy for daily anything anymore. I feel like i really dont exist at this point. Im exhausted from the monotony of everyday life. Feeling like im only a ghost floating through life with no goal, no dream, no direction. Nothing in this life makes me feel alive. I dont want it anymore. Theres people dying who want to live. Can i give it to them? Ill sell it for free if i could just disappear into the darkness."
3016,I don’t even deserve writing this post yet my arrogance wont let me alone,"Everyday of my life i have been given everything i needed and wanted and i haven’t been able to give anything worthy in exchange im a failure and a disappointment not only for my parents but also for my friends. I can’t event get more than 50% in my grades. Everyone from my parents to my friends and even my own girlfriend  have put their hopes on me and i can’t do anything in response to it. My partner is a wonderful person who treats excellent and i don’t deserve her at all she should be with someone as perfect as her. My parents have always been careful to teach me everything to become successful  and i haven’t done anything worth of their attention in my life. Disappointment after disappointment i continue to go deeper into and invisible void of hate towards everyone who is a stranger but also hate towards myself. Everyone at school is an idiot that only lives for immediate pleasures, they’re a bunch of alcoholic sex addicts that don’t do no good to society. Few little of my teachers are actually good human beings because the rest are bunch of old useless hypocritical pieces of shit. I hate them all and i hate myself too and if i am really playing on ending my life I’ll rather kill everyone else too because that’s all i really are a complete selfish proud piece of shit that only lives by the day. Im not sure how should i do it but probably i wouldn’t go for throwing myself of a building as high as possible. Although then again im too lazy for even climb up that high"
3017,I can't fucking take it I really want to kill myself I wish my wrist was slit during work but no it had to be a close one God I hate fucking living another miserable day,
3018,I wanna kill myself,I really want to leave the note and jump off.
3019,what kept you from giving in?,"Up until now I’ve never been suicidal but over the course of a little less than a year my life has crumbled before my eyes. I’m only 19 so I started college and had issues with adhd medication and medical issues and severe depression. That whole year was a sad depressed mess but I was still hopeful. Then the pain kicked in. At first it was just neck pain that wouldn’t stop. Went to chiropractor for months to treat degenerative disc and nothing helped. Finally went to specialist for mri and I have a herniated disc but despite all 4 drs I’ve seen they all dismiss everything and give me painkiller after painkiller that doesn’t help so I’m at physical therapy and all this other stuff. This year I’ve had medication issues and more health problems and now I’m failing 2 classes after not having the right meds and I’ll lose my scholarship and my moms already taking out another job to pay for medical shit so idk how we’re gonna afford this too. The pain has now spread from my neck to my shoulders, mid and lower back, coccyx, shoulder blades, both arms, elbows, wrists, and fingers. I literally cannot function anymore the pain is constant and nothing is helping I’ve tried fucking everything and still nobody can pinpoint what’s wrong or how to fix it it’s fucking excruciating I can’t take it anymore I can barely work or even dress myself and classes are near impossible to sit through. Everything over the past few months, the pain, meds, health issues, college, anxiety over college shit that’s fucking me over and I can’t stop it, feeling like a burden to my parents, like I’m draining my parents money for medical help, and now my mom is upset w me bc she can’t take my shit anymore??? Apparently having all my problems dumped on her (even tho she told me to tell her what’s wrong) is too much and she barged I go my dorm tonight to yell at me for it and being too depressing on Facebook????? There’s even more going on and shit that’s built up over years including trauma and mental illness  and all of a sudden tonight I think I finally snapped and I’m actually suicidal for the first time in my life so I’m scared and don’t know what to do esp since my main support system (parents) can’t stand hearing anymore and I haven’t slept in days or eaten from meds and I’m tired and I feel so fucking alone and I’m scared I don’t know what to do at this point dying is the only available solution for my pain and outside problems but I can’t do that to my pets or my parents or anyone and I’m too chicken but anyways I need advice
What kept you afloat or prevented you from every going thru with it? I don’t want to die but my brain won’t stop telling me that it’s the only solution. I feel numb and alone and done. Please help."
3020,I hate every single part of living.,"I'm thinking of leaving the house and walking in to traffic tonight.

I hate the feeling of air filling my lungs. I hate the feeling of my heart beating. I hate the feel of wind on my skin. I hate trying to connect with people, only to feel more lonely than ever. I hate the way I look. I hate the way OTHER people look. I hate how flawed and unlikable I am. I hate that the only affection I've ever received was as a joke at my expense. I hate existing, and most of all, I hate myself.

People say to enjoy the small things, but I can't enjoy anything. Everything just shits me to tears. Mindfulness exercises make me feel uncomfortable because I hate the feeling of even having a body. Every sensation inside myself is deeply unpleasant, and even when my body is “relaxed,” I feel irritated by all the sensations I feel. The tingling in my scalp when I close my eyes, the sharp bolts of numbness that creep through my body like nails being pushed through my skin... there's nothing physically wrong with me, but I feel these things all the time. I can't even escape my depression in focusing on the now.

What fucking hope is there? I have no patience left for the disgusting dreg-heap that is existence. I hope this whole universe folds in on itself and crushes everything back to endless nothingness. I hope nobody escapes, and I hope it fucking hurts. When my heart stops beating, it'll be full of hate not just for myself, but for the universe that allowed me to exist in the first place. Let's hope that'll be tonight."
3021,I’m tired causing pain towards people who I care about,"Every since I got into a temporary break all hell broke lose. I can’t eat, think, be happy and etc. I’m planning my own death at the Jan 5. Today my best friend knew the situation and it make me feel such a scumbag for making him sad. And I hate myself for making well now my ex girlfriend feel pain because I keep talking about it. I don’t want them to suffer anymore. However, I can’t stop thinking how much trouble I cause them.  I don’t even deserve to live anymore."
3022,Failed my Senior Class. Won't Be Graduating On-Time. Came Close to Ending It.,"Just a vent.

I couldn't complete my project, despite having months to do it. So, I had to sign up to re-do the class. Because of the absolutly stupid way the classes are being offered next semester, I won't be graduating until this time next year....IF I don't fuck it all up yet again.

I'm so anxious and brain-fogged. I don't want to do anything except sleep, and the future feels too much to bear if I keep going like this."
3023,Currently crying outside of my job,"Just clocked out, and whatever. 

But I'm so fucking unhappy and lately it's just been turning into anger, I'm so genuinely angry and sad."
3024,I want to plunge a knife into my chest,"I’ve got no one left, i keep running the knife across my chest fantasizing about it."
3025,.,Someones not gonna come to my rescue. Nobody cares. If I sit around waiting for my problems to fix themselves im done for. Nothing is going to change unless I do. I keep feeling trapped in my mind lamenting about things I need to get over. I need to save myself.
3026,"once i’m done with finals, then i’ll know","i sort of have a plan in place; more of a “I really think i’m gonna do it” than a solid blue print if that makes sense. i’ve struggled with suicide ideation for the last 3 years of my life but my thoughts have never been as intense as they are now. i even have rough drafts of goodbye letters. but I don’t have a method or a particular day in mind yet because i’ve been trying to focus on school and right now; i haven’t given it much thought because what would i do if i were to fail? i’d fall behind in everything and have to deal with the repercussions. 

but once i’m done with finals and the semester, I won’t have anything to worry about for the meantime and i’ll have time to think. part of me kind of hopes that the time i’ll finally have will make me realize that maybe I do want to live, idk. a real world sign would be so, so nice. but for now, I need to get back to studying."
3027,Thank you,"Thank you to everyone who has Dmed me on reddit and other platforms to tell me that I am worth it, it has helped allot and I’m sorry if I sound like I don’t care because I do, but it will take a while for me to feel better.. I am still having these thoughts daily and I almost acted in them today, but I thought about the people who have said nice things and it saved me... I’ll keep you all updated, until then... thank you reddit"
3028,Goddamn fish and reddit made me suicidal tonight. I'm pathetic.,"One of my many throwaway accounts here....

Long story short, I've already had a hell of a day at work. I'm in a pretty high risk job, and after getting seriously injured last summer at work, I was asked to step in and do the same job I was doing when I was injured. I've been having symptoms like anxiety and minor panic attacks occasionally sense, and today was hard. 

So I get home and need to suddenly rehouse my fish outside, because the water and pump froze unexpectedly. I shouldn't have let it stay out this cold. Except I've been trying to find someone else to take these fish for awhile, I had a plan A and plan B for them but they fell through... plan C is bring them inside anyway but I just dont have space to adequately care for them inside. 

Anyway. I made a post on r/aquariums looking for ideas on what to do, feeling like a complete asshat for putting my fish in a tiny tank and admitting it. Fully admitting I knew the tank is too small. Just hoping for some kind of hope or ideas for help. 

And instead I just get validation. That I'm a fucking incompetent asshole incapable of doing anything right right now. I can barely make it through a day of work since I got hurt, and now I cant even take care of simple goldfish. I used to care for and breed advanced fish, sick and I'll rescues, saltwater, inverts, reptiles all kinds of animals. Now I cant even take care of myself. 

And just admitting that some randos on reddit pushed me over the edge of a bad day to a suicidal one, i just feel even worse. More pathetic and useless. Like, who let's strangers affect them that much? Just cause they reminded me what i already knew and tried to tell them? I've already relapsed with my self injury tonight and idk how much more i cant take before i just finish it."
3029,I will kill myself on the 1st of January,"  As title says. I have been in ER 4 times since july, i have been hospitalized, and on suicide watch. The psychologists have done fuck all, they send me to some ""specialists in depression"", but they aswell are equally useless. My parents do more harm than good with their stupid comments and ""support"". My friends have no clue what depression even feels like sonce they have perfect lives, and cannot relate to anything i try to explain, which just ends up in them also doing more harm than good (not knowing it). I keep cutting myself, and take way more than my daily dose of anti anxiety pills. Im become more and more restless, because 1st of january could not come quicker. I feel like im a parking ticket from jumping off a bridge. I feel like i just want to tear my flesh appart. Thanks to the 2 people reading this, if even that happens"
3030,The worst thing about a suicide attempt is if survived it you have to live with the scars,"This is part of the reason why I’m afraid to really attempt killing myself. I say really because my left arm is covered up scars of me cutting myself. In different areas the scars are deeper than the others because I was trying to kill myself but like always I coward outta of it. I guess I don’t really don’t want die but want to escape my life. I haven’t lived the best life, definitely wasn’t good human being. I just don’t feel like I deserve to live and I should go to hell. I always look for shortcut, manipulate people to get ahead and life is finally getting to me and I feel like I’m ready to pay the price with my life. I know that there is better human beings that lost their life and that deserve to live than me."
3031,I Can't do this anymore,
3032,Maybe not now but...,"I share these things here because I don’t have anyone that cares to listen to me in person. I thought I had escaped the temptation, the conclusion that suicide was the right choice but it’s back again. Everyone else in my life has something else to think about, to talk about, to concern themselves with other than me. I want to be able to downplay my emotional pain but I cannot. I’m well fed, sheltered, generally comfortable but completely dissatisfied with the life I have made for myself. I genuinely believe removing myself as a consumer of goods and services, as a blip on the radar of the few remaining people who care is likely my best contribution. I’m pretty sure a friend of mine just offend himself— they never disclosed the official cause of his death— and while his death haunts me, I think I understand. It won’t be tomorrow or the day after but within the first few months of the new year, I am confident I’ll end my own life allowing others to more throughly flourish in theirs."
3033,Should I kill myself?,"Pros:
The pain would finally stop
Wouldn’t have to deal with failing my finals
Life is pointless anyway, so why am I allowing myself to go through all this crap
To send a message to my abuser

Cons:
My family would be devastated
I would miss Christmas
What if I want a long life and years and years of memories? 
What if this is just my depression not allowing me to see the good in life or whatever?

I’ve been reading everyone’s posts, and it looks like a lot of us are in the same boat. I feel like this is a big decision that needs to be made with reason, not emotion, but I still can’t decide."
3034,Heaven and Hell?,"Does anyone fear Hell? Does anyone believe in Heaven? 
I was told that if I kill myself I won’t go to heaven. I wanna know my chances."
3035,Preperation,"After fighting for 6 years i'm too tired to keep this going, i've started writing letters to those that i'm leaving here and it's helping give me focus, It seems odd but knowing that people will hear me once i'm gone is comforting at the very least."
3036,"I just started a new job and I want to quit because of my anxiety and panic attacks. If I quit, I will want to kill myself.","No matter what job I do, unless it's at home on my computer, I'm struggling with severe anxiety. Dread, panic attacks, crying. I count down the hours until I can go home, and then immediately when I go home, I feel more anxiety as each hour passes because I have to go to work the next day. I hate small talk and talking to strangers in general. I had my first day at a doggie daycare facility and it was extremely stressful and overstimulating. I have been crying since I got home. I feel suicidal and like I can't go in tomorrow. How do I quit? I feel like I'm going to have to kill myself if I quit since I can't support myself like a normal adult."
3037,I can't stop the flash backs,"I've had a few... let's just say traumatic experiences. I recovered pretty fast, especially considering what happened, but lately things have changed.

There are a few people who are often around a place where my friend group hands out, who are really insensitive about the topic of my trauma. They never shut up.

They're the reasons I've had a lot more trauma flashbacks, and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel disgusted with myself, and can't look in the mirror much.

I want to die. I don't want to tell my friends- I feel like my other issues because of that are burden enough to them. I can't keep living like this."
3038,How do people have energy to live,"I can barely breath I have no energy or motivation to do anything, all I want is to stay home I don’t wanna go to school or work anymore it’s so miserable I feel sad thinking about my life"
3039,I am going to hang myself,"Don’t even know why I’m writing here. I guess it’s my primate instincts’ last resort of some sorts. I’m scared of death, sure, but not any more than what the life brings. I’m tired."
3040,It’s so painful to live I can’t take it anymore,I’ve ruined my life by my own hand my lack of motivation and uselessness . I can’t keep a job I’m horrible at school. How does everyone do daily activities like working and studying while I feel like I’m dead and can’t get anything done . Please help me my life is passing by
3041,Should I wait until after finals,"17F. Bad life at a breaking point you've read it all before.
I'm fully prepared to do this.
I'm not prepared for it not working.
I'm afraid that if it doesn't, ill wake up in a hospital to even more stress.
Does it make more sense to do it now or after finals? I don't want to wake up and be bothered with failing all my 1st semester classes, god forbid I wake up. I don't want to wake up to anything.
I don't know where else to ask this.
I know its a weird question.
I know it makes it seem like I'm looking for a reason out. I'm not.
I just need some opinions. I'm buying supplies and cleaning up my things either way.
Thanks."
3042,Trying to fight off suicidal urges without going to the hospital because I refuse to go there after some horrible experiences,"I've gone to the hospital twice now. I had a horrible experience and clearly it didn't help either time because I feel the same and the last time I went was over 6 months ago



I really REALLY want to kill myself. And I have the noose ready, I could at any moment. I've been taking sleeping pills and/or drinking alcohol and/or smoking weed to physically stop myself from suicide every night. I'm a danger to myself and I SHOULD be in the hospital. But no, I won't go.




I can't go to any other hospital because insurance so I know the experience would be the same. Both times I've gone I left SIGNIFICANTLY worse than when I went in. I was terrified. A nurse physically mistreated a patient and humiliated him in front of everyone at the same time. I was scared of what they'd do to me. Maybe I'm paranoid, but still. I'm not gonna go back. If a cop pulled up in my driveway to try to take me I WOULD kill myself. Going to the hospital right now would set me over the edge and I'd end it before I could get there.




So yeah that sucks. I'm trying my fucking best but so far that just means taking enough benadryl to knock me out or getting drunk enough that I physically can't kill myself because lying down with the spins.




This really isn't life. This isn't living this is surviving and barely surviving at that. Don't have anything that brings me joy anymore. Every second is just numbness and boredom. Just complete and utter disinterest and apathy toward literally everything. Don't clean, shower, cook, go see anyone, exercise, do anything at all. Basically go to work (somehow. Usually late and performance is shit), then come home and take whatever psychoactive substance I feel like at the moment and try to distract myself until I fall asleep again.



Yeah life is a beautiful gift guys, go ahead and have babies"
3043,HOW DO I KILL MYSELF FAST AND PAINLESS,I DO NOTWANT TO GO TO SCHOOL TMO
3044,Nobody even reads my SW posts,"I’m tired of being the stupid kid that can’t fit in. I’m tired of being lonely and having no friends. I’m tired of always being the worthless piece of shit no one cares about. 

I just want to die. Nobody would care if I killed myself. I wish I just did it in sixth grade."
3045,I can't keep going on like this,"Suffering, indifference, more suffering, more indifference, watching my family wither away and not being able to do anything about it, being almost 23 yet with the mind of a 17 year old at most, having a very small support network, college stress... I just can't keep doing this, I've tried everything...

Fluoxine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertraline, going to therapy, trying to improve and do new things, and for what? Life keeps throwing more and more troubles, it's just too much!"
3046,I feel like giving up,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I don’t fit in anywhere I go and I’m constantly in a state of fear that people are laughing at me behind my back. Now here I am a senior in college 10 weeks from graduation and I have no will to keep going. The crushing deadlines, the stress of all the things I need to do, the pain of being an outcast in all my classes. It’s getting to be too overwhelming. 

It’s weird that my goal for so long has been to just complete college so my parents would be proud of me for something. Now I’m so close but it feels like the end of the line. I have no plans for after graduation and I’ve pretty much given up on life at this point anyway. So I find myself thinking “well if I’m going to die then what’s the point of even graduating?”

I’m just kinda lost and confused honestly, I don’t think I really want to die but I have no desire to keep living either. I just want a bit of relief for all this."
3047,Can you believe it? I want to pull the trigger but I can't deal with not knowing the 'unknown' ahead of time? I am fucked up - LOL,"I've been reading the posts on this forum for the past few weeks.  It breaks my heart but at the same time I get this weird feeling of comfort knowing that I am not the only one that wants to commit suicide.  I have been planning my suicide for quite a while but based on many different events that have happened in my life.  Now I feel that I really want to go through with it.

So I bought a gun, a new Sig 9mm Legion.  I guess I want to go in style but also want to make sure the bullet does maximum destruction.  I've read enough about the human anatomy and the base of the brain that I know where I want to aim the gun.  I have practiced putting the gun in my mouth and pulling the trigger.  However, I can't get my brain to accept that I can do it with a real bullet!

How do you condition yourself to be able to pull the trigger?  I think I'm afraid of what happens next.  I tell myself that next is basically nothingness.  You just don't exist anymore.  But that thought seems so illogical that I can't comprehend non-existence.  Does anyone else have these problems?  Is there any way of getting past the instinctive need to survive?  

Thanks for reading/listening."
3048,"i want to die, but im too much of a chicken to try anything because im afraid of surviving.",what do i do
3049,Should i write a note?,"i know i will be causing pain for those i leave behind but i want to go and i want to protect them.  
how do i say i don't want any of them to blame themselves?

how do i say i just couldn't like like this anymore?

how do i say i know i have it good but i just want to die?

or should i just not say anything?   


should i do personal notes or just one big note?

I guess i have some time. i don't plan to kill myself until next year. even tho i'd like to right now. i don't want to ruin any plans that have been made."
3050,I’m getting real close boys,That is all
3051,I don't have the strength to go on anymore.,"My name is Alexandra/Alex, I'm a 32 year old trans-girl 6 months into transition.

I'm not sure if I want to go on anymore, my life so far has been a horror story and I feel like there's only one route of escape. I've been abused and taken advantage of by my family for all of my 32 years on this earth, the pain never leaves no matter how many medications my Dr. puts me on, I'm currently on 11 medications of which only 3 are transition related.

I've never escaped my family, my childhood was very traumatic and shortly after graduating high school I fell into a series of deep depressions that crippled me, I later found out this was Bipolar II disorder. My father became sick with dementia during this depressive period and my brother and mother pressured me into becoming the primary caregiver to him, I did this for 7 highly stressful/painful years until he died suddenly one night in front of me. I tried to revive him with CPR to no avail and got his blood smeared on my arm and face which sometimes I can still see in the mirror. Now I take care of my mother who's become visually impaired in the last couple years and a brother who's on his 2nd Dui and I act as a taxi driver to them and take care of most of their affairs.

I'm destitute and live off the good graces of my mother who makes my life infinitely more difficult with her constant demands and she refuses to get any type of help through social services. I have a laundry list of psychiatric diagnoses including Bipolar disorder, GAD, SAD, OCD, ADHD, PTSD, and Gender Dysphoria, yup, that's right I'm a trans woman also. I'm transitioning in secret to avoid another suicide attempt of which I've already had two. My family knows nothing about my psychiatric issues and I'm trying my best to keep things together and escape their clutches by saving up the pittance my mother gives me in cash.

I'm losing faith, I'm crippled by all my illnesses, despite years of therapy and attempts to get a job and get my life on track I've never been able to maintain functioning. I don't know how far I'm going from here, I just want to be the gender I should have been, live a content life, but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen. I think I'll might blow my brains out with a shotgun in the next couple months. I just needed to get some of this off my chest. I feel like a pathetic human being and the flashbacks keep taunting as well as dysphoria, I don't know if I can or want to fight anymore, this life has been a constant battle and I'm so very tired. I feel physically ugly and I'm probably fooling myself that I can ever transition and be a passable woman, the days get darker as time moves along and I don't know how to light my way anymore."
3052,"Is 2,700mg Prozac + sleeping pills enough to go?",
3053,I'm getting harassed by someone I knew and I don't know what to do anymore,He messaged me to mess with me and said abusive things to me. I don't know what to do and he's a mind game player so Reddit may not ban his account and not see it as outwardly abusive. I told him to leave me alone and that I was already suicidal but he just called me a drama queen for that.
3054,I don’t feel brave for not committing suicide,People keep telling me that I am brave and strong for continuing to live despite me wanting to die. I feel more like a coward who is to weak and pathetic to find the courage to finally end my miserable life. Instead I keep moving forward for no other reason besides the fact that I can’t bring myself to end it.
3055,I got fired from my job,"Now I’m really done with life , I’m fired because I’m not motivated to work or do anything, my boss scold me a lot and call me stupid which made hate going to work and I started calling in sick which resulted in me getting fired. I’m relieved that I don’t have to deal with this crap anymore but it’s make me feel like a looser and that I can’t keep a job I can’t even force myself to work I’m really is useless."
3056,You have to care about yourself to feel sad,"I honestly hate myself so much that I don’t even feel depressed anymore... just completely empty. When I cry it’s for my family and the people who love me, because they deserve so much better than an empty shell of a daughter. The only reason I’ve stayed alive for the last few years is because of them, but I’m at the point where I just can’t do this anymore. I’m wasting resources and my family’s emotional energy."
3057,Need help,"Haven't been outside for a week now. Haven't talked to anyone and nobody knows where or how I am.
As soon as I leave the house I just feel an urge to get back inside.
Thinking about talking to anyone makes me cry.
If I go to school or go shopping I'd just burst into tears.

I just don't know what to do.
Not been eating properly that week. Just some stuff left over. I'm sleeping all day and the time I'm awake I spend reading, playing or just lying in bed thinking about what's wrong with me.

Just feel like life isn't worth living.
Just want to die."
3058,PLEASE HELP MY FRIEND,"PLEASE HELP MY FRIEND

Ok, so my friend has been contemplating suicide for a while and so far we’ve been able to help him, but now it’s coming really close to where he said he might do it tomorrow. His grandpa who he was really close with just died and he’s not coming to school tomorrow. PLEASE in the comments tell him how much he is cared for and how this is not the answer.  PLEASE give him advice on what to do and just HELP HIM! I’m not asking for upvotes here but please spread the word. He is truly a great friend and I don’t want him to go this way. Please just send kind words his way."
3059,Killing myself,i dont know if this is the right place to do this. But I'll be gone so whatever. It's been a terrible year. My close friend and mentor shot himself. My debt is rising. Im about to lose my job. I can't pay bills. I can't live like this anymore. I think I just want to rest. I don't have the heart to tell anyone so I'm just posting this here. Thanks for reading all.
3060,Any positive stories of overcoming big failures?,"Hey folks, 

Long story cut short: 

\&gt; Currently going through Police and Courts, while trying to do my law degree suspended due to false allegations 

\&gt; ex-GF is psycho / mentally ill and caused all of it .

What are your stories of big failures in your life that you overcame and lived to tell? 

What meaning do you attach to them to process them? And when you go to that 'dark place' in your mind, how do you interpret your life etc?"
3061,A real thing I wrote simply titled ( Why? ),"Why?
    Why do I do this to myself. I hold onto the mistakes I made big or small and taunt myself with them. Holding on the to things that make me want to die instead of good people and good moments. I want a home. A place I can belong to and be accepted in but I feel like a reject. I wish I was loved. Genuinely loved. Because everyone but my family wouldn’t notice if I just disappeared. My heart and mind are shattered. I can’t take anymore of the these ideas. That I’m hopeless, pointless, ugly, fat, unlikeable, and unfunny. I can’t help to think that people go through worse things on a daily basis and yet I can’t even handle what’s thrown at me. I box up feelings and throw then away because I don’t think I’m supposed to cry. Right? As a guy I’m supposed to be tough no? It doesn’t work. I haven’t done anything of worth of praise in a while. People find my funny. I think the biggest joke of all is my existence. I too scared to ask for help. Too scared for people to see me as a crazy person. I’m not. I’m hurt. The wounds just to deep down to see. Why am I writing this? Good question. Too bad it doesn’t have a good answer. Nobody cares. Not about a some guy you hardly talk to. (To bad I ain’t got the guts to do something about it)We all make mistakes. To bad I can’t get over mine. It hurts being this unlike. Never had a true friend. Not real or imaginary. At least I can make people laugh. Whether at me or with me at least I can me someone’s day better. I just want it to stop. All of it. I can take it anymore. I hope one day I have the guts too kill myself. I’m a hot mess
      Your friendly neighborhood nobody,
                                        Deli
(I know it doesn’t explain much but just need to get this off my chest somewhere)"
3062,Im tired of living,"Ive been feeling so bad for so long. i cant say the last time ive actually even felt happy or sad im just numb to the core. My sleeping is all over the place, im always tired. I lose grip with reality often and hurt myself in the process. It just sucks and i really dont know how much more of it i can deal with."
3063,Bipolar 2,Didn’t know it was a thing till I got diagnosed with it. Now I don’t know where bipolar stops and where I begin.
3064,"I cant go through with it, but I cant take it off my mind either.","I have been thinking about it for about 4 years now. I always reach the same conclusion in the end. I can't do it. Although I cant understand why they love me, my family does, and I cant imagine how they would feel if I were gone. I've wanted to off myself because I'm tired of the struggles, and the world around me. But the most important thing, I hate myself. I dislike my character, my actions. Even my own thoughts bug me. I just simply don't wanna live anymore. I don't feel comfortable talking about this to anyone. I just wanna die and not have to worry about were I would go, or how my family would feel."
3065,Need someone to talk to,I've been avoiding attempting it because every time I've tried in the past I always survive and end up with more problems than I had before. No one in my life knows I'm this suicidal or that I'm going through anything at all. I don't trust anyone that knows me to open up to because every time I've tried to in the past it didnt go well. I really feel like my head is going to explode. I've been suicidal since I was a kid but it keeps progressively getting worse. Lately it's all I can think about like my mind is a broken record that's just repeating the same suicidal thoughts over and over again
3066,Is it depression?,"Copied from where I posted it on r/AskDocs cuz  its  a  mouthful  to  type  again:

I’m sure you guys get a lot of these on here, and I know it is more or less impossible to diagnose depression over a few lines on reddit, but I’d like to know what you think.  
I’ve been feeling really depressed the last couple of years. I am 19 years old, and I dropped out of school when I was 14, after I finished the 8th grade. My parents wouldn’t let me continue on to high school, and I’ve spent more or less every day, 7 days a week 365 days a year at home since then. It feels so incredibly isolating, and I feel like I am missing out on so much.

I love having people to talk to, I used to talk to my grandmother for hours on end before she suffered a stroke a few years and became more or less incapable of carrying on a conversation. Since then I’ve had no one. I know it sounds absolutely crazy, but on the rare occasion I get the chance to meet someone new or carry on a conversation with someone I get the weirdest elating feeling. It’s what I imagine being high feels like, it‘s like a rush and it feels just indescribably wonderful.

I went to take the SAT exam yesterday (I passed the GED and I’m hoping to go to college), and I met a couple of high school seniors who were taking the test in the same room as I was. We talked for a little while, and although it was incredibly awkward (I have trouble dealing with social cues and I never know how to respond well in a conversation, not to mention it’s difficult to relate to other people), it felt amazing to be around people my age for the first time in *sooo* long. They were just amazing to be around, and it was almost like loosing someone when we left, it almost hurt. Afterwards, and since then, I’ve felt just awful, beyond how depressed I usually feel. I feel so alone, especially now with all of the college application stress and no one to talk to.

By the end of the day, each day, I usually feel completely drained. It’s sort of like an exhausted or really tired feeling, but I’m not necessarily tired. I’m sure it sounds weird, but I also often cry a lot before bed at night. It feels sort of relieving and sometimes helps me to fall asleep. There are a lot of things going on at home, way too much to explain in a single Reddit post, but I think it would suffice to say I am a live-in maid to my family. I spend a ton of time (most of the day, every day) doing things for them: cleaning, cooking, etc. Besides feeling depressed, I’ll often go into one or two week spans where I can‘t sleep well.

I should tack on a bit of background that may be relevant. My father for years was an alcoholic, and my parents did (and still do) get into huge arguments. My mother has left for weeks to months at a time several times, and frequently threatens to do so again. My father, when he would drink, used to have an awful temper and the smallest things would piss him off to the point you‘d be pelted with chairs or verbally abused for hours. At one point he shot one of my pet cats off of our top step while I was asleep a few feet away on the sofa.

After the 5th grade, my father pulled me and my sister out of school and we both spent a year basically locked in our house. My father never liked the lights on and I didn’t have a bedroom so I more or less spent the entirety of a year in our dining room in the dark. When I went back to school for the 6th grade everyone was concerned, they told me I was acting strange. I suddenly found it incredibly difficult to talk to people and I had awful anxiety (to the point I was shaking). A psychiatrist (?) on Reddit once told me I was at an age where I was especially susceptible “contracting“ social anxiety (I think is the term he/she used) and that may have caused physical changes in the way my brain developed and processed social situations.

A couple of years ago I also dealt with what may have been an eating disorder. I was overweight and I hated it and what people had to say about it, so I spend close to a year eating very little in hopes I would loose weight fast. I ended up dropping from 6’1” 195 lbs to 5’11” 107-ish lbs (my doctors could explain the height loss). I did several blood tests (i know one was a metabolic panel) and seen a few specialists and everyone said I seemed perfectly healthy aside from my weight.

I also suffer from frequent headaches. They aren’t usually very painful, but they bother me and make it difficult to concentrate"
3067,This will shock you,"So..I suffer from one of the rarest diseases in the world called PGAD. It affects your down-below area and you can do very little about it. It is constant 24/7 arousal, sometimes mixed with pain, sometimes not. It's similar to tourette and chrone's disease.

I have tried quite a few things and I've been to various specialists who specialize in different things.

Literally once percent or less of all doctors have ever heard of this diseases which is why it can't be diagnosed by my doctors. I know that I have it cause it's been there for 3 years almost every day.

I was planning on getting my down-below parts removed until I found our that this could lead to sepsis, uncontrollable blood loss and anal discharge.

I'll never be cured and I suffer everyday for the rest of my life. 

WHY SHOULD I CONTINUE?"
3068,sorry - 12/9/19 - 9:53 pm to 10:28 pm,"some 18+ mentions up ahead.

as the decade comes to an end, i realize now that my life has always been messed up. not as bad as others, but i'm not strong enough for it to seem as small as it really is. if i kill myself at any point in time, please read this and you'll know why.

before i start, let me say, i'm struggling with gender identity as i'm typing this so let's just say i'm young and non-binary, born female.

\--------

when i was born, i had and have multiple sicknesses. none are really visible, and i'm not sure exactly what they are, but i have a very distinct scar on my lower stomach. 

from ages 1-4 i lived with my grandmother, my mom, my dad, and my uncle. my uncle was and is severely depressed, and just started abusing drugs at this point. i don't remember much from this time in my life, but it was mostly happy. he made a video/movie about his life and i was in it. there was alot of violence and i remember that in the film, my mother was being chased by a man with a gun. i've had a fear of my mother being killed ever since then.

from ages 5-9 i moved to a new house with my parents, but i visited my grandmother frequently and her house was kind of like a safe place to me. around age 6 or 7, the same man who chased my mother with a gun in the film (he was a friend of ours) came to our house, drunk, and assaulted both of my parents with either a pistol or a bat (can't remember). my step brother sexually assaulted me multiple times, and my grandmother had to sell her house. my uncle attempted to kill himself by ODing on drugs in our bathtub. some guy my age at the time touched me in places that i wished he didn't.

ages 10-11, i started feeling depressed and thought about self harm. came out to my parents as pansexual by having a breakdown in front of them. i started having frequent visits with a school counselor. another guy my age kept calling me things like ""his sex toy"" or ""slut"" and he'd always tell me about an nsfw dream he had about me, him, and another guy.

age 12 up until now. started cutting, lying to my parents, getting into toxic relationships. was manipulated into being in a relationship with some girl i didn't like. was sent to therapy. drove/hiked through an EF1 tornado, one of my best friends passed away, my step-brother was kicked out of the house and i've only seen him once since then. my boyfriend, who was the only person i trusted at the time, ghosted and cheated on me, my friend calls me every night saying she's going to hurt or kill herself, and i almost committed suicide."
3069,I want to do it before christmas,"More problems keep piling up. I thought it was bad enough 2 years ago, but I guess not. I know I can't do it because it would hurt my mom and friend. Being severely depressed was awful, but now I have health and financial problems on top of it. I have never wanted to do it more than I do now. How do I keep going when I know the rest of my life will be in pain? I really don't want to ruin my mom and friend."
3070,Help me,"I'm not your typical joe.
I'm an overweight teenager who recently got suspended for a misunderstanding and am truly contemplating ending my own life. Every day i just get the urge to want to beat someone to a pulp for stupid reasons amd other things are that i am so self deprecating that it makes me feel bad for me. I just want to get help from somebody but my mom doesnt have the money.

Tl/Dr rant"
3071,staring at the screen thinking about dying,
3072,Facebook makes it worse,"I didn't have that bad a day,  tried to be positive for a while. 
Now I'm sitting here scrolling through my news feed and thinking that for all these fucking friends I have no one.  Even the ones that know a little if what's going on can't be bothered.  It makes it harder to stick to my goal when everyone sees you as a worthless tramp and makes no bones about it."
3073,Why Does Every Year Get Progressively Worse?,"As a child, I was bullied for my lack of social awareness thanks to my ADD and an emotionally/physically abusive highly religious mother who concocted a poison mindset for myself. She said I didn’t need friends because “the world was going to end soon anyways” and my childhood was filled with mostly being visited at home by a psychiatrist, going to JW church, speech therapy (for a lisp), and video games. Other girls in elementary thought I was a weird girl for playing video games and anything ”boy-related” so any and all rumors of me being weird followed me into middle school and some of high school. 

Last year I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder. Last year was also rancid with the passing of my best friend (may he rest peacefully) and I was looking forward to 2019 as my year of recovery and hope.   


It’s 2019. My closest friend is now toxic and grew into habitually gaslighting, emotionally manipulating, and abusing me anytime we came to any disagreement instead of properly addressing any issue.  I have spent every breathing moment this year wondering anxiously when he would break again and result into him belittling me in such a carefully thought way. I didn’t recognize he was the problem until someone else addressed this to me. He hates when I talk to other people which led me to drift from the few friendships I have which destroyed them all.   


Worst part? He‘s an online friend and I have no real life friends anymore. I haven’t had a close real life friend in YEARS. I have become a husk that lives and breathes internet.

This led me to growing incredibly detached from people and now I’m having a hard time finding empathy in situations. I sit like a stone.   
This paired with my anorexia that pushed me to excessively exercising ALL last year (and now since I’m relapsing currently)  so I ended up becoming a hermit to socialization. Back then social events = places with food and eating. 

I’m increasingly suicidal because I lack social skills to bond with people outside of the internet. Even in my small college, I can’t relate much to my classmates either. I talk to them and feed into their conversations but because of my ADD they awkwardly cut me off because I ramble.   


I also have weird mannerisms because of my hyperactivity and childlike behavior and it’s a given that everyone thinks I’m really weird. I don‘t like to spend my time doing anything that someone my age (22 yrs) would like.. I act like such a CHILD. An actual child. Cupcakes, candy, cartoons, you name it..

I’ve been self harming in increasingly worse ways and my physical scars are a JOKE to my family. They joke about my isolation a lot (I don’t WANT to be this way, why can’t they understand) and watching my siblings ALWAYS go out with people and experience things that someone my age should be is driving me mad. 

I started getting high by myself so I could make imaginary friends and interact with them midst psychedelic trances.  

I attempted 3 days ago and once last month but obviously it didn’t work. I’m scared of how I’d be found and how much of a financial impact it would leave on my family. I WANT to. I really do want to go. If I spent 22yrs on this planet without a close friend to share an unconditional and irreplaceable bond with it’s never going to happen now. I can’t stay longer anymore. It pains to think that even in cases I have made friends they have left or have become emotionally abusive towards me.  The pain of this and other variables mentioned are so strong I don’t want to just “cope” anymore. I want to solve it once and for all.   


tl;dr Anorexic behavior + emotionally manipulative friend isolated me from keeping little friends I had. Since horrible childhood I’ve lacked social skills + only friends are online. No friends. Literally all alone. Spent my life alone, will die alone. Suicidal as fuck.  


I just want friends, man. Friends in the flesh to do everything with like the way it happens in the movies. I try to talk to people! Where am I going to find people that RELATE to me and want to know me better? The internet. Exactly. I won’t know what it’s like to go out and do anything anymore. I’m tired of everything."
3074,is there anyone to talk to,pretty much i’ve been having really bad suicidal thoughts and i’m scared to even be home alone by myself cause i’m kinda impulsive. i wanna teach out to someone. but i can’t cause of social anxiety. what do i do? even talking to my best friend about how i feel is hard cause she has a simple life a doesn’t understand.
3075,I am doing it after finals,"
I've been putting it off for the last 4 years. But growth is minimal and success is minimal as well. Almost 20 years and a sophomore in community college and I'm severely lacking in all areas. On my current track I might need an extra year to transfer, on top of that I am not enough for the Computer Science officer position in my club. The classes keep getting more frustrating and I'm lacking in every area in life. At the end of the day it's survival of the fittest, if I am not capable enough then I need to perish, sometimes I have to take things in my own hands and save myself from the future pain.

There is alot of cool stuff that I gotta experience this year. Halo Reach on PC it was awesome to play that. Avengers Endgame and also Star Wars Episode 9 when I get to watch that in a week or two. But in January after everything is settled I'm going to do it. It'll suck not being able to see the next Marvel or Star Wars movies, the avengers game, diamond and pearl remakes, Doom eternal, new smash bros characters. But that's life, sometimes you need to make the right decision in order to make it easier.

I have things I need to put in order before I do it to make this transition as smooth as possible. I need to make sure my engineering club officer is passed on to the right person. I already know this person and he would do a much better job than me compared to me now. I also need to quit my IT job so that way there is nothing disturbed with my work shifts and everything.

Once that is in place I'll go to the forest preserve near my house overdose on some OTC medication as a precaution and I'll hang myself in an isolated place. That's where my story will end."
3076,Someone from my college just posted a suicide note. Please help,"Hello,

Someone from my college just posted a suicide note on Reddit. We do not know who it is. Please, what can we do to help him? [You can find the post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sunypoly/comments/e86hew/suny_poly_suicide_date_121119/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)"
3077,Everything I do is inconsequential.,"I have no one in my life. Not even a close friend. It makes everything I do worthless. 

The only worth I have is being decent at my job and not bumming a handful of people out with my suicide. My job is unskilled (short order cook) making me easily replaceable and the only person I really care about bumming out is my Mom. 

Trying to socialize has always made me feel worse and life isn't worth living alone."
3078,a very small attempt - 12/9/19 - 6:39,"like two hours ago i thought about ending it in the bathroom. i was ready. i went under the water, but i thought about my family and just *couldn't.* now i'm just scared. i don't feel like talking to anyone so i think i'm just going to stay in my room and avoid people until i calm myself down. i want help but i don't know how to reach out, so all i can think of is attempting suicide and letting it be known that i probably need help. all i did was cut up my arms and torso a bit while i was in there. nothing to severe, but i want to do it again later tonight. it feels nice, even the sting that follows after each cut for hours. my friends make jokes about my mental health, and i just kind of laugh it off. they're always saying stuff like ""you look more depressed than usual"" or, ""you look dead, how long did you stay up last night"" but they'll say it in a mocking tone as if it's funny.

my grades are slipping and i feel abandoned. someone close to me passed away months ago and i've been in a constant state of grief and panic ever since. what's 'funny' is that whenever i found out, i was on my way to my last therapy session. i wasn't even allowed to go to the fucking funeral. no last goodbyes, no more memories, and no more evening conversations. i miss her. so fucking much."
3079,Goodbye letter,"I am a 20 year old who had a trauma filled childhood. Despite an awful upbringing, I have managed to face each day with a smile! I have become the light in many peoples lives, always have been a shoulder to cry on, and someone who can make you laugh effortlessly. There is one person in my life right now who knows of the awful demons I battle here, and there. I made a suicide attempt at age 12, and was unsuccessful. I have amazing people in my life but I am so tired... these nights come in waves. I am beyond depressed tonight, so much so that I wrote my goodbye letter. I don’t know what to do anymore, my depression gets worse with each wave"
3080,Best way to kill yourself,"Hey guys! I've thought about this for 17 years and I am really determined to kill myself. From all the pains I've been through, what's harmless dying? I wanted to die without mending too much pain. Maybe die while sleeping or such, any recommendation?"

3083,"I'm really considering suicide right now, i'm too scared to ask for help.",I'm just sitting in the bath with a knife reliving my suicide attempt over and over. I tried talking to one of my friends but he doesn't care.. I'm scared if i tell someone they will think i'm an attention seeker or that they will freak out bad. I feel so alone and isolated and i feel like i'm loosing touch with reality. I'm in a trance and it's getting harder to break out of it. The only thing i can hear are all the bad voices spiraling in my head. I want to have quiet. I want to feel ok again. I don't want to feel this way anymore. Things aren't going to get better.
3084,Don't know how I'm going to be able to live with myself after this,"For starters, this is a throwaway. I have no idea where to post but one of my really close friends knows my actual reddit account and I really just don't want this stuff to be linked to it either. I'm really sorry if I'm breaking any rules. 

I have a lot of problems with imposter syndrome which I'll kind of get into in this post, but I'd like to add that I've not been diagnosed with any sort of mental or psychological order. I'm unable to get help with this because every time I ask my parents I am told that I am either 'faking it', 'it's not that bad' or 'it will ruin my reputation'. So yeah. :(

I've always sort of passively ideated suicide- like, I'm super terrified of death, but it's always sort of been on the back burner there as a possible option... you know, of all else fails...

I'm 14 years old. I'm a former gifted kid. The problem is, where I live there are these 'continuation' programs that are very promising for students in terms of academic success. I'm currently in the middle level of this program, in the final year. I know I have no concept of failure(as I have been told by my parents) and feel ""entitled"" to be able to continue to the next level. I put way too much pressure on myself to get perfect grades and still barely pull a's in my weak subjects. I know I got into the middle level because I did preparation and a lot of the test was VERY similar to the prep. I do terrible in math... I've gotten F's and D's on super easy tests, even when the teacher tells the class that the grades were mostly a's and b's. I still get a's as my overall grade, but I know my math teachers probably consider me a weak student. I'm so scared they're going to be the reason I won't get into the high school level program.

I don't feel prepared for the test, which is on wednesday. I know I've studied endlessly, and I'm probably going to do very well on the math and verbal parts(I've been studying the math part excessively, and I have a generally large vocabulary). However, I'm really scared because there's a nonverbal part as well, which I'm SUPER BAD at. I KNOW I'm going to get so many wrong on that. Some of my friends have already taken the test and told me it was easier than they expected, but I spoke to sone high school level students who said the same thing, and they typically missed around 12 questions per section. That terrifies me. I know I have to do well on this test. And even if it's that easy, how could they have gotten that many wrong? I know they still got in, but they're generally strong students who do math competitions, etc. I've done 2 math competitions and failed both of them because I'm terrible at math. I also know that my application was terrible and my teacher recommendations should be ok, but I'm really scared about the one from my math teacher because I know she thinks I'm stupid.

I can't fail this test. Everything I've done since starting in the early years program has been culminating to this. If I don't get in, it will have been years wasted, and the only other kids who wont get in are people who don't care. I've been stressing myself out about this to the point of throwing up several times. I keep fearing I'm gonna wake up on test day with a headache. I can't JUST pass. I have to get 99th percentile on the test to get in. I don't think I can pull that. I'm good enough, but not THAT good.

If I don't get into the program, I can't go on living like this. I'm going to end my life. I can't be known as the ""girl who failed"". everyone tells me I'm so smart, but I know I'm not smart enough. There are some seriously smart, gifted kids in this program who have gotten this far because they're actually smart. I'm here because I have strict parents and too-high standards for myself.

I don't know how I'm going to go about it- my plan right now has been to kick out the screen of my window and jump out. However, I'm scared it's not high enough and I'm gonna end up disabled and living an even worse life than I would if I were dead. While I'm absolutely terrified of death, of the void, of not living, I know I will have to do it.

I know I'm entitled. I know I don't know real pain. I know my problems are stupid.

But if I don't have this I won't have anything. I've given up everything- sports, extracurriculars- academics are all I have. If I fail the test, I won't have anything to live for. I won't be able to live with myself knowing it could've been different if I had only gotten one more question right. I won't be able to handle it.

I've been having nervous breakdowns since last year over this. It might not be for other people, who walk in and effortlessly pass and really don't give a shit whether they get in or not, but this test is life or death for me, and I really don't want to die, but I'm going to have to if I make a stupid fucking slip-up on it. My life rests on this fucking test, and I just can't handle it.

My parents have been semi-supportive. I know I might have given you a bad impression of them at the beginning, but they're really not bad- my mom has a lot of biases and stuff that I can't shake from her, but she's still been really supportive. i haven't told her of my plans to commit suicide, but she knows how important this test is and she's been helping me prepare. I just can't confide in them about this because they'll blow their tops, but otherwise they've been great and I'll be really sad not to have them anymore after I die. Not to have this life anymore. While I'd prefer it if life were a little better, and I know my problems are really stupid first-world problems, I still like my life(somewhat) and I know my family and friends can be toxic sometimes and aren't the best fit for me but they can also be really great and nice and supportive and funny- They just won't be able to handle it if I told them the truth. They won't be able to see me as the person I've been trying to paint a picture of for so long.

I need somewhere to vent. I'm so sorry. I just can't handle it anymore. I'm crying as I type this. I know my problems aren't bad enough for anyone to really care, and that I'll make a lot of people with real problems mad because I'm some stupid fucking teenager who can't even handle getting a b in a class because I've never been exposed to real failure, but I just... needed somewhere to type this. to get it out of my system. not just in a fucking diary like everyone tells me to. I need it to be out there in the world for someone to see it, and I don't care what they think of me and my stupid problems. I'm sick of being me and wish I never started being the way I am, because it's too fucking HARD and I can't do it. I can't handle it, and I have nothing to fall back on.

Fuck. I just want to die. I want to die, but not REALLY DIE- I don't want to never feel things again. As of now, it's just been a funny, off-handed ironic remark that I would throw around. Now it might be my only option, and I want to go home."
3085,Finding a suicide method was comforting (and me rambling),"For some reason, when I found a definite painless and fool-proof suicide method I felt sort of relieved. If anyone's curious, it's inert gas asphyxiation. It was surprising actually that it took me so long to find such a simple and subtle method. Maybe it's not talked about since it's so appealing haha.

Realising that I can kill myself so easily anytime I want was comforting and I think it's because I can keep on failing as always but it doesn't lead to anything amymore. I can just stop feeling.

I might never get to do my second semester of university if I go through with it. I guess what's stopping me still are mainly two things.

First, I have this crazy and impossible hope that I'll still succeed in everything, even my exams that are this week that I haven't studied for. I am delusional and think I'm special and things will turn out perfect I think. Then again, I'm sort of not studying so that I can fail and get more fuel to kill myself. Why is it that I know the solutions to my problems, yet refuse to ve happy and orefer staying miserable? I think it's becuase I'm so lazy and it's easier. 

The second reason I'm stilla live is because I don't want to hurt the few people who associate with me. I'm avoiding further and new contact to prevent more damage, but I'll still hurt people I think. I guess as a sort of solution I thought of was to talk about my suicide to the people I think care about me and have them say their statements and make peace with my decision. I think that's much better than any parting message or suicide letter I'll ever make.

Probably very obvious by now, but this is just me typing in a stream of consciousness way. I think I'm lonely. I want to cry. I'm just rambling in hopes of something happening I think. I'm not sure what I want happen.

For the curious, I did go into a counselling session two months ago because it was offered by the university. He said there would be a follow-up, so I was hopeful I guess... Two months passed and here I am, still without help. I think I want help. I have thoughts that I think need sorting and renewal. I don't want to think he lied, but I wish I had gotten an update or something...

Well I'll just end this for now saying that if I'm still kicking, I think I'd love to answer any questions or respond to stuff. I think that I sort of made this post to spread the method and maybe find people similar to me.

Thank you for reading. I'm not used to expressing these feelings in any way, so I think this was nice. Oh I do have a question I just remembered: how does my idea of offering peace with my death to people while I'm still alive by confronting them sound? Okay, goodbye for real this time. Again, thank you."
3086,I will not live alone,"Nothing is worth it, I can't feel. 
I have spent the last 3 days in a daze 
Sleeping the entirety of the weekend.
I wanted to see people 
I just feel very alone 
I am alone with people
I can't be with people 
I'm alone 
I can't stand it 

I dream of killing myself 
Grabbing some vodka 
driving up too a mountain 
And jumping off 

I just can't stand it anymore"
3087,I've made the decision to end my life 2 years from now,"I discussed this with my mother and she thinks if it's what i truly need to do then she will support me seeking a painless way to go.

I genuinely don't wish to live as this disgusting, pathetic piece of trash that i am right now who stumbles and stutters through conversations afraid of people. I'm essentially Jerry Smith and i can't live life without a backbone it's too painful.

I can't hold a job for +6 months without becoming miserable. I have no hobbies except gaming which makes me feel useless and antisocial, i can't be intimate with a partner because well when i get to the task i'm so nervous it doesn't even work, i'm not sure of my sexuality, every time i go to my therapist i leave angrier, i have very few friends whom i never see, and i rarely see my family, to top it all off everyone sees through me and largely walks on me because i'm spineless.

So based on all of the above and the general lack of feeling i have day to day (what i mean to say is i feel mentally numb) i've decided if in 2 years i can't change this around i'm just going to end my life on my birthday. This isn't the first time i've wanted to do this and i'm starting to think if these feelings reoccur so often maybe it's the right thing to do. 

I just can't find my place in this world, i wish i could connect with people on a deeper level but i can't and being afraid all the time is so draining.

I'll treat myself like a terminally ill individual and start trying to do things with my life/money until the due date. My hope is obviously i'll turn things around so yes this is another glorified cry for help if you want to look at it that way but personally i feel i'm finally going to do what i want and stop following the bs we hear everywhere about how wonderful life is. 

Life's shit and people make it even shitter so fuck them, fuck this world, and fuck everyone who tells me that it's wrong to end it. It's my choice, it's my body the least you can do is let me die painlessly and with dignity."
3088,"Im 17. If my life doesnt get better by the time i turn 18 or next year, im gonna shoot myself.",Im not gonna explain my problems because yall see a lot of that here already. Basically what the title says. Im just tired man
3089,"Thanks for downvoting my post, I'm out",
3090,I don’t owe it to anyone,"My family, my boyfriend, my friends. They’re all selfish fucks who want me to stay on this world just for the sake of saving them from pain but what about me? What about my pain? I’m a broken piece of shit and I always will be and I don’t need to stay alive just because other people want me to. I never asked to be born and I want a refund"
3091,I told my boyfriend I’m having suicidal thoughts. It didn’t really help much.,"I told him. He’s the only person who knows I feel suicidal again after years of feeling better. I know
I’m too much of a chicken to actually commit suicide, and I’ve had a friend commit suicide before so I know how painful it is to people. But I just can’t help but feel like I have no purpose. What the fuck at I supposed to do with my life. The only thing I’m really happy about is that I actually have my boyfriend, because he’s the only one that really listens to me. 

So I told him I’m thinking suicidal thoughts again. He says he feels sad too, but not to the extent I do. I wanna work through it together with him but I feel like such a fucking burden. I’m always so sad. I’m not a good girlfriend. You’re supposed to love yourself first but I can’t even look at myself in the mirror without thinking I’m the ugliest person alive. I feel like he’s the only reason I’m not actually ending it all. That and I’m too much of a fucking coward to go through with it. 

I don’t wanna break up with him but I just feel like such a horrible person putting him through my bullshit. I literally don’t know what to fucking do at this point."
3092,I’m on and off about going through with killing myself.,"I’m indecisive. I’m so stressed. My girlfriend is being abused and I can’t stand it anymore. I’m poor, I never get things I need on time. My poor parents stress themselves out every day so we can barely pay rent. I’ve wanted to kill myself for such a long time now. I’m so sick and tired of everyone stepping on me or just blatantly ignoring me, or just seeing me as a burden. I’m useless. I come home from school, eat, sleep, repeat. I have anxiety medication and I can easily overdose. I just don’t want to hurt my brother or my girlfriend any more then they’ve already been hurt. I’m so indecisive. I need to make up my mind. But I’m scared. I fucking hate myself."
3093,i fear the unknown,"i hope this is the last thing i ever write.

i promise all of you i'm a piece of shit so before you start trying to prevent me from doing this hear me out.

i have lost everything in the matter of months. my parents hate me, i get tormented at school by people who are supposed to be my friends, my girlfriend would rather get drunk and black out then tell me she loves me when i need it the most. i'm 16, i shouldn't feel this way but i do. so i spent my time writing music. music doesn't help me anymore. i've tried to cope with the everlasting anguish i feel but nothing ever helps. things never get better. i have sat here and listened to every psychologist's advice yet nothing ever changes. the problem is me. i cannot fix who i am. i don't know how to start. i feel like im not able to be fixed. i am not afraid of death, i am afraid of what happens next. i sincerely hope reincarnation does not exist because i feel genuine pity for every living thing on this planet. we are all living our lives until the day comes where we don't, and nothing in life truly matters after that. if we are all going to die anyways, why are am i still here? for memories that never stay because people eventually get tired of me and leave?

my parents don't care. my parents want a good heterosexual who will do good in school and be very religious and that is not who i am. they have belittled me and beat me into thinking this is the only way to live. my girlfriend is battling substance abuse issues and i feel like shit for not being able to be there for her. all we do is fight. i don't know how to tell her i love her. i don't know how to say goodbye. i can't keep friends. i think i'm just not meant to interact with people. everyone has a problem with me.

i feel as if my walls are caving in. i'm sorry to those who will read this and feel pity, i'm sorry for those like me who cannot find happiness. 

if i don't end it tonight, i will definitely do it this month or next month. i genuinely cannot do this anymore."
3094,help me out,"

 i have told myself since i was 10 or 11 that i would kill myself before my 17th birthday. 

i am now at the point where it is just over a month away and i lack the want to move foreword. 

i can’t even think about sorting out a job in the city i am moving to later this month because i don’t think i will live until then. 

suicide isn’t a sad or scary thing; 

it feels more like a thing that will happen to me when i am ready for it to and the time is right. 

the only time i ever feel alive is when i’m about to kill myself, it’s the only adrenaline rush i feel that excites me. 

i lie to everyone on how i feel to comfort them, to let them think i feel how they were hoping i would.  

i was mentally hurt by a lover to extents i could never even imagine, sometimes feeling like it would be better if they just physically abused me so i would at least have proof.

i feel like that made the broken building crumble. 

i pretend people aren’t who they really are to comfort myself. 

pretend that i am loved by at least someone in this world. 

my time here is a ticking time bomb. 

i take my noose everywhere like a pet. 

maybe you will think that i am silly. 

i wouldn’t be here right now if my chandelier wasn’t so close to the ground. 

this isn’t a sad thing for me i’m not sad writing this. 

i’m over the sad stage of suicidal. 
i am just at the ready point. 

i just don’t want to live my life in constant fear. what do i do reddit?"
3095,Does anyone else feel as broken and miserable as me?,"
I could not feel anymore alone than I do right now in life. I’ve been dealt a really bad card. I have no friends, never had a boyfriend and my family has done me dirty. I don’t know what I have done to make people hate me in my life, I’ve encountered drama with a lot of people, in work and school etc. I’m not hideous or mean, I take good care of myself. I’ve tried to be friendly but only end up being treated unfairly. Everyone I know has family and people that care about them, my family is filled with backstabbers and shady people that only want to gossip. I’m 25 and have no one, I felt so lonely that I ended up adopting a dog. The dog is clingy and has separation anxiety. I feel like there’s something wrong with everyone around me, not even men find me attractive. I never get attention from men, do I sound like the issue?"
3096,Why not just end it now?,"I’ve been thinking about it since I was 11, and it hasn’t left my mind since. I’m not a cliche suicidal kid. I don’t slit my wrists, I’m popular in school, I’m funny, I’m somewhat athletic but the feeling won’t leave. My family has a long history of suicide and self harm, for example, my aunt who was basically my mom, killed herself two months ago. I know life is tough, and I know you are supposed to “stay strong”, but every waking fucking second is miserable. My immediate family is verbally and mentally abusive. I get shit on every day of my life. I’ve always been the popular, act out kid, but there’s another side. I go home and hack. Everybody. Though I don’t do anything to anybody with the knowledge I have, I do know what’s behind the mask everyone is always wearing, and it’s fucking sick. This world is a terrible, shitty place, and in the end, we will all die. And in the end, the universe we eventually end, and nothing anybody ever did or ever will do will ever matter. So what the fuck is the point? I really, really want to change the world one day, but I don’t have the fucking will power do it. My step mother goes through my room, every day whenever I’m not home. Every single inch is checked. There is a new rule every day and I fucking hate it. My dad used to be AWESOME, but my step mothers misery puts him down and in a shitty mood every day. They fight all the time, then when they get mad, they take it out on me, and there is nobody there to back me up along the way. I have nobody I can talk to. I garuntee nobody even read this whole thing, but that’s okay. That will just prove my point even more, that we are all insignificant cockroaches that have the attention span of a gold fish. I’m thinking about it everyone. I’m going out like Robin Williams. Peace."
3097,I am doing it after finals," 

I've been putting it off for the last 4 years. But growth is minimal and success is minimal as well. Almost 20 years and a sophomore in community college and I'm severely lacking in all areas. On my current track I might need an extra year to transfer, on top of that I am not enough for the Computer Science officer position in my club. The classes keep getting more frustrating and I'm lacking in every area in life. At the end of the day it's survival of the fittest, if I am not capable enough then I need to perish, sometimes I have to take things in my own hands and save myself from the future pain.

There is alot of cool stuff that I gotta experience this year. Halo Reach on PC it was awesome to play that. Avengers Endgame and also Star Wars Episode 9 when I get to watch that in a week or two. But in January after everything is settled I'm going to do it. It'll suck not being able to see the next Marvel or Star Wars movies, the avengers game, diamond and pearl remakes, Doom eternal, new smash bros characters. But that's life, sometimes you need to make the right decision in order to make it easier.

I have things I need to put in order before I do it to make this transition as smooth as possible. I need to make sure my engineering club officer is passed on to the right person. I already know this person and he would do a much better job than me compared to me now. I also need to quit my IT job so that way there is nothing disturbed with my work shifts and everything.

Once that is in place I'll go to the forest preserve near my house overdose on some OTC medication as a precaution and I'll hang myself in an isolated place. That's where my story will end."

3099,Decade mark,"Howdy Y'all

I wrote this nice passage for my future auto fucking biography in the text box before tossing it and going back to watching the football game.  Then I started thinking again (Hate when I do that) and felt like posting.

Its been 10 years since my attempt of suicide today and it means a lot to me.  I was 15, a juvenile, my mom had just been sent to jail a week ago and i was home alone and up to delinquent shit anyway.  Delinquent shit as in taking my entire adhd medicine(vyvanse) script and going through eventual sleep deprivation psychosis and on December 9th, 2009 found me on the floor in my crawlspace with multiple self inflicted wounds to the head.

I have a history of reckless behaviors, an anthology of stories and will continue to walk the line with chaos..  but I'm doing leaps and bounds better these days and choose to let my heart flow a lot more.

I did want to say to everyone, you all have a story and it is so wonderful to hear.  Life and what we go through may be so terribly hard.. it drives us to insane measures.  Doing things and experiencing hardships we would wish upon no one.  Letting the most dark and cruel shit fester and impact our world..

Yet were still here.  There is still an abundance of good to be reaped from around you.  There is tons and tons of love that hasnt been recognized.  A level of passion unparalleled to much else, thats uniquely yours!  What a beautiful thing amidst a great struggle.

Well youre just that, a beautiful person in a temporary struggle.  You got this!  Youre loved and cherished!  ❤❤❤

Im so glad to be here with you all"
3100,Signs,"Struggling here. I put this together-as I just feel silent in my struggle. 

How Suicidal Ideation Looks From The Outside:

To close friends-
A lot of talk about how bad things are. Eventually days turn into weeks of no contact at all. Waits to see if a text will come through to them-vs- FROM them (as it usually is).

To other friends:
Generally look ok, but may acknowledge some struggle. May seem distant. May see swollen eyes from crying. 

To family: If theres anyone in the family they trust- the truth has been told. Told again. Eventually person stops telling. Becomes distant. Cries easily-for seemingly trivial issues.

To employer:
Same ole same ole. Perfection. Hard on self. But weird ""all of a sudden"" changes in schedule. May have swollen eyes from crying.

To social media:
Total disappearance. Person is wondering if anyone will ""notice"" or care. 

To adult children:
May witness parent cries easily and often. Erratic emotions.  Distance. Erratic communication."

There’s no point. i’m a burden to everyone and many people already say i’m a nobody and i should do the world a favor and off myself. maybe i should listen to them, atleast make someone proud. i am a failure and i can’t do anything right and i can’t help anyone. i’ve tried to commit suicide many times in the past. i can’t even do the simplest of things, all my attempts failed. no one truly knows how i feel. people i trust and family know i have depression and have tried to kill myself once but not about the other attempts. they don’t know about my self harm either. i should just remove myself from the world. i’m not good enough. why am i even typing this. i might commit suicide tonight and i’ll make sure it works this time. i’m sorry"

i need to get out of this fucking city and away from most of these fucking people as soon as humanly possible or else i don't think i will be here much longer. i've experienced too much trauma in my life and i still have to meet face to face with many of the people who did it to me rgularly i just want to get out of here before its too late for me

i'm currently making plans to move to delaware sometime next year and every time i tell anyone close to me they try and convince me to stay here in my home state. i don't think these people understand that if i don't get out of here soon enough i WILL kill myself"

3110,Vomiting blood and I can’t stop drinking.,"I’ve posted in other subreddits but I guess I’m just typing into the void.

I’ve been bulimic for years. Mentally ill for many more. Tonight, I purged and vomited blood. And an hour later I’m still spitting up blood. Every google search and ounce of common sense is telling me to go to the hospital. But I have no health insurance, no money, and I can’t afford the debt. It’s not as simple as “Just go to the hospital and worry about the bill later”. I’m already a burden in every sense

So, as someone who’s attempted suicide many times, I’m just continuing to drink and spit up blood and hoping I’ll pass out soon. Knowing my luck, it won’t kill me and I’ll just wake up from another melodramatic night. But whatever."
3111,I like the feeling of death,"Well, I’ve never told the internet about this kinda stuff before, and I’m quite apprehensive to even write this, but I’ll give it a shot. I have wanted to kill myself for quite some time now. I just cannot seem to find any easy way out of my problems. I cannot seem to ever do my homework, and when I do do it it’s always in late. I’m getting lower than normal grades, and that’s just not acceptable. I just don’t care anymore. But the really weird thing is, I kinda like the feeling. I embrace death with open arms. I was on some antidepressants and I believe that that helped fuel my suicidal thoughts. I talked with a few people, including my parents, about this and I still cannot seem to shake the feeling. I don’t know why. I am not scared of dying, but I am scared about dying painfully. I want to die, but I just cannot bring myself to do it. I guess I’ll end this blurb about my unimportant life here before I regret it. -Dragon3488"

3114,"(EXTREMELY SERIOUS!) Atheist Attempts Suicide, Finds Himself Falling Down A Dark Tunnel, Is Rescued By God &amp; Shows His Gratitude By Making A Deal With The Devil. (This Is Not The Onion!)","I had to hold back on my [first testimony](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/e8c60c/jesus_set_me_free_from_ssa_and_he_is_willing_and/) but I now see that I would have done many people a great disservice.

When    I was 18, I overdosed on diazepam in an attempt to end my life. As an    athesist, I thought that life would cease and all my suffering would    end. What happened was completely different: I found myself falling  down   a tunnel at tremendous velocity. The only light in the    darker-than-the-deepest-black tunnel was that of the quickly receding    physical world around me. Instead of panicking, I embraced my doom    because I was so deceived, yet in such despair: I was finally going to    hell - where I thought I belonged. \[I cannot explain it, but when I  left   my body, I knew and understood everything that was happening. I  knew   where I was going, why I was there, etc.\] Then I began to see a  small   flicker of light at the bottom of the tunnel and I understood  that I was   staring into the mouth of hell and a severe dread, panic  and regret   gripped me but I told myself that I would never beg God for  anything.    All of a sudden, there was a light and two angels picked  me up. *Was I joyful that I was not going to hell?*    Of course not! Whilst being lifted up, I told God how much I hated  Him   and that I would not follow Him. When I woke up - a miracle   considering  that I had taken a megadose - I was angry with God for   rescuing me. ""Why  had He interfered with my plans? Why did this   totalitarian despot  prevented me from freeing myself from Him?"" He   immediately responded  with, ""Because I love you"" and I became even more   angry!

I  finally realised that I   could hurt God by doing the opposite of what He  wanted me to do. I  now  understood that He Ioved me and did not want me  to go to hell, so I   did what any demonised teenager would do: I made a  pact with the  devil  knowing fully that that would absolutely break   God's heart. I  could  astral project without any effort, and I made a  deal whose   specificities I shall not be sharing. On top of that, I  continued to   plot my own death - despite having been saved from hell -  for the next   two months and refused to repent until that one fateful day  that was   ordained before the foundation of the universe: the day that I  met   Jesus.

If there is someone    considering suicide, let me tell you that dying without Christ will not    give you rest! It is only the beginning of eternal sorrows and there  is   no hope! I implore you to give your burdens to Jesus because He  truly   cares for you and will give you rest!

[u/Agnostics](https://www.reddit.com/u/Agnostics/)/@Atheists:    As someone who was an atheist, (read: angry theist) my lack of belief    in the existence of God, heaven, hell, angels and demons did NOT  negate   the fact that they DO exist and that my attempted suicide  landed me on   the road there. Please do not end your lives. Humble  yourselves and  come  to Jesus Christ!

I have tried to get help, nobody will listen. Nobody gives a fuck. What is the point of this??"
3116,What particular place should I aim to ensure that I die and don't become physically disabled or anything?,"Hello! I know it's kind of a dumb question but those stories of people with permanent disfigurement/disability kind of freak me out, althought my dad's handgun is really my only good method of suicide (other than maybe sleeping pills? but thats a bit too slow for me) 

I just want to make sure that the job's done quickly cause I'd rather not live with a disfigured face for the rest of my life. Thanks for reading."
3117,I'm 16 and I don't want to live anymore.,"I've never posted online about how I want to die before so i  don't exactly know how to phrase this so I'm sorry if I screw this up or anything. I don't necessarily want to die, more like I just don't want to live anymore.

 I'm just tired of everything all the time. I've lost interest in everything around me and it all feels pointless. I just keep remembering that my life is pointless and meaningless. I know that when I grow up I'll just be more miserable since I have nothing to live for. I just want to end it early, now. I know it will make my parents and my family sad but I just don't want to do it anymore. 

I don't think I have depression, since I've always felt like this, and I don't want to kill myself out of sadness or anything. I wanted to end it before my drivers test, but that's tomorrow so it's a little late. I don't even enjoy driving even though most people my age do. 

I'm basically worthless, I have no life goals, I suck at everything, and I'm a nervous wreck. I feel the main reason I'm posting is because I view suicide as my best option but I'm looking for any advice before I try to commit. Since you can't come back from being dead. I'm very sorry for rambling, like I said first post like this, but thanks for reading."

3124,My life has been steadily collapsing since 2017. Now? I'm almost over the edge.,"Earlier today, I received news that I have been removed from a course because of the fact I had missed my deadline by 2 hours. My father paid almost £3,000 for this course, and I still haven't had the courage to tell him. Upon hearing this news, I had probably one of the worst panic attacks that I've ever had. This is what's pushing me over the edge. I never particularly enjoyed the course, but I would usually always do the bare minimum. Now that I don't have this, I don't have anything. 

I'm 18, almost 19. I was taken out of high school in my last year because of personal problems, where me and my family moved to Finland, where I've been for the past year. In 2018 I barely passed any of my A-Level mock exams. I pretty much failed them. I wasn't worried about it, and told myself I'd do better for the real thing. This is where everything started to collapse. That summer, I did nothing but spend 18+ hours on my computer, everyday, for 2 months. I'd been suicidal before, for this exact reason. Come November, and I'm told I have to drop everything, and move to Finland. I have nothing here. I have no friends, I have no education, I have no job, I have literally nothing. My parents are on holiday right now, and I'm home alone. I have no one I could call, no one to be with me, if I killed myself, I wouldn't be found for a week or two. I feel incredibly guilty, and that feeling is already worsened by the fact that there are christmas presents under our christmas tree for me. I've felt suicidal before but never as much as I feel now. Everything feels like it'll be solved by just ending it, because I have nothing to live for anymore. I'm sitting here crying into my pillow as I try to type this, I don't know what to do."
3125,Question,How do I tell my parents I need to go to the hospital? I'm trying to ask them but then they'll get mad at me and I don't know how to handle that right now.
3126,I see no way out.,"I’m a teenager. I can’t move out of my house because I don’t make enough money, let alone going through all of the court processes to get emancipated from my abusive father. 

My sister has to do all the chores in the house, she is sick with anemia and is frequently tired. My dad pushes every responsibility onto her, and his standards are high enough where even if she does clean everything, it’s just not enough. He used to do this to me, but I started working four days a week and that quickly became “yeah, I’ll just make her do it.” 

Today she was crying at the dinner table and he kept telling her to stop, just stop crying. He said he didn’t care about how she felt, because she “cries about literally everything.” I told him he is a horrible parent for sitting there and doing nothing, and he grabbed me by my arm to take me out of the kitchen. Telling me to fuck off, and how I should respect him. He demands things I paid for. He is holding a car that I never asked for and Christmas presents over my head. Over my sisters heads as well. All my dad does is yell and scream at us, telling us about how he doesn’t care. He is emotionally unavailable, and he only cares about himself. When I tell him I feel this way, he gets angry and tells me that I don’t treat him right and how he deserves an apology. My dad smokes and drinks in the house. Invites his adult male friends over. Wasted all his money online gambling. Has no college fund or anything. I live an unusual life. 

I want to kill myself, let alone the fact that my sister probably does too. We’re both depressed, sick, mentally ill etc. I feel like it’s never going to get better. It never gets better. I was in an abusive relationship a few years ago and everyone told me it would just get better but it doesn’t. Life is a recurring cycle of shit for me and I don’t know why. I very much believe in if you’re nice you receive good karma and vice versa. I try to be a positive source for people but it’s so hard because I feel like the world is out to get me. I have no options. I can’t move out because I don’t make enough money, and I can’t even get extra hours because they have none available. I’m doing mediocre in school, and every-time I’m at home for a full day I’m accompanied by my dad. I just feel like it never gets better. 

I don’t have a mom, I don’t have any extended family besides my dads but I don’t feel safe with them. My boyfriends parents won’t let me move in for reasonable and obvious reasoning. I feel like suicide is my only way out. I would call CAS, but I don’t want to get separated from my siblings, and whenever they are here as they’ve been called before, we get told to lie and/or dad lies himself. 

The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because I believe in the fact that suicide is the only sin you cannot be forgiven for. If I wasn’t worried about sinning against God I would’ve done it already. I don’t know what to do, I feel stuck and I feel like killing myself is the only way out. That if I did this maybe people would learn to care about each-other more."
3127,I don't think I can take much more,"My depression has been spiralling. My physical health has fucked up my body and my life. Even though it has been improving, I've completely lost myself in the process. I am a shell of the person I used to be and I just don't want to keep going.
I was completely detached from emotion for a while. I had a tough therapy session today and am now filled with despair and sadness.
Up to now, knowing I had a suicide plan was enough to calm me down. Now I feel like I need to implement it. I just cannot keep going."
3128,anyone else feel like they wasted their childhood,I’ve been cutting myself since I was 10 and now im a senior in high school and i feel like I haven’t had a day since then where I haven’t thought about killing or hurting myself. Im failing school and I don’t want to graduate. and I have no idea what I want to do now because I spent all of my developmental years hating myself and how I looked and wanting to die. I feel like I wasted so much time being depressed instead of being a kid and I’ll never get to go back and that if I make it to adulthood that looking back ill feel nothing but regret like now I wish I could have a second chance and enjoy being a kid
3131,my boyfriend and i have been fighting a lot lately.,he’s one of the only reasons im still alive today. if we break up i think i’m going to go through with my plan. i don’t think we will but lately we have been fighting constantly. i just needed to vent.
3134,The thoughts are coming back really strong don't know if I can stop myself,
3135,How can I go to sleep and never wake up.,"Im in a life loop everything is just repeating. And its progressively getting worse. I've tried everything I know to do. 
Talk to people. I've moved. I've tried leaving my family because of the past trauma. sexual abuse, verbal, physical, emotional abuse. 
I moved back with the family after years of doing life on my own and dealing with death of friends and boyfriend's, and drug and alcohol problems.
I've lost over 40lbs from not eating. I can't afford food and I'm honestly not even hungry anymore. 
I'm honestly so tired. I've tried. I just mess up and hurt everyone. I want to go to sleep and not wake up. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I don't want to know theres a bunch of years ahead where this is just gonna continue being a problem.
Help me go to sleep. And just not wake up."
3136,Why is it so hard to die,I took the bottle of bleach and shook it. Noting that it had a quarter left I decided it wasn’t nearly enough to be fatal. This caused me to have a panic attack bc I couldn’t set out to do what I wanted. finally i took a sip just to see and it tasted awful and immediately spit it out and now my throat burns and i feel like I have to keep clearing it. Why is it so hard to die
3137,My friend only interacts with me when she is drunk and threatening suicide.,"I have a friend who I've been best friends with almost all my life. We used to be inseparable until she moved away when we were in middle school. Since then, we've seen each other infrequently but it's always like picking up where we left off. She is like a sister to me, and is a second daughter to my parents, who also love her dearly.

She has dealt with more shit than anyone should in life - abuse, drug addiction, alcoholism, she's abused and been the abuser in romantic relationships, just a terrible hand at times. In the last year or so, she has gone through more hardship - robbers breaking in, a bad breakup, losing a job, trying to get sober. Every time something has happened, she has called me, slurring and incoherent, begging me to give her permission to kill herself. I talk to her, and I try to let her feel heard and offer advice and empathy, but I really don't feel equipped to help. The calls usually devolve into her yelling at me about how my life is perfect (far from it: I've battle/d my own mental health demons and have worked hard to stay healthy) and how I couldn't possibly understand, please let her go, she wants it all to end.

For the past 2-3 years, she has not texted or called me besides to have a 1+ hour phone call of me talking her down from committing suicide. I've tried to have a relationship with her besides being her emotional support, but she doesn't talk to me when things go well. I feel drained by the relationship and feel like it's totally one-sided. She never asks how I am on the calls, even. And how I am is totally wrecked after every call.

I've contacted her parents for episodes in the past, but they are nearing the end of their rope due to her verbal abuse when she drinks. I've also given her the suicide hotline number and encouraged her to stay sober, practice self care, and talk to a therapist. But what else should I be doing? I just can't field these calls forever for the sake of my own mental health. She just called me tonight and I know I'll be dealing with the aftermath in my emotional health and continuing the conversation with her. I don't know what else I should do. It's so hard to listen to someone you love say ""let me go, please let me go"" while sobbing.

TL;DR: My childhood friend only calls me when she is drunk and incoherent, threatening suicide and begging me to let her go. I don't have the mental fortitude to keep taking these calls. What else should I do?"
3138,I took a bunch of Tylenol earlier today.,"So I took a bunch of Tylenol earlier today, probably upwards of 20 of the extra strength pills.  I really need help, I don't know what to do.  I know I need to go to the hospital but I'm scared of what's going to happen, I'm scared I'm really going to upset my father.  I've been to the psych ward for suicidal thoughts before and they sent me to child protection because I wasn't safe to go home and I'm scared that will happen again.  I know that I'm going to do severe damage to my liver if I don't go get treatment at the hospital but I'm really scared.  It hasn't even been 10 hours since I took the pills and I already feel nauseous, it's probably all the fear I'm feeling.  I really don't know what to do.  I might just go to school tomorrow and ask them to call me an ambulance but I'm really scared.  What should I do?"
3139,Chronic health condition made me suicidal,"I've always had the short end of the stick in life. I was always pretty unfortunate looking back at my life. I'm pretty ugly, I had terrible acne for years and now just a poor complexion, I have social anxiety and no friends, I'm depressed, my gf of 7 years dumped me, and I'm very behind in life for someone my age(21). I have asthma and sinusitis.

I know what a lot of people might be thinking: ""oh asthma isnt that bad a lot of people have it."" Yeah it's not a big deal if its mild. My asthma has been getting progressively worse these last couple years and this last year it went from mild/intermediate to severe. I'm always short of breath. I haven't taken a deep breath in 8 months. I'm failing out of college because I cant focus in school because of all the discomfort. My meds are basically just keeping me alive at this point they don't alleviate my symptoms they just prevent full blown attacks. On top of that my nose has been almost 100% stuffed for 2 years. I'm miserable. I get maybe 4 hours of actual sleep a night. I almost always feel like I'm suffocating. I feel like an old man but I'm only 21. Every other guy in my college town is having the time of their lives in their prime running around and screaming going to parties every weekend. I can't do any of that.

My mom is amazing and would do anything for me but she selfishly gave me her asthma. She grew up in and out of hospitals because of her asthma and the first thing she thought after getting married was  ""let's pass my burden onto someone else and ruin their life."" Despite everything else life did to torment me I had a good normal childhood and I'm thankful for that. But now things are bad and they wont get any better only worse. I wish I knew my life was doomed from the start earlier. Only a year ago I was so optimistic about my future I was a very active person and loved lifting weights so much I'd lift 5 days a week and started building more musscle. I was going to move on with my life and fix all my past mistakes and things I put on myself like my anxiety. But now something that is completely out of my control crept up on me and destroyed my life. I just lay around on my phone all day long and cant get myself to do anything else.

I gained 25 pounds and shower maybe 2 times a week. I'm so envious of people who have the chance at a normal happy life. Mental illness is real but even  people who are depressed can make it out okay. Bad things happen to other people but not like how they happen to me. Someones dog dies. They mourn the loss and eventually move on. Now imagine having that dead dog strapped to your back your entire life. Chronic illnesses are inescapable. No amount of positive thinking can help me. Nobody who is relatively healthy could ever really understand what its like. My mom is just worried about my schooling and my dad just told me to ""shut the fuck up and think positive."" I have 4 fucking siblings and they all got to turn out perfectly healthy and I got fucked by life and society.

I'm not going to live by society's rules anymore. I'm not going to suffer through college to get a degree and suffer through the job market to find a career and suffer through my career until I die. I'm not going to act like everything is okay. I'm not going to live for the sake of being alive. It's such a tragedy because if my asthma was a lot better I could have been happy. Deep down I really dont want to die. I'm fucking terrified to die. But I'm more terrified of being miserable the rest of my life. So I'm putting an expiration date on my life. I will continue to fight for my health and see more doctors and try new things to provide adequate relief. I will do this for about 6 more months. Then I'm counting my losses and checking out."
3140,Is 19 too young to commit suicide?,Or is it okay? I’ve seen enough. I don’t wanna be here anymore. I just want this all to be over.
3141,Aaaaaaand i’m getting worse,"if my parents would support me rather than just making drin of my mental health and suicide attempt i might have gotten better. but by doing what they’ve been doing i’ve been concentrating on suicide and how awful of a person i am, and i’m pretty sure i’m borderline anorexic. like fucking hell how pathetic can i get? a teenaged male with anorexia, bipolar, and either schizoaffective or DID. i just need a few days away from everything and everyone, but i can’t do that since i’ll be questioned about it, though i do have one friend group where i can do that, and it’s amazing that it’s an option. fml"
3142,So here i am i guess,"Never thought i'd make a thread on this depressing af forum but yeah, here i am.

21 years old, always in a shitty mood no matter what i do; unable to sleep properly; still a virgin, never in a relationship and i dont know why because i'm not fat or ugly and i'm not an asshole, at least that's what people tell me; 
i have a job that's decent but boring af and has a shit pay because i'm still an apprentice; i've never met a single person that gave me the feeling of being understood;
and tbh i can't really blame them because i can't even understand myself i feel like;

I'm a horrible person towards the few people i love although i don't want to.
 i can't see any future for me and honestly i think life doesn't have to offer anything anymore

I didn't even know what i should write because i can't get any clear thoughts anymore because i'm so sleep deprived

It's just a fucking drag to continue this shitty existence"
3143,Feeling conflicted,"Hi, i'm [M24] and i've been struggling with, and bottling up my depression for about 7 years now.
Probably longer, but i became sickingly aware of it around the time i turned 18.
It recently took a more violent turn however.
It all looked a lot brighter around a year ago, when i got in a relationship with my best friend [F25]. Half a year later, we got engaged. The only problem was her anxiety, and the distance between us (around 5500 miles). I saw her once every couple months for 3 weeks each time.

She was my motivation, and my goal in life was to become happy with her, and later start a family. (between 18 and 24, i was pretty much void of motivation, goals, or anything close to such things) 
We weren't really a perfect fit psychologically, seeing as she's hyper-emotional, and i have extreme trouble expressing my emotions, but we made it work for little over a year.
A couple of weeks ago, we had a talk, and decided that it would be best to end it for now, due to her inability to be alone for extended periods of time, and the plan for me to move there, would take around a year to come to fruition. (debt, green card, lawyers etc.) Ofcourse, i would visit multiple times, but that would set back the time slowly but surely. I don't like having to have made the decision, but it would tear her apart to have to deal with everything by herself, so i agreed to it because i understand, not because it's something i personally want. I would rather suffer through it, but i can understand not everyone feels the same way/things.

Now, i've been through a lot. A lot of my friends have died, mostly suicide. My parents never really gave me a ""home"". Most of the relationships i had, i've been cheated on. I got injured a couple of weeks before i was able to sign a contract with a pro- soccer club. I had to quit college because my parents had to move countries, yadayada. 

So, ofcourse, i was extremely happy to be with my lady. Even more so when she gave me the yes. 
But now that's over, and for about 4 weeks ish now, i feel like i force myself to be distracted, just to keep my mind off wanting to kill myself, because i have no clue how i'm supposed to live through all of this shit without the one person i care for..

Anyone maybe has/had similar experiences? And if so, do you mind explaining what worked for you? What kept you going?

Because the only things for me are my small siblings, and the fact that i might move there within 2 years ish anyways. However, she'll likely be with someone else already, and i don't know if i'm able to handle that. Especially not with how i'm feeling already just being without her..."
3144,goodbye.,"this is it, everyone in my house is asleep and im awake ready to end it, it was a good run lol, i deserve this for being so fucking useless. my knife is right next to me and i can not wait anymore, i should finish this up as fast as possible before i change my mind.

goodbye."
3145,I don’t belong anywhere,"Fuck it’s always been this way. Never had a friend, never talked to anyone unless I was forced to, and I try to avoid all people as much as possible. Why the fuck is this world designed in such a retarded way? The ones who hate life/socializing should be given jobs to do at home/basic income(to avoid wage slavery) and when they feel that they don’t want to be a part of the shitshow anymore then let them have a peaceful and painless suicide whenever they want. It’s not hard, it’s just society being idiotic and not recognizing that not everyone gives a fuck about the retarded game of “life”. 

Every fucking day that I have to live in this stupid  world makes me lose my mind even more. There’s nowhere to go in this world if you hate people and hate being a fucking slave. I guess I’m fucked. Life is fucking bullshit and I’m sick of it. Why even have a society if people are going to be living in dogshit conditions? Having all of this technology and money doesn’t mean shit if I still feel like dying. I won’t ever understand fucking life."
3146,Partner in crime,"Looking for some support, we could jump and hang together, 100 mph into bridge support on my snowmobiles, or if you have it we can go big pharma. Been looking to do this for a month and would like  to be gone by end of March"
3147,Suicide pill roulette,"I would like to go as peacefully as possible emotionally and psysically while putting my chemistry know how to use. so here's the plan
A 5 day course of pills with 1 of them being a diy extracted cyanide capsule and the other 4 being filled with sugar(death placebo?),I wouldnt be able to distinguish which one is which hence roulette .
I take one said pill along with my normal sleep pill each night till I hit the one with the cyanide and it hopefully somewhat mitigates the anxiety /fear of the whole ordeal"
3148,My fellow peers...,"I have read some of your stories and it hurts... I feel like all the shit that is going on with me is nothing and I'm worthless. You guys deal with tough shit and I'm over here crying about my dad, ed, body, family, school, grades, and just overall life. I'm sorry for being a dramatic ass bitch, who has no problems worth listening too. (I randomly changed the subject). My mom found out I was cutting, counting calories, starving myself, throwing up after I eat, burning, and trying to kill myself. She wasn't the happiest when she found out. (I change the subject again). My therapist is no help, she acts like what is happening to me is dumb, yes maybe to others but to me, it hurts. I just want a hug but nobody understands. Sometimes someone just hugging me and holding me, that right there, means the most. I feel like someone just holding you, that fills you with the relief that everything will be okay, for now. Knowing that someone cares is the best feeling, I think we all need someone who does. For some people, it's their dog. For others, its people on the internet. I think if we work together and just understand what people are going through, we are going to be the best help. People like a therapist, family, and sometimes friends, don't understand the pain because they haven't experienced it. (This now just turns into a rant). BUT, I do have to say suicide preventionist are dumb, they don't want people to kill themselves so they feel better about themselves. I feel like if you are going to do all of these things about people not wanting to kill themselves, can you at least just try to understand the amount of pain and hurt a person is going through. I don't understand that."
3149,"hey, i'm kinda losing my will to live. say something, please?",it doesn't have to be anything important. maybe just the best part of your day or the way your brother screams the lyrics to your favourite song at night in the car.
3150,"hey guys, I think I might do it tonight",today I was rejected by a girl who I so deeply care about and respect. I don't think anything can be restored how it was before today. The worst part is that I was the only one she could ever talk to and she had mental health troubles of her own. so now we are both without people we need and it's my fault and there is a voice blaring in my head that all I am is a worthless piece of shit. I can't think of a single reason not to do it because quite honestly I would be cleaning up the world a little bit.
3151,ALONE,"45 days alone in rental apartment, seeing kids who i adore and they love me only on Sunday for 9 hours,my boss gave me 2 fucking weeks to ""get some rest""...feeling totally disconnected from any society, family and friends on another continent....the only sound i hear is humming from the fridge,can't read books, can't watch tv...."
3152,Christmas eve,"Christmas eve. Thats when im gonna do it. Not 100% committed but very close. I hope i either die or get hospitalized. Fuck life, dont ever do this please."
3153,Does anyone else imagine themselves dead?,Just wondering. Ive started thinking about different ways to end it and imaging me doing it. I also can see my body  in third person.
3154,I’m not sure what to do,"I’m a teenager living at home and I’ve gone through some relationship trauma including having my name in a girls suicide note after she had a failed attempt. I’m seriously fucked up and in another relationship and I don’t want to impose my thoughts on my partner. There’s also school to worry about on top of it all. I’ve thought about suicide many times but I’ve never taken action. I’ve been to counseling before and I’ve asked my parents to go again and they won’t let me unless I tell them what’s wrong. I don’t want to tell my parents that love and care about me that I want to kill myself. I don’t want to talk about it with anyone I know personally because of the fear that they’ll care too much and feel as if they can’t help me, which is a situation I’ve been in. I don’t know what to do so I decided to post my thoughts to the anonymous people of reddit."
3155,"I hate feeling better, getting life back on track, moving on from the hurtful shit, finding new friends...","...and then getting hit on the head by a steel fucking pipe and being robbed of all the good and well-being that i've collected.

I saw a dream, of all things. It opened up memories I had buried some time ago. I thought I had moved on and put the past in the past, but oh no, 'tis just an illusion.

So like the classical domino effect, it culminated from having a small nightmare into saying ""fuck you"" to all the self improvement i've made because i'm not planning on being alive at the same time next year. Fuck."
3156,Exhausted,I’m so tired. Physically it’s hard to get out of bed. Mentally it’s hard to focus on work. Emotionally it’s hard to be in any relationship. I skip school and practice because I’m sick. I call off work because I want to lay in bed even though I need money. I let the phone go to voice mail because I don’t want to talk. Living is eating me alive.  And honestly I’m not loving I’m surviving doing the same thing every day for what? I don’t want to get better. I know I have to but everyone thinks I’m fine so I can’t even get help if I wanted to. I’m so tired of this.
3157,My bipolar roommate has drove me to suicidal thoughts this year and is now trying to tell all my friends she is the victim because I said she was crazy out of anger,"My roommate has serious manic episodes and refuses to get help. We can't break the lease because we'd each be paying 3000K in a fee and I just lost my job so I'm staying.

Basically she has manic phases and stays up till 4 am, then runs around and 6 am and wakes me up. She makes me so afraid I can't sleep. I tried to talk to her about it but she is impossible to reason with.

I was on the phone with my mother today and she was within earshot. I'm on 2 hours sleep and not making good decisions. My roommate thusly heard me say ""I can't reason with a crazy person, she can't be quiet in the mornings despite all my efforts, what else can I do? I'm gonna have to kick her out at the end of the lease.""

Now my roommate is going to tell all my friends I'm an asshole. My sister said I was being rude but anyone who has dealt with serious sleep deprivation knows the effects. It literally ruins your whole life. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not apologizing to her because I think she's an asshole, and in the past when I apologized to her she was able to twist my words and gaslight me into being ""wrong"" because she has grandiose narcissism.

I am considering ending my life because I think she's gonna ruin my reputation. Calling a bipolar person crazy doesn't look good, but neither does getting 2-4 hours sleep a night for a year and not being able to break the lease.

I tried using kid gloves, talking to her, white noise machine and earplugs, I tried telling her how it affected me... she has no empathy and is a sociopath. She isn't phased by pathos. 

I just lost my job and honestly I could just kill myself right now"
3158,I just hate everything,"Hello.

The title really says it. I just hate everyone and everything. I wish someone would mess with me so I can beat the crap out of them.

I guess this all stems to the fact that everyone treats me like a shit-kicker. People treat me however they want (its usually ignorance) and only come to me when they want something. I'm done. All throughout high school everyoes just walked all over me, and even my friends haven't really done anything to help me with it. Because I give and get nothing back, I get classed as a 'nice guy' which is the last fucking thing I want because everyone believes they finish last.... which is exactly whats happening to me!

18 years, just out of school, a good job, a couple friends who care but I still hate everything. I can picture someone challenging me and me breaking their face. I've seen so many counsellors and all have said the same thing; ""It'll get better"" but they have only gotten worse the more I try to make it better.

Oh, also, pile on the amount of times I have been rejected by girls i've liked. A kissless virgin in Australia at 18 is an instant loser, which is what people see me as.

I am really struggling, and I am not spending all 2020 like this. Ill die before I spend another year on this hellhole we call earth and society.

Phew that was a gutfull. :) does anyone else relate?"
3159,How effective is heroin,Is heroin a good drug to overdose on or is oxy better. Also I’ve never done either one so would it be a good idea to use these to overdose on?
3160,Why does this keep happening to me,"I'm 25 (M) and for over 7 years now I have dealt with serious mental health issues. At 19 I checked myself into a psychiatric unit at a hospital in brooklyn, over the next 5 years I would wind up going to inpatient units/hospitals a total of 5 more times. In 2018 I underwent over 25 sessions of ECT which ultimately ended when I was about to get another treatment and I told them i was having suicidal thoughts. My last hospitalization was in feburary, I tried suffocating myself but was interrupted. I really wish I wasnt interrupted. It's now 10 months later and here I am just waking up after sleeping for nearly 24 hours straight. I got into a fight with my parents yesterday my dad told me in relation to me not showering for 2 days that I ""disgust him."" I'm really glad he has become so sympathetic to my mental illness and that he feels okay being a bully.(sarcastic) I cant deal with anyone anymore I wish I had access to an inert gas because if I did I would finally have the peace I have been seeking."
3161,I'm suffocating on my own thoughts.,"In a few days I've got exams and I will fail two of them with no chance of passing. I have no real friends only two guys from highschool with whom I talk on Discord sometimes and some people who talk with me in University. I hate waking up, going to Uni and seeing everybody around me happy. The ""best"" part about my day is when I'm sleeping or laying in bed and surfing in the internet. I just want to die in my sleep or get killed in an accident. Why do I have to suffer???? WHY CAN'T I JUST DIE????"
3162,Final year?,"Maybe I should just die after Christmas. Forget the broken relationships, all the regrets, forget the stress of uni and lack of money. I've tried 6 different types of anti depressants over 3 years and they've done fuck all for me. Therapy didn't help either. I'm just so fucking done with everything. I just wish there was n easy way to end it all, I live in England so can't exactly just go get a gun"
3163,i got to have help.,like the title telling i got to have this no nosense or else i report the comment thanks in advice.
3164,"I need to talk to someone, an adult, anyone.","please would anyone do a voice call with me, I'm suffering so much I have no one. anyone would help a broken man and comfort me, I just need to feel like I am not alone, I don't want to hurt my family."
3165,She told me she'd look after my dog once I'm gone," (22F) My best friend and I went on a walk yesterday and I told her about my suicidal plan.
We sort of talked about the way I was gonna do it (She's the only one that knows I'm gonna kill myself),  and I told her that the only reason I wake up everyday is because of my dog, Milan. My parents told me that if I kill myself, they'd put him up for adoption. I don't want that for him. I wanna see him grow old, but know I won't be able to do so.
He means everything to me. A couple seconds passed, and she said ""Don't worry. If you ever kill yourself, I'll look after your dog""
Now I feel a lot better. The day I finally take that step, I'm gonna leave her and my family a letter. I hope she takes care of him when I'm gone."
3166,Ima go kill myself,Everyone and everything I cared about is dead
3167,I'm ending this soon,Soon I will end it and do everyone a favour.  The world will be a better place when I'm gone.
3168,I wish I could end it all,But it needs to look like an accident
3169,"""What are your problems"" - 12/9/19 - 5:52 pm","used a question someone asked me as a title :)

can't eat, can't sleep, and can't stop feeling like absolute shit. i want to go somewhere else. no more school, no more stress, no more responsibilities. life itself is confusing, and everything makes me want to curl up and die. it feels like an empty void in which i can't escape from even when i try so hard to get myself together. memories and guilt from the past keep creeping up on me, and i'm paranoid as hell. i'm losing everyone, and genuinely want to drown myself. i want a source of safety and security. the afterlife is where i'll find it. i don't believe in anything specific, and i'm not religious;; but i do believe i'll find *something*. i don't know who i am as a person, and i go by as someone completely different on all of my social media accounts in order to not worry anyone. i don't want to hurt anyone, but i need to clear my head."
3170,My best friend (24F) is currently in ER getting stitches after cutting her wrists too deep and I (22F) want to support her in every way I can but I'm also suicidal,"Title pretty much sums it up. I love her so much and I'm worried as hell but I don't know how to cope. I'm crashing at her place once she comes back from the hospital and I'm so scared she's gonna hurt herself again. I've stopped her before and I will stop her for sure if I catch her again but I feel like it's gonna take a toll on me this time. I know this is not about me but it's still very triggering and I really don't wanna lose her. The saddest thing is that I can't come up with uplifting words for her because everything seems like a ton of bullshit to me, I can't even cheer myself up. I guess I'll just hug her until she feels like eating and then hug her some more"
3171,I cant imagine how things could turn out okay anymore,"I'm just so alone. I have no friends. And I can't imagine that ever changing anymore. I've been alone for so long. I just can't do it.

I don't want to be the person that never has a relationship or friends. But I can't stop it. I just want this to stop.

Every day is fucking horrible. I'm always alone. And it's just going to keep being like that.

I want to blast off forever out of this wicked cruel world"
3172,I’m tired of living.,"I hate being alive. I work a shit part time job, and had to move in with my dad. My stepmother hates me for no fucking reason and constantly bitches at me for nothing. But honestly, I don’t care. I don’t care about my life, my future, and I honestly don’t really care about my family anymore. They’re all condescending and instigate arguments and unnecessary fights with me, but don’t realize I don’t give a damn. All I want is to live on my own, have a self sustaining job and to be left alone. But this seems impossible, I’m not rich so this will take years of dealing with shit that I’m way past fed up with. I just want peace. I want to die."
3173,Struggling to see a reason to carry on,"Don’t know where to begin, had the worst year ever. At the start of the year I was in a similar mindset and tried ending it where a close friend did it a few years earlier. Got pulled back over the bridge by a friend and got anti depressants and all that. 
I honestly went into the new year thinking you know what this is going to be my year.. I’ll turn my life around and be a better person for it, but looking back now.. it’s just worse. My grandparents both got diagnosed with horrible illnesses, grandma cancer and grandad Parkinson’s and I’m struggling to come to terms with whats going to happen and I don’t think I can cope. The one person I can trust to talk to about how my head is keeps telling me to find the happy points but I just can’t see any. I feel like I’m losing my mind, my anxiety has come back so bad and I’m pushing away the people I care about because my stupid head keeps thinking things that just aren’t there. 
No matter what happens I’ve always got this same voice in my head saying ‘I’ll be dead before the end of the year’ and it never goes away.. everyday I’m try to fight that voice but I’m just struggling to see a reason to carry on. I can’t get rid of the urge to just end it because I just don’t see a reason to carry on. All I want is to just pop pills till it’s over."
3174,I'm very concerned about my friend,"Hi, I'm sorry if post of this kind is not allowed but I'm very desperate. Today my friend told me that she has tried to kill herself 3 times. She said that she's not planning on trying again, and she's usually very honest and reliable but I'm not sure I want to risk it on an issue this serious. She says that she doesn't need help because she's getting better on her own, but honestly, I can't see it, she's still very distant, quiet and always looks very depressed. 

I feel like I should tell an adult about this (we're both only 16) but I don't want to betray her trust. She made me promise I wouldn't tell anyone. I don't want to risk losing such an amazing friend but i feel really bad betraying her like that, even if it is to keep her safe. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I love her so much and I really don't want to lose her."
3175,Too tired to think. Breaking down,"I sunt even know anymore. I've been dissociated for solid three hours and I'm too distanced from my mind to think

I haven't felt this suicidal since a trauma arose three (?) years ago. It felt so alluring. Like I needed it. I could have overdone my allergy meds and it'd probably kill me. Or I could have electrocuted myself in the bathtub

But I've had emotions come back to me, to my numb self, for an hour and I felt guilty that my girlfriend is stuck with such an idiot like me
Even though it's not my fault

But I'll always hurt her. She'd be so much better off without me

Now I understand even better why is it said that dating a person with bpd is like waking in shattered glass. It's just true

I just feel so tired now and I'm not as suicidal but I'm fucking scared that my meds just stopped working. Which makes no sense. They can't just randomly stop working, right?...

Ftr I was diagnosed with bpd and depression asking other things and I'm in lamotrigine, sertraline and valproate

I don't understand what's wrong. I just want to fucking die. I could have died those three years ago... Maybe it would've been better if I have"
3176,Goodbye,"The last few days have been the worst of my life, I am done with everything. Even when I try to reach out on reddit nobody gives a shit and I don’t blame them. I’ve reached my limit, I can’t bring myself to endure one more excruciating day. I have absolutely no prospects and no reason to continue."
3177,Ready to tap out,"Life is just getting so exhausting. I’m about to turn 25 and I feel like my youth is slipping away. Im not sure if I’m suicidal but the thought that killing myself is always an exit button is reassuring. I lived for partying and my fraternity in college and now that I’m a year removed, it’s clear i developed an alcohol problem. I love the partying scene and always seem to go back to it on the weekends. Even my old friends from college are starting to get concerned for me. I barely have any money, my parents are always disappointed in my actions and I’m about to start graduate school in January. Part of me just feels like i can’t take it anymore and want to bring it all to an end."
3178,"life is starting to turn against me, fuck I need to kill myself soon.",it's becoming harder and harder to live everyday...
3179,I have no reason to live,"Everything keeps going downhill and everyone IRL hates me and internet strangers are the only social contacts I have. No friends, severe anxiety issues, school's fucked up, parents scream at me daily, sleep issues, fuck my life tomorrow I'm not coming back home"
3180,I'm tired,"I'm a fucking failure. I have no friends, no interests, nothing makes me happy. I have suicidal thoughts every minute. When I cross the street I can only think about being hit by a car. When I cross the bridge, my mind tells me to jump. These thoughts never go away even for a moment. I can not sleep at night. I cry every day. I'm failing school because of math. I study so much yet I fail every exam, I'm useless trash wasting oxygen. I wish I hadn't been born. 

I try to put on a happy face everyday, look normal, but inside I'm at my limit. I'm so exhausted from constantly fighting with my mind telling me to kill myself. I want to give up. I think that I will do the world a favour since I'm completely useless. 
I never thought I would seriously think about this. And I feel so guilty when I think about my family. They still love even though I'm a failure. But I'm so tired. I want this misery to end already. I'm a fucking worthless piece of shit."
3181,I'm out of options,"The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't have any resources to do so. I have no gun, no place to hang myself, no bathtub to bleed out in, I have fucking nothing. I'm constantly trapped inside my dying fragile mind and idk what to do. I can't even fucking cut myself to ease my frustration because my parents will see it and I can't let that happen again like it did last time I cut myself. I just want to die in my sleep, if I was religious I would pray that I would just have a stroke and fall over dead or some shit. I don't wanna fuck with this anymore. I'm just fucking sad all the time, and the worst part is idfk why. I've never spoken to a therapist so idfk if I actually have depression. All ik is I'm sad all the time and I can't seem to be happy no matter what I try to do, and I'm out of options. I'm just stuck like this, and idk what to do to escape. I just feel really hopeless rn. And I hope I don't fucking wake up tomorrow."
3182,If I don't wake up tomorrow,"Let it be known that I tried my best.
I'm sorry I never met your standards mother but believe me I've tried.
I'm sorry little sisters I've never been the big brother i was supposed to be
I'm sorry that I couldn't find a therapist in time father 
I'm sorry teachers who seen my cuts I never wanted to burden yall.
But tonight Im going to go for a record amount of cuts and deepness of those cuts so if I don't return let this be my last post, my last word
""Im Sorry"""
3183,I hurt everyone around me,I don't have anyone to talk about this to. I'm realising how much fucking damage I do to everyone whether direct or indirect. I can't stand myself. I hate who I've become when did this happen. What a piece of shit. I hate this body I hate this life. Why do I hurt people. If I stay I hurt people if I go I hurt people. What kind of fucking sick torture is this. I never wanted this. I wanted to help. I can't live like this I can't feel like this. It's too much.
3184,Help with friend,"Hi, never used reddit before but need opinions on how I should something. Found out by accident a while back that a friend is suicidal. Have never talked to her about it because I figure it’s much easier for them if I just treat them normally, as she has closer friends for that stuff. That and the fact that idk if she knows that I know she’s suicidal (was having an emergency and called a closer friend I was with). Either way, she was acting a little different/sentimental last night and I have a gut feeling, a bad one. Already decided that Im gonna reach out more and just be closer, but im debating talking with her about it. My big issue is whether or not this would help, which is where I’d like some opinions. I have suicidal tendencies too, on lithium now, was checked into a mental health facility, the whole shabang. If I were to have a heart to heart, i was thinking of saying something along the lines of “everyone loves you (which sounds corny but is true), Ive been in a similar situation and yeah it fucking sucks, youre not alone in this, if you ever need someone to talk to without judgement call me.” Last thing I wanna do is minimize her problems by introducing my own, but feel like some level of relatedness could be good. Also worried that if I dont act soon shes gonna do something. Pls help"
3185,I feel very close to the edge,"I'll keep this brief here and reply in comments if anyone actually sees this, but I have never felt closer to taking my life. I've tried before, been self harming more and more recently, and feel like I keep fucking everything up. People seem to think it too. I'm sorry is this is structured badly, but I currently feel like screaming and punching something, and doing a million other impossible things. I just don't know how to come back from this one. Not anymore."
3186,Im ending this tonight,"Goodbye, going for a last ride.

Killing yourself over debt, i deserve it though."
3187,Just made my decision.,I decided the 2nd January is going to be my last day on earth. Any thoughts for things that I should do before standing before a train?
3188,I’m 19 years old and a lost cause,I’m a failure. I was destined to fail the second I was born. No matter what I do I always fail and mess up. I know my mother is disappointed in me everyone is. I do nothing with my life. I’m jobless I have social anxiety and this makes me feel forever hopeless. I do nothing to help my self because I realise that there isn’t any point in doing so. I’m drinking my self to death hoping that kills me sooner rather than later. I’ve got nothing I’ve lost everybody that actually gave a fuck about me and now I’ve only got my self.
3189,No reason,Life is a big fucking tornado and I don’t want any part of it any more come and take me away or I’ll do it myself
3190,I wish dying was easy.,Imagine if you could just wish to die in your sleep and not affect anyone I’d do it in a heart beat. I wish i can just die and not hurt my family and friends. I don’t want any attention when i die. I just wish people would be cool with it.
3191,I survived,"I survived it. Won't go into details unless it's via PM but I didn't die. Thank you for the messages, I'll reply to them as soon as I feel anything, right now I don't. I'm not being taken to a psych ward, fortunately or unfortunately, I do not know what to think yet. I got checked at the hospital, they looked at my lungs, for any signs of brain damage. Nothing. I have no idea where to go from here."
3192,What the hell am I supposed to do?,"I find myself zoning out, completely and utterly in  love with these suicidal fantasies. I see myself coming back here a lot, talking here a lot, posting, reading, scrolling. It's all I ever think about. Lately, it's really started affecting my general life, I can't go a few hours without getting distracted by these thoughts, and it's hard. It's really hard. Hard to cope with, and hard to talk about. 

I don't get why living is such a big deal, it doesn't seem that important in general. Nothing seems that important in the grand scheme of things.

I feel like my entire life is just on repeat, it's the same few things, over, and over, and over. And I'm tired, and I'm stressed, and I've already given up a long time ago. The only reason I'm still here (barely) is because I'm a coward. 
 
I'm plagued with these horrific thoughts of violently murdering myself in various ways, I always think something is out to get me, stalking me, and I've stopped caring, and yet still, I'm always worrying. 

Being alive is a really large responsibility that I'm not ready for. 

Now what? What do I do? What happens now? I'm too scared to die, do I just live my life suffering?"
3193,I'm not afraid of heights anymore.,I keep finding myself on ledges just looking down and crying. I think I'll jump soon. Idk when. But it doesn't scare me anymore
3194,A goodbye to all of you,"Hello guys im writing this with such headache and pain as well as numb feelings so I apologise for my grammatical mistakes in advance being here on reddit and reading peoples stories from subs like this helped me feeling less alone so id like to say thank you to all of you.
My life has been only going downhill for the last two years. I needed help but i just couldn’t get any, for some financial and other issues. I met someone and I thought they would be able to help me but they sort of neglected my feelings. Not going to get in details but they lost feelings for me for a long time and they have been planning to end it with me for couple of months now in most horrid way whilst telling me that they love me and want to marry me, at least that’s how it seems to me it all seems perfectly planned. They are mocking me online now by twisting shit, making fun of my mental state and just basically telling people that i’m awful. At this point everythings been posted about me. My professors, my students as well as class mates and colleagues have seen it all which will get me into big trouble. My family has seen it but they are not saying anything as of now since I have been walking around my house like a damn ghost. I’ve deleted my social media, i am going to leave the house as if i’m going to uni tomorrow. I will walk around the city and if I don’t chicken out i will do it, somehow. I feel really bad for my family but i know if i keep continue living like this i will bring nothing but shame to them. I don’t think anyone will realise who i am besides a few people iv chatted here but I still want to say that if anyone that knows me gets to read this, i’m sorry i’m not this monster that they are making me to be i’m just hurting so much. I love you mum, you are the only one who truly cared about me i’m sorry for making you upset recently. Goodbye everyone, goodbye world. It’s an ugly world."
3195,2020,"I’m considering to kill myself in 2020. I just don’t want to screw up the holidays for my family so I’m gonna wait. I’ve never really been happy which also is because I’ve been suicidal since I was 12. I’m 18 now
I was in a relationship for 2 months with a guy with ADHD. That meant he was very violent and very good at making me feel guilty. I thought many times that I should break up with him. But he just kept telling me that he would kill himself without me. 
So when I finally did it. He took an OD. And i just tried to think of myself first and make myself happy. But instead I just made somebody else’s life terrible... 
I want to die! And it doesn’t seem like anybody cares. I tried talking with a friend and he just laughed:("
3196,I think I’m going to attempt tonight,Or at least self harm
3197,I know nobody cares,"Been trying to reach out to friends over and over and nobody seems to really care, I’ve DM’d several friends and made multiple posts on instagram stating I’m struggling and everybody ignores it. A friend of mine said a week ago we’d go get coffee, today she bailed. She said she would be available starting at 2 PM to chat today, she never called, so at 4, I called her. 10 minutes into that call, she said “Hey I need to do something before my mom comes home at 5, and it’s not something I can do on call” (implying nsfw stuff). So I hung up.  
I just feel so fucking discarded and unloved. My therapist isn’t available. My psychiatrist is ignoring my messages. My friends are ignoring me asking for help. The one friend that doesn’t ignore me only talks for 10 minutes at a time, and then leaves to go masturbate. What’s even the point? All I want to do right now is drink and smoke but I can’t do either of these things anymore bc my parents don’t let me."
3198,Raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up.," 

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this."
3199,"Where should I point the gun for the quickest, most painless death?","And I have accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior, so will I go straight to Heaven?"
3200,Im tired,Need to create an appropriate abstrac t to the text but sometimes i breathe in and breathe out and feel nothing not any joy or pain or hint of emotion each time i breathe respiring my cells the only prominiont and cosnistent thought is to recive death as death is sweet no pain or joy no one to worry or care about just you except it aint you. You feel the true shallwoness of nothing cant compare the feeling to sleep because im sure death is more conclusive than that no one will ever know they are dead because there is no waking up no relisation of anything anymore just the experince of the void and eternal phyasical psychological silence. no thoughts no cognitive proccesses just what i see as paradise before i was born i was fine so if death may come no need to feel any sorrow it is the way of life. Everyone will be evntually be gifted with this. We are bounded to death we run it chases sure outrunning prosponing is possible but what is the pint when death is eternal. The time you use to run away from death and subtract it to eternity is still infinity. What we are is somehwat insignificant pointless cause eventually history time will erode anything prominant we done in this world. For some our footsteps may always be visabale but no one will ever know the peron that made them.We will all die it will all end we know it Iknow it we know it anything ever loved has an expiration has a closing chapter Me temi that has written this will also one day die deprression made that clear to me but im not afriad and even if im sad when death arrives theres nothing to feel after the effects have taken action pulling the trigger noose on neck or natrual course of life being your demise. All this means its preety pointless in doing anything life is just aflare of conciousness so twempiroly that it as taken us out of the period of eternity of nothingness to feel the exact opposite of that . Life isnt a journey because you dont have to do anything for it to end ur existence could be spent living in your bedroom minnimum effort and evetually your heart will stop beating one day
3201,I’m strongly contemplating suicide,"I have an average life, nothing too bad. But I did something really bad to screw it up. I think I’m going to get caught and I don’t want to live anymore.

I resigned from the company two weeks ago. While there I transferred money from the company to myself, totaling about $40,000 over the course of a year. This company is doing a lot of illegal activity, so I did not feel bad. I did report them to the state after I left though. I kinda hoped they would get shut down for their illegal activity before they get suspicious. While employed there was no way they could’ve known I was taking money. But now that I’ve left they are getting suspicious. They contacted an investigator who is questioning me. I don’t know if they’ll be able to prove it, but if they do I 100% will be convicted.

This is too much, I’m married and my wife doesn’t know that I did this. But I can’t do this anymore. If they find out, I will commit suicide. There is no other option..."
3202,i wanna die,bottom text
3203,"Fuck everything, life has no purpose. There’s literally no reason for me to be alive yet here I am.","I’m a nihilist, all my life I’ve been pondering the deeper questions, what is the meaning of life, why are we here, is there any purpose for us yadadadadada. I can’t say that I’ve come to a conclusion, but I just see it as life isn’t worth living. Everything is going to shit, the next generation will probably be the last of our dying breed. We’ve ruined our world enough and every human born is another shitty soul that puts up a shit stain on this earth. I’m no exception, no one is. We pollute our only home, we destroy forests en mass, we kill billions of animals every year just to feed our growing population that will eventually collapse. We’ve reached a tipping point, everything is going to shit because of us. We vote for shitty politicians that only work in their own interests and not for the people, we kill each other, we have always done that. Some where on this blue earth some innocent life is taken everyday by war. Things aren’t getting better, it’s getting a lot worse. There’s no reason for us to live anymore, not me, not you. Not anyone. We’re a dying species, in our last light. The future won’t be bright, it will be dark and grim. War will ravage every corner of the planet, everyone will be fighting for resources, whilst climate change will make billions of people flee from their homes. Until we finally succumb to ourselves. 

There’s no reason to continue this shitty life, people always ask me how I can be depressed it seems like I have everything, a loving family, high education etc. but the more you look at beautiful planet and humanity you’ll understand that we’re the cause of the 6th mass extinction, there’s no denying it. We will die off, life isn’t worth it. It has no meaning."
3204,I feel wrong about everything.,"I feel like someone who just doesn't understand the first thing about anything. Anything I do from the way I speak, the way I talk, the way I think is wrong. I fall in love immediately with the first person to have any interest in me, even if I know they are faking it, and I try my best to please them and be the perfect person to them. I keep second guessing my every move and trying to be selfless. Then when I feel unsatisfied and unwanted, I always get told I am selfish and that I am not worth it and I am actually a horrible person who won't listen and won't understand that the relationship I was in wasn't about me. I make stupid mistakes thanks to my overthinking and I end up hurting the person I try to be with and it always leads to me begging for another chance until the person gets frustrated and I leave with no money or lesson or understanding of what I did wrong or anything. I feel like I don't understand what emotions are and how to control them. Responses from people are always either that I'm an okay guy or someone who is so frustrating that I need to just leave them alone. Everyday I wake up trying to please everyone. Trying to not have enemies. Trying to prove to others and to myself that I can be likeable, that I am not a failure, that I am worth of love and life but I cannot remember a single time I actually believed that. A single time I saw or heard someone say a compliment that wasn't out of pity. I am tired of waking up and thinking I am worthless, knowing that no matter how I try no girl will ever like a man with so much self doubt and fear. I fall in love so easily and I try to please the person I love but I always am confronted with the simple truth that I am not good enough for them. And then my confidence drops even lower and I still have to fake like I have some or people get bored of my attention seeking pity Wells. If feel happy then I remember all the suffering people go through to give me my everyday food and technology and I remember all my mistakes and times people proved I am weak and fearful and worthless. When I am sad and I see the pity in others' eyes I just get angry at myself. Turning another day into people having to comfort you for your self doubts which makes you hate yourself even more. I don't want to wake up anymore thinking about suicide 24/7 and being one step away from ending it. I don't even want to wake up anymore at all. Even my therapists have given up on me, constantly spouting that I should just get over my issues and not let them bother me anymore like it's fucking easy. I need love but I know I don't deserve it. I need confidence but I know I haven't done anything to earn it. I need respect but I know I am not good enough to have it even from myself. I need friends even though I cannot accept friendship or kind words. I act flustered and blush and shy fully knowing it's all just people hoping I won't kill myself so that my family won't be sad. I am sick of everything. I am sick of me. I want to clone myself just to kill him over and over. People like me should be murdered in the streets and raped and tortured. I don't know what to do. I don't want to die but I will never forgive myself for being this pitiful. For being this attention seeking. For being this weak and worthless and ungrateful and unkind and selfish. I just want to be kidnapped and tortured and raped and killed because nothing else will satisfy me. I need justice for all the sadness I cause every second I breathe."
3205,Finally read his note,"My partner is going through some tough financial matters. He feels everything caving in on him. Last night we fought and it triggered it again. It built up to the point where he isn’t affected by anything emotional. And he decided to write his letter to his sister explaining how sorry he was for not being there for her. And called himself a disappointment to his parents. Ends it with “I hope everyone has a good life bc I sure didn’t get to. I’m sorry”. He gave it to me said make sure my sister gets it and proceeds to yell and argue with me. I never read it till now. And my pain will never compare n amount to his and I’ve never felt more useless than now. He feels as though he’s only taken losses with me and is losing everything slowly. 
It’s not my story rn but it’s taking a huge toll on me as well. 
He’s doing well today. Went to second day of work. Just Not eating like he should be. Sick, and hurt. But god how of a brave face he puts on, even after such harsh words, and blame, I will always love him unconditionally, therefore I’m not going anywhere he needs all the love everyone has to offer showing him not everything will be messed up and I want to do what I can to help him. I need big advice."
3206,Mother acting aggressive towards me over painful illness I suspect psychopathy,"For over the past year i have been suffering an extremely painful condition that causes very severe heat intolerance, and shortness of breath, i am unable to ever exercise and often I am unable to speak because it can trigger chest pain.

I was listening to files on my phone and I realized that if I have severe pain and my mother acts aggressive or cruelly towards me it is a sign of psychopathy. The audio clip includes lies and manipulation about mental illness, lies and manipulation about me being a drug user which I am not. And claims that all my pain and illness is just a delusional disorder.

I know that my mother has dyslexia because she has told us she had severe dyslexia as a child and it is obvious when she has a lot of difficulty using computers and she very often needs my help with computers and various other tasks.

3207,Don’t Know If I’ll Make It To 2020,"I’ve been suicidal before.  Not like this though.  Part of me wonders if it’s the Prozac, or all of my other demons finally catching up to me.  Probably both.

It feels like I’m in a dark hole.  I’m trying to reach out and feel happy again but there’s this barrier between me and everything else.  I don’t know who the fuck I am anymore.

I think I’m trans.  I’m struggling with my fucked up sexuality.  And part of me feels ashamed and wonders if this is all going back to when I was molested as a kid.  And honestly I don’t personally give a shit but it seems like my stupid fucking body/biology does.

I’m not gonna lie.  I used to enjoy the idea of suicide because it calmed me and brought a sense of peace to things.  This is different.  It feels like I’m being torn up from the inside and that killing myself would be the final gasp of my dying soul.

My disassociation is back with gusto.  I have no job.  No prospects.  I’ve been through a lot of shit but I’ve never felt this bad.  At least not in a long long time.  Even during the worst year of my life.

It’s taking everything I have not to get a knife and just end it.  Not even the prospect of my family is helping to hold me back as much anymore.  I think I’m finally going insane and it sucks.  I don’t want this to be the way I go out goddamnit.

Will it ever get better?  Probably.  But how fucking long until it gets worse again?

I’m so tired of hating myself.  I’m just...so fucking tired."
3208,I want to die in January,"Either by alcohol poisoning, or jumping off my balcony.
I want to do it. I'm done with being alive and hurting. Am simply sticking around so I don't ruin festivities. I have not lived a Christmas with my mother for the last three years, where I lived in another country. I wanna make this count, at least. Then I'll be free. I'll feel free. I want that."
3209,"Someone Reddit or posted about taking some drugs to kill herself, what can we do?","I hope this is the right place to post this.
I stalked her profile and she's probably from Turkey. I think this might be for real and I'm packing a bit. Where to call so somebody can check on her? https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/e8ev5q/finally_found_the_courage_to_kill_myself/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share"
3210,why do people care about me lmao,"i don’t want to get better bc what will i do with myself????

why even try on someone that doesn’t want to get better???

im fucking suffering just let me go

why bother taking care of me when i’m gonna take my own life"
3211,"Everything I see, I just think of ways I can kill myself with it.",Anyone else do this?
3213,A poem for my suicide,"I am a believer that we come into the world to be warriors that despite the circumstances will always be there to support lost causes, those causes that are all random but in order to generate a common good for all. I do not know why we are so flimsy to life situations, those situations that make you fall or decay, no doubt, we are prone to die of diminution if we do not rethink. We are human therefore, we can stand up to so much evil that there is in the world, yes, a world polluted by banal things, a world polluted by envy, lust and among many other things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a believer that we come into the world to be warriors who despite the circumstances will always be there to support the lost causes, those causes that are all random but in order to generate a common good for all. I'm not perfect I know, I'm not the prettiest I know, I'm not the best son, I know, I'm not the best husband, I know. But what I do know is that I came with a goal and that goal is to be happy no matter what happens, without fear of dying, without fear of what others will say.

&amp;#x200B;

I have something to tell you, when I was 7 years old I was a victim of sexual abuse by a stepfather and a cousin, my family was dysfunctional all my life, my mom was never in my graduations, she was never in the important moments for me, but here I am, made a man capable of facing the worst wars and I know that I will win whatever happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I can not say that I am not happy, because I am, there are times when I eat only once a day, but I ate, I sleep in a house that only has a bed, is a hard start, yes, but here I continue and I will continue, no one will ruin my future, I do not have a job, but I like to write, I try to write more often but nobody reads to me, that does not matter I know that someone is going to arrive and is going to get hooked with my reading, I am a very good and pleasant person, I have no luxuries, or anything, I only have 5 t-shirts, 2 pants, 4 boxers and a pair of shoes, and with that I feel happy.

&amp;#x200B;

For some people it is difficult not to have a job, not to eat three times a day, but you always have to be grateful to God, because you have life and health. Here I am, using steemit, cent, trybe, reedit  to vent and find an impulse to continue writing and to take me into account, I just tell them to follow, whatever happens you are ready for something big, do not surrender, and if you want to surrender write me that gladly from my well help you out of your well. Thank you and a hug."
3214,I fucked up,"I'm a bisexual in the closet. Pretty attractive guy and kind of smart. Was in a 4 years relationship with a guy. Everything was great.  I was successful at uni, having friends, good social live but couldn't feel happy. Thought that my bf is responsible for that cus there were signs of toxic relationship. Everything started getting worse. I lost contact with my friends. Even with the one that didn't left I can't openly talk about my problems. My GPA fall from 9.7 to 8.4 I don't go to my classes. I don't feel comfortable with myself nor I feel that I fulfill people's expectations and there are a lot. When I started fantasies about having emotional relationships with other people decided I should break up with him. And we broke up but things are getting worse. Miss him a lot  in the same time I'm having a strong crush about a guy from Norway (I'm from Macedonia). I feel extremely lonely, started drinking. After pushing my ex away he finally decided to stop talking with me. I have no one to talk to now. I stopped talking with my parents too (who doesn't live with me) cus they were putting their problems on my back. It seems like I'm using the false opinion people have for me to talk with them, but I'm pushing too hard. I can't see an option where I'm not as sad. I'm not asking to be happy I just don't want to be so sad. It's really painful. I can't see a lot of options. I destroyed the chances to fulfill my goals. I will stop writing to the people. I will stop fighting, I will stop with the pathetic things I do for self improvement. None of them work. I'm having  a week in front of me. If no one of the people I care about decided to contact me by the end of this week. I'm gonna kill myself!"

3217,What is the easiest way to give yourself Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?,
3218,I’m tired.,"I’m tired of waking up every morning feeling so horrible and hating that fact that I’m alive. I’m only 24 but all I’ve ever known was despair. With a recent break up and my chronic pain, my constant miserableness, the sadness... I am getting to that point where I’m ready to make the decision to go. I attempted at 16 but it failed when i was found in time for them to save me. I lost my sister to suicide when she was 22 5 years ago. I don’t even blame her. Life is absolutely horrible and I can’t do another 70+ years. I am so ready to go."

3221,"I'm really tired, not sure why to bother anymore.","My life feels like it's been falling apart lately. Over a decade long relationship ended recently because I didn't take my mental health seriously, and drank too much, and now I'm living with my abusive mom, who's.. really not nice. Everyday things are getting worse. I'm a complete mess, and I don't have anything really going for me. I'm on disability since I was born to be a waste of space, and I'm just going to have to start over again anyway. Don't really have many material possessions or anything. Pretty much just what would fit in a backpack is all I have, and I'm too exhausted to care anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

It sucks but no one would even miss me either. I don't have friends, I'm not close to anyone in my family and most of them don't really like me. Pretty much the only person who talks to me is my mom, but she didn't take long to start chipping away at me. I don't really like being treated badly and it's not like I have any other options. 

&amp;#x200B;

 The only one that might miss me if I'm gone is my mom's dog. But he's a dog, he'll be OK."
3222,Worried for a friend.,A friend of mine has been having a hard time recently. Not to get to into it now but i was really worried for him. I let him know that I'm there for him no matter what and he said in passing that it was so bad he wanted to kill himself. After that a repeated the idea that i was there for him. I really don't think it would be good to talk to college or his parents or anything. I was wondering if i am overreacting or if not any tips to try and be supportive without overstepping and making things worse for him. At the moment i think it would be best to offer support whenever i can.
3223,Why isn't assisted suicide legal for everyone?,"This world feels like a prison you cannot get out of, if not through pretty risky methods that don't guarantee results anyway.

I just want to stop existing. I'm not saying this because I'm crazy or too mentally flawed (apart from situational depression), I'm not, so no amount of therapy and advice is gonna change my mind. I'm looking at it in an objective way. I fought and failed, then fought harder and still failed.
My ultimate wish is to just get out, but I'm scared of pain. I want to be assisted for my last moments. But this world is a goddamn prison and society doesn't want me to fullfill my wish nor respects my decision, it just wants to torture me alive."

3226,My sister in law attempted suicide last month.... Please help me what shall my family do so that it doesnt happen again,"My brother was married in dec '17. We live in India, so it was an arranged-then loveish marriage. My brother works a job which requires him to live in different parts of the country,so naturally they both live away from us. 

Last month,they both went to a holiday destination with my sister-in-law's friend and her husband. Her friend always abused her husband,always fights and whatnot. They always say they will get divorced but always lives together.   
Her husband is also a  big lunatic. So,as usual they both were fighting in the resort, and my SIL(sister in law) tried to console them. She,my SIL, also has a weird personality.She gets influenced easily by her friend and then slaps and abuses my brother. When this first occurred in the resort, my brother slapped her when she didn't stay put and started tearing her clothes. Then, he said, if u want to fight, lets go home and resolve there, that he doesn't want to create a scene there.

My SIL was always roaming everywhere with her friend and so eventually, my brother and the other guy were always together. So , my SIL was was infuriated at my brother because he would not  give her attention time and went out with that Bastard. She again abused my bro and the other guy. 

Next day,in he morning, she fought again with my brother and ran to the shore. So,my brother ran to ""save her"" as waves were high and it was raining due to a tropical storm.Eventually all four of them were there on the beach and she hurled abuses on her friend's husband and he then did the same.She then slapped that guy and he also slapped her 2-3 times. My brother didn't interfere in between as she was at fault. They, then came in the room,and fight broke out between my bro and her.Her friend came and acted like kerosene. After an hour they again had a big fight and she again started tearing all her clothes my brother had gifted her. She claimed that my brother should have smacked the other guy's ass .That He didn't favor her and didn't take her side. In that instant, she jumped from the 2nd floor of  the resort. My brother rushed her and grabbed her hands but lost the grip. Somehow, she landed on the railing of 1st floor and then fell to ground floor.

Ambulance came and she was admitted. She didn't spoke to my brother properly for 4 days and always asked for divorce.He always said that lets go home and we will get it done.

Her 8th and 12th vertebrae column got compressed and her ankle broke into pieces. It was like she had a complete mental breakdown. She would cry at one instant,then said i wont leave you,The next moment she wanted divorce.

Her so called best friend attacked my brother verbally that he was such a loser. He was under control and didn't say much fearing the consequences. Both , her friend and her husband left that place and took a flight back home. My brother somehow, toiled her back in a train as doctor had advised complete bed rest to her and didn't permit them to use plane. Also,a complaint to police was made by the hospital for further investigations but it was disposed as they said to everyone that she fell from the stairs.

Later, she had her leg surgery and doctor has now advised her complete bed rest for a least 3 months to let her back heal. She has extreme pain where she is sat down straight.

Now, a bit about my SIL. She has done her graduation 5 years earlier and didn't pursue studies listening to her best friend. Instead she started preparing for a competitive exam and failed.She has the problem of epilepsy and is currently has ongoing medicine but no improvement is visible. She has seizures once around every 2 months approx.

She doesn't watch a single movie,tv show, has no hobby,nor does like to read,travel,etc. She,after marriage had made my brother the center of her world. Its like she was obsessed with him.

But the most importing thing for her is how other people think of her. After that incident,she told my brother to not tell what she has done and about her injury to anyone. But he did tell us. My mother got angry and sad and told her mother. SIL fought with my brother why we told her mother,that she has a heart condition and watnot.

Earlier, she also threatened my brother that she would slit her wrist as he didn't celebrate her birthday in the mall. My brother was busy that day and didn't have a single second free and offered that they both will go out next day.

As of now she is doing a 2 year course my father suggested she should do. We got her enrolled earlier this year. She completely hated this course as it was a teaching job and was not ""AS WELL REPUTED"" as other govt jobs for which ""she failed to qualify for"".

My family has decided to start her psycho therapy as soon as she gets better to cure her depression.

Today,a causal conversation was going on and I asked her to rethink about what she did and how it could have ended badly than it is now.I told her never to forget the intensity of this situation. How shw could have died,or had paralysis or other dire consequences and how my brother could go to jail and all such things.

I told her to stop caring about what other people think of her and dont let anyone else come between you two people and influence you.

She still blames it was my brothers fault that he didn't favor her,and her bitch friend who brainwashed her mind.

She do not not accept her fault.

When, I said ,if some similar fight happens between the two of you, would you do it again.

She said NO. I asked her why not. She replied,""IT HURT TOO MUCH THIS TIME AND I CANT IMAGINE HURTING MY BODY AS YOU KNOW I LOVE MY BODY SO MUCH"". She is the one who stops eating,if she finds 1 gm of her  weight increased.She always go to gym one and maintains her her hair and personality to show off  to everyone. She want to be always right and think good about her. 

&amp;#x200B;

This answer of her worries me so much and I am thinking about it for the past 2 hours and hence, writing this here so as to gain a few insight of what my family should do next. I am worried for her and  my brother.

3227,I want to kill myself (or get admitted to the hospital) but I don’t want to miss Christmas or ruin it for my family.,
3228,I want my life to end,"I've had enough of everything. I want to end it so fucking bad and I'm not sure how long I can keep preventing myself from actually doing it. Every night I want to do it yet I don't, when I wake up I don't want to get up, every day is almost the same, there's no point in going on. I do nothing and I'm no use either. So why would I keep on going? What's the point of me living? When all I probably do is bother people. It's been getting worse since a few months ago and it just doesn't stop! First it didn't feel like I was depressed but now it of course does. First it was just thoughts and now I actually want to do it. 
Yes okay, my friends cheer me up. But no one knows I want to die so bad. I do want to tell a friend but I don't know who! My friends aren't like that, they probably don't even care that much about me. Maybe I can talk to one friend but I don't know how. I'm too scared to ask her if I can talk to her. Oh God no. I'm not like that, I shouldn't do that. 
You should know that I'm getting professional help but that's just making things worse at the moment. Sorry if this bothered you, I just want to know what to do at this point. Thank you if you comment."
3230,My life is over I’ve gone crazy and it’s all because my obsession,I hate myself I hate everything I’ve done I hate living every day all because I fucked up with one girl but this girl is the only girl for me and she hasn’t talked to me in two years and I’ve just been deteriorating ever since I’m already an alcoholic at 20 and I’ve wanted to kill myself for the past year I’m just too scared to do it

3232,You are enough.,"I know this might sound like just another bullshit comment from someone who doesn't know what you are going through and doesn't care. And, perhaps, I really have no idea what your life is like. I just want you to know this:  


You. Are. Enough.  
There is no reason to strive for impossible goals. There is no reason to feel lesser than others, or unworthy in any way. You might not realize it, but you make the world a better place by just being you. You might think that noone cares about you. WE care. We really care. Many of us know your struggles, some even know the feeling of losing a loved one to suicide. Don't be afraid to ask for help, because there's no way to help a dead person. If you really feel like there's nothing to lose, just try talking about it with someone. I cannot guarantee it gets better, only that it's worth the try.  


We care. All of us care. I care. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here for you, and I will listen.  


I wish you the best of luck, and a long and happy life. Fingers crossed."
3233,well,"i’m like 88 lbs and took 24 of my 25 mg zoloft, 30 of my 10 mg lexapro, and just drank some svedka .. would it send me to the er?"
3234,I don’t know what to do,"Had a mutual break up last night. It was needed, I thought that we would stay really close friends and it would be okay. I struggle with PTSD, Anxiety, and Depression. I’m in therapy and on medication. I am so absolutely terrified of being alone and now I am. It’s like there’s a wall now and even though not much has been said I feel like I can’t talk to them anymore. They don’t really seem to care about keeping a friendship. This is devastating to me because I’ve opened up to them about my trauma and usually turn to them for comfort. I have no other friends. I have no where to go. Because of the thoughts I’m having I know I should go to the ER (been there before, it was very helpful). But it’s finals week and I want to wait until the semester is all the way over to go. I dont know what will happen if I go to the Er, but I do know that I’m not mentally safe right now and I have no clue what to do. I’m so completely alone. And I’m so scared. I need a boost to get through this next week so I can go to a psych ward after finals."
3235,I miss my son...,"I'm going to be 100% honest about something.

The only reason I didn't use my handgun ls back in America (I am back in the UK now, my son is still there) to end my life was because I have to fight for my son.

I'm depressed, without him I spend every day empty and completely at odds with my reasons for staying alive.

I'm alive for him and a chance of seeing him again one day so I can show him the messages where his mother maliciously kept him from me and prove her inevitable lies to him wrong. 

Personally if I lived for myself I'd be fucking dead already."

She told me I've seemed fine.

She told me that because I've kept myself busy, I've been selfish.

Then she told me to go fuck myself.

I've driven to somewhere I feel safe, but the whole way along the motorway I struggled not to swerve off  and wreck.

Not sure what the fuck I'm doing any more."
3238,im this close to the last straw. one more tiny pebble in my path to recovery then im considering to doing it again. im seriously too tired,
3239,It’s getting rough,"I haven’t been forced to be in the presence of a toxic person in a long time. The last time I was, I was a teenager living with my horrible mom. She just had to have a perfect daughter to the point where she was willing to let me die. Now I’m stuck in a similar situation again and I can’t escape. No wonder first responders off themselves so much. Line officers will treat you like shit because they know they’ll get away with it. Reach out for help? “Yeah, we’ll get back to you in 2 weeks.” Thanks. 😞"
3240,One barrier left and it's easy to overcome.,"Hi, 
Little background, 26m PTSD of 19 years, foreigner somewhere, 
Thursday 31st November morning was my regular meeting with my first and only therapist of 10 months when I was almost crying telling her I will do try to suicide in few days, she got serious and called her psychiatric colleague, they convinced me to try the ward for few days (a completely willing ward) then I can quit it, so I quit on Sunday, went back to job last Monday and am getting so depressed and want just quit the whole life, 
What's stressing me now? Just normal life goals, keep my job and don't get fired again (11 months ago), find a GF, read every day for 30 min,,, etc. 

Not much actually connect me to this life , it's only my instinct to live that's keeping me (just like any ordinary animal)

Have a plenty of suicidal thoughts to the point am sure if I let it out every one hear it will be suicidal 

Why do I matter, just ordinary human 1/7Billion others, 

Am so tired of this life can't fall asleep without sleeping medication and fighting with suicidal thoughts, and can't go throw my day without the anxiety and overthinking exhausting me over all the day and my anti depressant medication, 
I can keep going for pages, but what's the difference, am just another suicidal person, all our feelings are the same, 
Last note I really hope there is hell some where so my dad find what he deserves, and I hate you mom for being a silent victim all these years, you should've the courage to say no before you get a 5 kids idiot, 

I can't see the end of this. I can't live with what's in my mind any more :(."
3241,Anyone else been told this?,"Does me being suicidally depressed mean I'm manipulative and take advantage of other's? 

The girl I love (my ex) told me I take advantage of her emotions by not coming to school. Because everyone knows that me and her are close. So everyone always questions her about my wellbeing. And how it is exhausting for her. Because she can't focus on herself. I understand that completely. 

But I literally isolate myself from everyone I care about. So that they don't have to worry about (Even though they do anyway). Because I saw first hand how it affected the one I love most which is her, in our relationship. Like I make sure not to open up or put my problems on anyone. I've attempted suicide a few times in the past. And will do so once more (hopefully successful). But am I manipulative? I do not try to be. I legit isolate myself from everyone I care about. And she told me awhile back. That takes a toll on her. And is manipulative. 

And as I think about my last days on this earth. I just wonder... was I really a manipulative person while alive? 

Ion know it's just confusing. 

It's like I'm dead inside. Yet me being dead inside and how I handle it. Is problematic or manipulative towards others... when in reality. I'm literally a dead man walking. How could I carry the motivation to take advantage of you? When I don't even carry the motivation to live anymore. Or do simple daily tasks. It's confusing.

Does anyone else have that problem? Or have been told that?"
3242,"I’m feeling down, and I just want to sleep forever.",
3243,It's not fair,"Why?! I've been trying so hard! After a month of compeltely isolating myself from everything, I finally had enough strength in me to start trying to get better again. I did so much more than I thought I'd be able to in a couple of days, and now its come crashing down. Every time I'm given a slither of hope, I catch the bait, and then fall right back down to square 1. I'm so tired, I want this to stop so much. I can't kill myself, it feels like a hurdle far too high to jump over right now, but jesus fucking christ do I not want to be alive. I want to go back to before I was born, I want to have never existed in the first place. I was so proud of my pathetic attempt at progress, and now I just feel so overwhelmed again. I just hate when life decides to toss me a little bit of happiness, I was getting used to the bad feelings again, they were horrible, but not nearly as bad as they are now, directly after experiencing the ability to function slightly for the first time in over a month. It's just.. not fair."
3244,I'm really close to just killing myself,I feel so hopeless everyday I've just been getting yelled at and told I'm a failure and I just cant take it I want this to stop I feel so lonely and empty I just want to end it I have no one to talk to I have no one to open up too I cant even complain to others or vent so I'm just stuck here fucking horrible and wanting to just die overnight I get so close to just doing it and I'm not sure how long itll be until I just do it
3245,"Hey, anyone wanna talk?",Been feeling numb for too long
3246,Anybody know easy and quick ways to kill yourself,Just wondering how to kill myself quickly and as painless as possible have been looking into the traditional methods and they seem way to difficult or to painful.
3247,The disabled woman,"Hey all there was a post on here the other day from a woman who had become disabled, felt like a burden and was sitting in a carpark hiding from her partner..  the post is gone and I'm hoping she sees this I just really need to know if she's ok I've been thinking about her. Sorry if this sort of post isn't allowed."
3248,Failure is the most I can manage,"It doesn't seem to matter how hard I try, or how close I get to the goal, I always fall short. Whether by an inch or a million miles. I'm just so tired of pushing and pushing, trying harder, accomplishing more than others and it doesn't seem to matter to the people who make decisions about the quality of my life. 

I don't know what I'm missing, why I am such a fuck up in the eyes of others and why the only worthwhile thing about me is the value I bring to others. The only way people ever give a shit about me is if I'm a benefit to them. I'm just so tired of working so hard to be worth something. Is it unreasonable for me to expect someone to care about me just cause?"
3249,I keep putting suicide death date possibilities. Its marked in my phone. But I'm afraid to hurt my father. My fiancè will get over it and deserves better,"I want to do it now, but it's too close to Christmas. I was thinking of January cause I dont want to taint anyones Valentine's Day or New Years. But idk if I can hold on until march"
3250,I'm so close to doing it,"I want to rid everyone of myself, i just actually attempted harming myself for the first time and just when i thought i was getting better

If i go for a walk now i will find a way to end it, of i stay inside i will continue to argue with the people i love, hurt them verbally and cry my eyes out until morning. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE AND NOBODY TAKES MY CONDITIONS SERIOUSLY.  :(

i will either starve myself until emaciated so they realize that something IS wrong or i will kill myself. But if i do it, then they will blame themselves. I can't take this anymore i can't"
3251,Please say I'm not a monster,"I've disclosed my story of shame to my new therapist, of incestuous experimentation with my twin brother and of the memories of playing doctor as kids .

I've withheld this so long and now I've disclosed it I thought she looked distressed, even though she let me talk overtime.  But her handshake was more abrupt than the first two times and her eyes seemed less cordial than the first two times.

I feel so vulnerable, and I would just need someone to tell me that my childhood is not monstrous, that I'm not a pervert. I cannot wait until the next session, I feel she's got power over me now."
3252,Sometimes I wonder...,"If I actually had access to a gun, would I kill myself?? 

Every time the answer comes back as yes. 

I've imagined every scenario...even gathered detailrd instructions. I know what chrmicals and materials I need in order to use gas. 

I've picked out the parking garage that's close enough, AND high enough. 

I havent got any rope, but I do have a hose that's sturdy and I think would hold my weight. 

Unfortunately I don't have my stock of pills anymore...they failed the one time I tried anyway. Failed miserably. 

Of all my plans tho, I wish I just had a gun...it seems like the quickest, most sure fire way to get the job done. But I always wonder if I could actually pull the trigger given the chance. 

I want to die...but I also understand that my suicidal tendencies come more from me wanting to escape my situation. But there is no escape. There is no better alternative. 

But I'm still here, for some reason. Too chickenshit to jump and probably too dumb to mix the right amount of chemicals. Probably too fat for the hose/noose too. And guns, even if the us, are kind of hard to come by for me. 

So here I am...planning yet again.  Spinning my wheels and paralyzed by indecision and cowardice."
3253,Downer,"Does anyone else feel like they will eventually die by suicide? Like whether it is sooner or later, you just know that it will happen."
3254,Need some advice,"I have been here once before about asking for advice on what to say to the suicide hotline counselors. That did not help at all, so now I want to tell my school counselor. Although, I'm afraid that she will tell me parents. It does not matter to me that she has to report it, I just don't want my parents to know."
3255,"It's gotten even worse, My water supply is going to be cut off, and my cat died","Received today, a notice that if we don't pay the bills we'll be out of water. We still don't have eletricity, even though they were supposed to turn it back on today.

Also, my neighbor called me at my home, said with absolute 0 chills that my cat just died, it was likely run over, he was inside a trashbag, but it looked just like him from what I could see because of the transparency of the bag. Even more reasons to die now! This life hates me so much it's an actual joke"
3256,"OK, WITH THE HOLIDAYS APPROACHING A LOT OF YOU ARE SAD AND DEPRESSED. WITH THAT, ......","I NEED FOUR OF YOU TO TAKE YOUR LIVES THIS WEEK. MY GOAL IS TO GET AT LEAST 5 PEOPLE FOR THE YEAR. GOT ONE, NEED FOUR MORE. YOU ARE USELESS, WORTHLESS AND LIKE THE NIGGER NOT LOVED. SO DO THE RIGHT THING AND END IT TODAY. YOU WILL FEEL GREAT!!! PLEASE FOR JESUS, HE IS OUR LAMB AND HE COMMANDS YOU!!! END IT TODAY! LOVE THE LORD"
3257,Probably gonna do it this week,"I'm just lonely and over it. I can't even keep the interest of people from subreddits that's meant to make friends. I only have 1 friend, and I think she is starting to hate me. Shes never hung out with me outside of school, and is probably more interested in all her other friends. Which is fine of course, not blaming her, I suck haha. I'm scared and don't want to go but im so over being lonely and unwanted. I have a bunch of pills ready."
3258,"Managed to survive this long, but there’s no end in sight","I had a suicide plan set up for last April, but I managed to somehow make it through (with the help of someone who has since stopped caring). It’s like being in a flooded box, though. The box is sealed and just barely large enough to fit you, so you’re sitting and restrained in a dark, claustrophobic space filled with water. You survived this long by holding your breath, but you’ve gone long past your limit, and your lungs are screaming for air. Every second that passes is more agonizing than the last, and the idea of giving up is ever more appealing. Let the water flood into your lungs and it’ll all be over.

Outside, people encourage you to break out of the box. “If you help a butterfly break out of its cocoon, it’ll be too weak to fly,” they say. They cannot see that, inside, the walls of the box are made with reinforced steel. Part of you desperately hopes that someone will come and pry the box open, but can you wait so long for something that might never happen?

And so you continue, holding your breath for far longer than anyone could reasonably do, pushing far beyond your limits with every tortuous moment, hoping for the impossible to occur before you finally succumb to the water."
3259,I think dying is the only way for me to reach peace,"My mum raped me when I was young and tried to kill me   
Youth welfare took me away from home and put me in the children's home   
My parents never gave a shit about me on from this point  
I teached myself programming with 7 years old and I got really good at it   
Still I got homeless and broke and was living on the streets of Berlin where no one believed my story and thus didn't give a shit about it  
The insurance sent a letter where I had to put how much I earn to an address where I didn't live and so they put me on the highest earning rate and gave me massive amounts of debt which I will probably never be able to pay in my whole life  
I had no access to any kind of healthcare for decades and my teeth are completely broken and if I eat anything else than soup I have massive, unbearable physical pain   
I managed to start a company with a ""friend"" and earned over 200k in a year, he ripped me off and took anything away that I earned and put me in even more debt   
I went homeless again   


Everyone I ever trusted, no matter if friends or girlfriends fucked me up in the end, abused me and broke my heart.  


I did never want anything in this life apart from a place to live and food. Absolutely nothing. But life is fucking me over and over and over again. I don't need this shit anymore. Fuck it all."
3260,This will be my last birthday.,It's my birthday today. yay me. Except I know it will be my last. I've been on hold with both the suicide hotline and their chat now for about 30 minutes. I'm currently at work. But I think I'm gonna do something on my way home from work. No one cares. Not even sure why I'm writing this.
3261,I am being checked into the psych ward.,"I am going to the ER to tell them how i feel. I am going to take care of myself. I need some assurance that I'm doing the right thing for myself. Positive reinforcement, y'know."
3262,I can’t do this anymore,Even though I always see other people with depression I envy them since they can at least get through their day without feeling like a pathetic piece of shit. Living is so difficult for me even though I have loving parents I feel like they can’t understand what i’m going through. Even just living is hard let alone going to school. I really just want to end it. This time i’m really gonna try to kill myself no looking back.
3263,This is my last week,"I was doing fine, and then I just sort of... broke. I'm alone. I'll always be alone. After I'm done with finals this week and finally be a graduate, I'm going to just do it. I can't fucking take it anymore. No one cares, nor will anyone ever care. I'm just a fucking nuisance and a burden and a good-for-nothing piece of shit. 

I just wanted to tell someone since I don't have anyone I can talk to. I'm sorry."
3264,I'm am thinking about it at least 3-4 times a day. For about 30mins to 1hour.,I know it's wrong but each day that passes the feeling is getting stronger and I'm starting to lose grip. The hope that I'm holding on is starting to fade and I'm afraid that I will fall.
3265,I don't know how much longer I can survive this world.,I'm trying to survive till after Christmas but it just feels like an impossible task I have a million trust issues because people have screwed me over so many times and I just dont see the point to life if we can't just be honest with the people close to use. Because what's the point of telling them the trust when they will just feed you with lies. But again this could have to do with my self esteem and maybe it's in my head but I really just cant take life anymore their is no more joy just constant misery
3266,I think today's the day,"i've hit rock bottom before, but today i'm looking up how much of each medication/which combinations would be more lethal. i've really tried stayign alive but it's not worth it. I doubt whatever comes after death is worse than the miserable place inside my head. it's to the point that my family isn't even enough to keep me alive..."
3267,i’m so exhausted of living,"all the time. living when you don’t want to is harder than anyone can imagine. these past few days have been hell, i can barely move off the sofa, i have no desire to do anything at all. ive barely eaten or drank water. my eyes can barely stay open. i skipped my therapy appointments because i was too tired and depressed. i’m just waiting for the day i eventually kill myself, and i hope it happens real soon."
3268,I can’t decide whether to leave a note or not,What should I do?
3269,Addicted to opioids,"Fuck my life, I wanna kill myself stay away from this shit people."
3270,Final days,Got my hands on some hard stuff. I can’t do this anymore. Just turned in a final blank. I flunked the whole semester. I’m depressed and have anxiety attacks. I’m just done with this. I can’t wait. See you on the other side. I appreciate the efforts. But I’m just a lost cause.
3271,It’s been one year since I first tried to kill myself,Holy shit time goes by so fast. My life is still so shit.
3272,My Birthday is Wednesday.,"I'm thinking about doing it then. There's just something poetic and kind of beautiful about leaving the world the same day you entered it and it brings me comfort and makes the thought of ending things a lot easier. My whole life has been nothing but turmoil. I live in sorrow and sadness every day and the weight of this never-ending darkness inside of me, after 16 years, has just become too much for me to push down anymore. It's like trying to overfill a hamper full of dirty clothes. Sure you can smash the clothes down and lay something heavy on the lid to keep it from popping open all the way but eventually it's just going to burst at the seams and that's where I'm at now. My seams are bursting and I don't think I'll make it through December. I didn't want to make it through 2019, 18, 17, 16 or 15 but I did and now another year is coming and I'm revisiting my thoughts from other Decembers past and this year I truly think I'm ready to let go. The thought is so satisfying and freeing. I feel like I'm breathing lightly for the first time ever instead of gasping for air everyday like I'm drowning. A smile is literally creeping across my face as I'm writing this and the tense feeling I have in my body and stomach every day of my life has disappeared. I feel so happy and calm and relaxed at this very moment thinking that the end could be just around the corner. Now I didn't come here to be talked off a ledge or to be told to ""drop the knife."" I simply came here to kind of just give my one last goodbye, to put my stamp on here to let everyone know that I'm okay with my decision and to just get it off my chest because I've never talked about it openly. Suicide is not the answer to everyone's situation and it certainly is not an easy or good decision to make but for someone who has LITERALLY, not metaphorically, been to the ended of the Earth and back trying to find peace, love and happiness and had turned up empty handed everytime....well....there's not many cards left on the table to play. So thank you all for the wonderful, WONDERFUL, amazing work you have done here and thank you for trying to help me in the past. You all are all beyond wonderful people and if there is a heaven then you will no doubt have a place high in the sky. Thank you all again. Goodbye. (':"
3273,i dont know what to do.,"hi. im sorry for any mistakes, english isn’t my first language... i’ve never used reddit before, but i was reading some posts on this subreddit and i guess i wanted to also share, because im to much of a pussy to share my feelings with anyone else because i know im just going to annoy them. i used to self-harm, i started in sixth grade and im still doing it. one day clean, yay. i feel stupid and ugly. im failing half of my classes and i have a few weeks before the new semester begins and i know that i won’t be able to bring them up before it starts, so what’s the fucking point? 

my sister tells me to kill myself most of the time. she made fun of me when she saw the cuts on my thighs and she’s always threatening to tell everyone. 

i have a boyfriend, i don’t want to tell him, but i always feel pressured by him. i don’t want him to leave me because “im too scared to have sex.” i usually vent to him, but i know that he’s getting tired of me and my problems. i feel like such a burden. he says he loves me, but is he only with me for sex...? 

i hate seeing my fucking face in the mirror everyday. im tired of my fucking body, i hate the stupid marks i leave on myself, im tired of the marks he leaves on me, im tired of being stupid, im tired of crying, im tired of life. i know that im not going to go anywhere in life, so what’s the point?? i know that im never going to graduate because im dumb as fuck. 

i already wrote a letter to my family. i already have the blade and pills ready. but why am i dreading this? i know i want this, i know im ready to die. but im scared. i just don’t know what to do anymore."
3274,How long would it take to die from stab wounds?,"I plan on doing it probably right after christmas and the plan is to stab myself a few times and wait until i die if I dont wimp out on it. Im just kinda scared about whether id be found out before i died, so if it’d take too long ill probably drive somewhere on the road and do it there in my car."
3275,Losing my mind and seem to only have one way out.,"It's been on my mind a lot.  I just moved back to my home town to help out my family and it's just been kinda shitty.  I'm almost positive my gf is bipolar and for 3 years she has been promising me that she will seek help.  She hasnt and it's starting to take a toll on our relationship.  This morning she blew up on me because our daughter leaked on the bed this morning.  I just woke up and hadnt said anything but started to help. She snapped at me and said no more bottles in the bed and i said ok.  She just kept laying into me about how i never do anything to take care of our daughter which is crazy.  We started arguing and I told her she needs to stop treating me and our daughter like shit over spilled milk( or pee in this case) I'm losing my mind and even though I take my meds regularly it, it doesnt make it easy.  All I think about now is just ending it all.  It doesnt help that she told me to kill myself right before I left tot take my grandad to the dr.  She says I have a bad attitude since I woke but refuses to see how her actions first thing in the morning were absurd.  She feels absolutely no remorse ever for the way she treats both us.  She says she doesnt love me when she is mad even though when she calms down it's the opposite when she calms down.  I'm just sick of this crap."
3276,"If you could press a button and DIE painlessly in one second, would you press the button today or would you wait?",
3277,I'm scared to live past 40.,"I don't know if I want to witness my parents dying. I don't know if I want to be left alone to care for my very autistic brother, not knowing how. And then I don't know what I'd do if I were to die first and then my brother would end up alone. Or vice versa."
3278,"Sorry if this is long or painful to read, but I think I need to talk about my feelings in some form and this is sort of my only way to do it","hi, i really don't know how to begin starting what'll probably be a long thing like this, so i'm sorry if the structure here doesn't read too well. the quickest way of describing my situation is that i'm a recently 18-year-old who finished up high school 8 months ago in a pretty toxic household and i've mostly spent the last couple of months eating pizza and using the internet a lot. when it comes to depression and suicidal thoughts, i'm not actually *entirely* sure where it began with me - for what it's worth, it took about 13 years before i could actually feel that my death would maybe sadden a few people and i still find it kind of weird expressing happiness sincerely because i was so used to being shot down for that when i was a kid, so i was definitely perpetually miserable back then, at least, and most of the motivation i had around that time was from friends who were better than anything i'd had before that. the first time i remember outright feeling like i wanted to die was when i was 12, but it got a lot more serious around when i turned 15 and i attempted suicide several times in 2018 during one of the most guilt-filled times in my life, and i did several more throughout may and june at least of this year.

i feel like there's a lot i have to say before i can really get to where i am now, and not all of it's stuff i'm really comfortable talking about. i will say that i was raised by people who i can't go a single day without being horribly anxious i resemble even physically, who got me diagnosed with a certain label when i was about 8 largely based on things their own fucked-up expectations of me caused, and since then they've pretty much dangled said label over my head and used it to lecture me on my own personality, and between that and a shitton of patronization from them and other adults about it until a few years ago, i've been left with a lot of scars to the point where i honestly end up blocking a lot of people on platforms just because they put it in their bio and it's too painful to even really look at it for me, it's made looking back on the majority of my childhood pretty excruciating because i realize just how much i was lied to out of some belief i was too stupid or incapable, and overall i've stopped associating with that label entirely and honestly stopped even believing in its validity in many cases simply because of how i had it forced on me largely because of traits my own shitty upbringing gave me.

i don't know if you can necessarily imagine the fun of having constant fear and paranoia every time i look a bit off in the mirror or every time i do something that didn't seem planned that i'm either some kind of ""defective"" robot person like they still believe or that i'm instead just like them, but i will say that the resulting identity issues from all of the above were enough that opening up about them once gave a trans friend of mine the confidence to tell me they *were* trans just because our situations and fears were so similar. i also hate my childhood self and general association with my birth name that i don't feel comfortable even writing it down or seeing it, i tend to physically cringe at least a little every time i get called by it, what started as a joke nickname when i was 14 has become the name i outright identify myself with, and the fact i have to use my birth name at all is at least part of why i'm too demotivated to do much in the way of job applications. *(and since i imagine it might sound like it - i've questioned if i'm transgender myself plenty before, literally went to comic con alone in a dress this year and it helped me realize i still feel pretty alright with being a boy, i just feel more comfortable in feminine clothing.)*

so i have a lot of issues with feeling like i'm not something awful, i feel shitty and bad about a lot of ridiculous things like seeming out-of-control in any way *(drunk-related trauma is a big part of that)* which often means even being excited and slipping up a little as a result, or if i exhibit any of the god-knows-how-many things that are ""symptoms"" of that label *(even writing this i'm still worried i'm being verbose in a way that makes it ""easy to tell"", for example)*, the list kinda goes on.

anyway, during an incident early this year the relatives ended up finding out i'd attempted suicide before *(thanks to a long night of pet-sitting where things got so bad i felt that telling someone up-front that with the way they treated me they'd be lucky to even see me alive anymore was the one way to get them to realize the way they treated me was serious)* i ended up getting signed up for therapy. with how so much of the paranoia and trust issues and general hatred of myself in the past decade or so have come from something a professional gave me, i'd always been pretty goddamn apprehensive about actually going to a professional for help.

well, the person i saw helped. a lot. by the time things ended in october, i really wouldn't feel okay calling them ""my therapist"", and i feel like that was mutual to some degree. not really because we were *friends*, but simply because there was a lot of mutual understanding about a very specific kind of identity problem that i think we were both a bit surprised to even find anyone could relate to on such a level. and i don't feel comfortable just calling someone who saw me break down into hysterical laughter after so many sessions of keeping my cool well and write a note on a tissue apologizing for making them see me in that state because i wasn't capable of forming a sentence without breaking down further, and then guessed exactly what i meant when i had mentioned worrying about being a ""defective"", and then confided in me about how that label was something the relative who signed me up made specific mention of expressly against my will, despite how many times i've made it clear to my relatives just how much i hate that label. that isn't something a person who's just there to do their job would do, that's something a person does because they care about the person they're talking to. there was a lot of mutual respect between us, and that's why i really don't feel okay calling them a therapist, because they did a lot more than just a person who has a job would do. they did bring up how it might be a good idea for me to see another therapist once things ended because we both knew i still had a lot of fears and issues, and i said i'd consider it. i have, but i guess they didn't convince me that ""therapists"" are good. they were an amazing person who specifically related a lot with some of my issues and fears, and i don't think a lot of therapists will be able to do that, or will completely disregard that label and not have it affect their assessment of me in any way. by the time we had to part ways they were genuinely excited for me because they really believed, somehow, i was someone who was smart and wise in a way that'd be able to help a lot of people, and the last time i saw them, and probably ever will see them, was them telling me the world needs more people like me, and that was also the first time in years i hugged a person willingly.

i should probably mention that i find it nearly impossible to cry properly anymore - i don't mean just liquid coming out of my eyes, that still happens, i mean with trouble talking and/or tears actually running down my face and stuff - without physically talking in a lot of detail about some of the things i talked with them about. nowadays, i usually just laugh, and i don't even mean laughing hysterically *(which is always how i actually cry when i do and has been for years)*, i just tend to laugh bitterly now when i feel a lot of grief. but walking out of the building after hugging them for the first and last time was the first time in a long time that it didn't take speaking to make me cry properly. i still honestly don't feel entirely okay looking at the pair of joggies i remember wearing to most of the sessions with them because it just reminds me of that day and that moment and how safe i felt with them and how it was the first time in nearly a decade i'd had to part with someone permanently, let alone someone i was on *good* terms with. honestly, the fact they believed in me has been the main that's stopped me from actually trying to kill myself since the start of october, the one thing that's given me the resolve to actually keep all of my emotions in and stay strong to be there for few online friends who i can give support to and not talk about feeling suicidal to anyone i know, even just online, since.

but i'm still in this house.

even with their belief in me, i still just feel cowardly, and useless, and weak, and there's no-one else i can talk to about my problems in the way i talked to them. i'm so, so scared of becoming dependent on anyone because that's what happened to the online friends i grew too close to before, and i've fully adopted a clown facade online just so i can look jolly and okay and keep my friends from feeling down. i still think about things like how i'm not in university or even college or with a job yet and how i'm being a lazy ass and living under the roof of the people who patronized me throughout my childhood and already see me as incapable. i still think about how i don't think i really have any useful talent that'd help anyone i care about. i've fallen down so many times already and i just feel like i'm headed down the same road as my relatives no matter what. i try so hard to act happy and energetic and fun and like some idiot clown god person online nowadays so my friends don't worry and even then i don't feel like i can make them happy. and i've had a lot of fun in the last couple of months. i went to comic-con and other places filled with people with my kinds of interests it was honestly hard to even believe *existed* where i am, and it was so much fun and i felt so alive and excited and free for once in my life, but every time i come back home from that i just feel so far away from everything important to me. i just feel trapped in this stupid, stupid house with these stupid, stupid people when everyone and everything i've loved is too far away for me to see it every day and almost all my communication is through text. maybe i'm just a lazy asshole, but i honestly just don't care about my own survival to the point where i've barely ever cared about going to university or getting a degree or generally doing anything that'll help me live better.

i think one of the most painful things i've realized in the past year is that i'm a lot more cheerful and optimistic than i ever thought i was, let alone anyone else, and i never realized because i've spent so much of my life feeling so alone and horrible and stressed and being snapped at for being happy about anything that i've just adapted to being miserable and poker-faced and quiet and even meaner than i want to be, and it makes *every* time i get to feel safe or excited or cute or anything positive hurt because it's just so *jarring* going back from that to having to live like this, being alone and in pain long enough that it starts feeling like nobody could ever feel happy with me or that i could ever do much for anyone. it hurt so, so fucking much hugging that person the final time i saw them because it'd been so long since i'd felt that kind of warmth, and it was the first time in my entire life i was hugging and being hugged someone who had seen me be *genuine*, and didn't have some false idea of who i am they projected on me, and who i didn't know deep down would hate me if they knew me better. it was the first time someone who i cared about and who cared about me back hugged me and it messed me up so badly that i couldn't keep my composure up after walking away, even when i wasn't in private.

and i should feel motivated by that. a lot of the time i do. but then a lot of the time just makes me wish i was dead because it'd be better wherever i'm going to go after that than it is just being here, being in this constant despairing state knowing there's something better out there. it's true i'm not doing much. it's true i'm probably a lazy ass. but every time people try and encourage you to do more, it's the same tired shit, the same speeches and Toughen Up garbage about how everyone works and it's just how the world works. i get that. i'm not afraid of working. i've just never been able to feel like there's stuff worth working to survive for long enough. the main reasons i'm still here are that i've had people who've believed in me in the years where suicide's been a constant consideration. most of them were people i only communicated with through text and things ended up falling apart with because i was a mess, and just a bunch of text was not and could never be enough to help for long with everything else going on.

there's people i really look up to and want to be like and who've inspired me or been kind to me. the lper chuggaaconroy is someone who's inspired me since i was a kid and who i love spouting off trivia or goofy jokes like, both my rmps teachers in high school were some of the coolest people i think i'll ever meet in different ways and both of them influenced my entire persona i put up around friends or online a ton and helped me fall in love with the subject, i could probably go on for ages listing people i honestly look up to and who've influenced the way i present myself more than i could say. but when i think of these people i just think how far i am from being *anything* like them and how little work it feels like i've ever put into anything and it just makes me hate myself even more. even seeing people mention work ethic makes me feel like a piece of shit because of how little i've ever had. and i want to say that when it's people or things i love and care about involved, i want to put work in, and the fact i've mostly only had opportunities to do things for myself or people i don't want much to do with just makes it seem otherwise. that's true. but then it wraps around to me feeling like i barely have any skill, either. if i lived anywhere near my friends, i'd love to make them food. i love making sprites or art for the very few people who've ever either wanted it or who i've been able to do it for without feeling like i'm a creep. i know a streamer who's played mario maker a few times and my levels usually end up being the biggest challenge for him and entertaining him and the others who see it, and that motivated me to make more levels knowing he was going to stream again. things like that, knowing it'll make people actually feel better in any way, knowing maybe on a bad day it'd help brighten things a little for them, give me so much motivation do things. but the opportunities are so few and far between that i end up pretty out-of-practice, i end up outclassed by so many people who are just better and i just hate myself more. i like thinking about the idea of being in a loving relationship with someone i can actually see and be seen by and talk to and do things with that make us happy. but then i think about how i can't cook well like other people i've known, or i can't knit them things, or i can't do so many things it just feels like people i've known can and i feel like i'll end up just being like maybe the person i'm most scared of being like, and i'll be some idiot house husband who doesn't do anything and never has anything worthwhile to contribute living off the funds of someone who deserves so, so much better and i want to die all over again.

and considering i'm in a situation where i've backed out of suicide at times or stopped writing a letter because i know if i die, i'll be mourned by people who've never seen me as me, who'll mourn me as some kind of defective thing they think they love, and that hurts enough that it's kept me from going through with it before. it hurts enough that i've still not done it, but i honestly don't know how much longer it'll be able to, and in moments like these i feel a lot number to it.

i'm sorry this isn't nice to read and that it's so long. but i don't want to make people who actually know me know just how miserable i really am because that's always just ended up dragging them down with me and there's a lot of people i feel i need to be strong for *(for the record i know how that isn't healthy - but i've let my guard down too much around people in some places online for years and it just makes me pathetic, i'm not saying this as someone who's always been strong everywhere)*, and i need to vent this somewhere where someone will at least see it, and maybe be able to at connect or say something. thanks for reading this."
3279,[Update] I just overdosed,"The other day, I tried to overdose. Click my bio for the deets. Too lazy to link here. 

Anyway, in the time since, I’ve decided that whatever powers that be obviously didn’t want me dead yet. So I decided to change. 

I’m talking to people. Making friends. I blocked my ex out of my life completely, after realizing that she wasn’t the best person to me either. I moved out of the house to live with my friends who are supporting me through this. While I pay off debts and enroll into school. I won’t make the same mistakes I did with her. I will be a better person. But I won’t do it for her. I’ll do it for me. 

I’m going to crawl my way out of this hole. And some nights, it hurts. Sometimes my anxiety gets to me. I’m starting to rely on alcohol to calm my nerves, so I have to watch that. I’m struggling with the desire to want someone, although deep down I know that I have to work on myself first before I could make anyone happy. The path isn’t easy. I know I’ll stumble sometimes. 

But for the first time in so long, I feel hope. Not because my life is turning around, but because I feel like I want to take steps to improve it. And improve myself. And find someone who will be worthy of the new me. It may take a while, but I have a while left to go. 

I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life. But I can’t look back now and break. I have to march forward. Why? I don’t know. But I want to. I will. And that’s all that matters. 

I’m glad that I accidentally took urinary tract relief pills in an extremely bad attempt to kill myself."
3280,I have no reason to live,"My girlfriend dumped me and I know I won't find another, I have no future and I'm slowly failing my scholarship, I'm never happy, I have no ambition and no hobby, I literally have no reason to live."

I know the noose will hold because iv already tried from my ceiling but the screws came out and I just ended up unconscious on the floor.

3285,"This sub is pathetic. Just another fake, bullshit, soft, and idiotic sub some uncle made so they can feel like they did something cool that they can tell mommy.

3286,The Last Hope,"After looking at this page for so long, it’s surreal to me that I’m writing on here. But I guess this is what it’s for (can’t talk anywhere else otherwise they’ll lock me up :) )
I’ve had attempts in the past, all half-assed, never really intending to die. The only thing keeping me alive right now is the hope that I get into my dream school; it’s very selective and decisions come out this Friday. It would be a huge win for me. Due to the extremely competitive nature of the university, chances are high that I won’t get in. Anyway, if things don’t go my way, I’m gonna peace out (have been planning it for a while). It’s not even about the school itself as much as it is about finally getting a win, some reward for my suffering, some validation of my hope for the future. 

Let me know your thoughts."
3287,"Need help, suicidal thoughts are getting stronger by the day","Hi all,

I'm an 24 year old, burnt out/depressed for a long time and don't know how to get out of it. My body is tearing itself down, I'm in real physical pain daily. I've become lazy and tired as fuck, always was very fit and (over) active for someone with epilepsy. After a failed brain surgery I couldn't get back up and things started going downhill, fast. I went in therapy, I was myself again. Second surgery, failed again. I gave up on everything and had weird bodily sensations everywhere I came. Doctor's, neuro and Psych all think it's anxiety. After some attempts to get back to work again I gave up on my friends, everything was let down and it's like I was fighting with everyone who tried to help me to cover up my sadness.
Summer passed, got more lazy, spend a lot of time in bed. I've tried to get back up a lot of times, getting more and more tired as I tried. Changed meds and then my thoughts were, different. I just wanted to kill myself, for what was this life of suffering worth it? 

Time has passed, neuro has took of the med that made me real depressed in the first place. Physically im weaker than ever. My back is in pain, my breath smells like death, my legs are thin and shaky and I'm cold and tired all the time.
I can still enjoy music and the sunrise, but the condition of my body and the work I'd have to do to get back to the old me just wants to kill myself, the plans are already made and my head is made farewell notes :""(. I'm getting weaker by the day, what should I do?

Please, help me. My psychologist starts treating me in January, but I think a Psychiatrist is a better option for me."
3288,Chronic Pain &amp; No Will,"The thought of going peacefully to sleep and never waking again up makes me feel so warm and nice. I have so much debt, I have so much arthritis and tension headaches and pain. I have hardly any family. I have no one who cares about my wellbeing. My therapist can’t understand, doctors can’t understand, the few friends I have don’t truly know how bad I am doing. I have been fighting this severe anxiety and depression and trauma for ten or more years. I am young and I feel very old. I believe I am ready to take my own life, I would like to know the easiest and most painless way to be successful with this."
3289,Too much,"Well I think I'm at the end of my rope,I'm a hopeful dude normally but this is just way too much.

I worked everyday for 4 years and still I'm broke(fractured my ankle  in 3 places at the start of the year and that really ate away at my savings because I couldn't work and had to live off my emergency cash.

Tldr: got delt a few bad hands now I'm done.

Honestly I'm not even sad at this point just so numb
Even my own family want nothing to do with me
Dont got friends close enough I can stay with
Immmmmm done like I dont see it getting much better and even if it did get a little better the monotony of work and life seems too overwhelming
I know people think it's a cowards way out but I honestly cant keep going like this"

I’m still incredibly done and ready to throw in the towel, but I wanted to get a shower as I have been in my car for three days now and feel disgusting. I don’t want to talk to cops or anyone. I know what happens after that and I absolutely will NOT be forced into a hospital for three days of suicide watch and a 20k bill. I know what my problems are and a hospital can’t fix them. I wish people would mind their own business because nobody who is so concerned right now has ever or is ever going to help the actual problems. I’m not obligated to stay alive because they want me to, and I’m sure as shit not going to be forced into a BS mental health facility. I’m not mentally ill, I am exhausTed, isolated and have no solutions left. I have already used 211. I have been to therapy. I have done a ton of things to improve my life but I am only one person and I don’t have any fight left. Now I apparently can’t even go home if I want to. Fuck, man. I just want my decision to be respected."

3295,Family broke up im tempted to end it all,"Im only 17 from philippines and dont know what to do

backstory 

My parents divorces when i was 2 and I have been living with my mom ever since. Life was ok for a while 
until my sister dropped out of college (she was able to get into the top college of the Philippines which has free tuition). This started to cause her and my mom to fight a lot (fights that last for months where no one talks to each other). Recently my mother and sister had a fight about whether she would go back to school or not and now my mother is about to move away, she told me to forget i ever had a mother. 

now 

Right before i was about to sleep my mother told me about how she was giving up on raising me and my sister. I think i can understand why, my sister was a star student in highschool and just suddenly dropped out of college while I (17M) only recently started college and am only doing average (im failing 1 class). So i donnt blame her for giving up on me and my sister, but i feel like she gave up on me too quickly.

She is packing her things right now and i dont know what to do

 i tried to talk to my sister what to do about it and she told me to go fuck mysyelf"
3296,thursday will be the day,"I'm gonna fail this uni year again so there is literally no point in continuing. I hoped that I could do a good semester so I could change uni next year but loneliness and uninterest made me miss almost every classes. I have an exam in 1 hour and after having 2 semesters about that, I still know nothing about the subject so I'm gonna have 0/20. I'm gonna have 0/20 and 5/20 in two subjects/units. I need to have at least 10/20 in both semester to validate my year and I'm gonna get something like 4/20 this semester. I have no one in my life so I wanted to change uni and make new friends in a larger city but no uni will accept someone who missed almost every classes and exam for 2 years. I'm just wasting my time. Goodbye."
3297,I'm doing that thing where I research means of suicide again.,"I have this strong urge to drive to a state with lax gun laws so I can end this shit. it's finals week rn and I'm realising now that I may lose my scholarship which means going into thousands of debt or dropping out. and if I stopped out, I'd have nothing. I wouldn't have anything else for me in this world and I'd be ready to die."
3298,Help me die,"I want to commit suicide. 

Can someone help me with the most effective way? I have no access to a gun or poison. I however could make arrangements to pay for it if I'd ever met someone who would offer me such things. I am in Durban KZN"
3299,"For the last three years I’ve said I’ll kill myself around December 2019-January 2020 if I hadn’t found a reason to live. Now that the time is here, I have more reasons to commit suicide than ever",I’m just trying to find motivation to go through with it along with a method and then I’m out of here
3300,"How come every time I post here, no one cares?","That’s how I know the world is just telling me to die. If I tell people I need help, no one answers. Now I just need to find the quickest way to die. I’m probably not gonna last till the end of this week."
3301,Lost and want to die,"I’ve completely ruined my life and everything that’s good in it due to my own stupid fucking behaviour I’m losing the love of my life and my job and I just want to die, I’m being a burden on my family because I can’t stop crying and I need people around me right now. I can’t eat hardly anything without throwing up or needing the toilet I’m a fucking wreck I can’t cope with this feeling anymore I’m so alone and fucked I don’t care about myself anymore"
3302,How should I commit suicide?,"I’ve decided to kill myself and end my worthless life. But I don’t own a gun and couldn’t get one, so I have to find another way to commit suicide. I don’t want to suffer much pain in my death; I want to die quickly and as painless as possible. Any suggestions?"
3303,What if the pain ISNT temporary?,"What if you have multiple chronic physical excruciatingly painful diseases that are incurable, lifelong, and worsen with age? And the ONLY way to stop it is to die. Just curious. Thanks."
3304,My brain is a prison,"My brain does not turn off and I cannot live like this anymore. It’s been many months of absolute agony and trying to fight the temptation to die. But all i think about is bowing my brain out. It does not turn off and I want to die. I cannot be here. There’s a lot of things going on with my family so it would be extremely selfish to kill myself, but I cannot be in this much pain anymore."
3305,My life is falling apart.,I’m a struggling high school sophomore who currently does not know what to do with themselves. I used to be a straight-A student with a close-knit group of friends and now I have nothing. I don’t know what happened. I distanced myself from everyone who cared about me and now even my parents have given up on me. My grades are dropping because I’m not motivated and don’t study at all. I resent everyone around me because they’re all thriving and that makes me hate myself more. I honestly believe the only option now is to quit but I’m too much of a coward to do anything. Where do I go from here?
3306,Depression eats away,"I feel like I’m wasting my life. I am depressed and I never felt this way before in my entire life. I know what depression is, and how to get over it. But, these days are harder than anything I’ve faced before... I’m so disappointed in life itself in my life and in others. The first step should be to look at myself but, nothing changes even if I tried. I try to not hate the people but love them even my enemies I share my love with. What got me into this position is, are several factors: my dad comitted suicide. I knew his reasons and he couldn’t fight it anymore. I’m not gonna go to much in his reasonings but I can say I am proud to be his son. Even though I miss him a lot. Second of all I’m frightened to go to school now. I don’t go anymore. I’m bullied by people who are spreading false rumours, I only have 1 actual friend and he’s not always in my class. Then I met someone who I thought could give me hope and meaning to my life. But that seemed to be a false factor. She was dating someone else while she was dating me. Got married soon after we broke up. She dated a guy who was spreading rumours about me. Hence the reason I don’t want to go anymore. Another thing is happening to me, and I have yet to see a neurologist about it, but I have something similar to Parkin sons disease. I honestly just want to give up. I know I promised my dad to make it through this year, but by all means I would if my life wasn’t in such a state. I either just want to die now, or fuck it all up by going into an insanity frame. I just don’t know what to do anymore."
3307,So very unmotivated to do good,"I’m so unmotivated by everything. I can’t get myself to study even. I’m 18, I want to do good in school, I want to get into a good university, but fuck. I get bad grades and I can’t do shit in math. The only coarses I’m good at are the things I’m interested in (history, etc); even there I get bad grades. I have loads of free time— why can’t I get myself to do good in school even then? I feel like my family hates me, and I don’t deserve a good life. I see no future for myself. I really fucking hate myself. I want everything to end."
3308,My brain is a prison,"I cannot turn off my brain, it is a prison. It is driving me to insanity. I started making some arrangements to off myself then some crazy family stuff happened. If I kill myself now it would be extremely selfish considering all of what is going on. Fuck my life. My body is a cage and i need to get out of here."
3309,I don't want to die but feel like I'm in an inescapable situation.,"School, am I right? Haha. No, seriously. I don't want to die. At all. I'm in the U.S. I'm a transgirl/enby (she/her pronouns). That puts pressure on me, but luckily for that I'm in a supportive environment. There's actually a lot to be appreciative of. I feel bad about being so privileged, to be honest. I feel guilty for ever feeling happy. I love the social environment of my school. But my grades are dropping and dropping and dropping. I'm in a special program, so I'm not zoned for the school I'm at, and if my grades drop below a certain point, I will get kicked out and have to go to a different school, which is WAY fucking worse. I know what I want to do with my life. I won't get into specifics because it does involve activism, but mainly helping people and community service and whatnot and just making the world a better place. But there's this pressure to be successful all the time. That I have to be good enough. That if I don't go to a good college, that if I don't get good enough grades, I won't ever succeed in life. I don't know what to do. And I can't DM anyone here because my parents monitor literally everything I type, and so I can only write this shit at school."
3310,kill me,
3311,I’m barely hanging on,"My mental state is so weak and school stresses me out so much. I was never cut out for university. Im in finals week but I just stay up all night crying and all I can think about is ending it. 

I already had a very low mental state of mind before starting school, and I knew I was prone to being suicidal easily but now I don’t think I can hang on anymore. 

I’m scared of going to school tomorrow because I am not good enough academically and I have a group project where I’m the last person to submit stuff for and I know I don’t have quality work even though I tried so hard... I’m just so stressed...and sad and I’m feeling so suicidal now.

I don’t really have anyone to speak to in my life. I tried talking to my boyfriend but he just doesn’t understand me, it’s hard to just “get better” or “stop feeling like that”.. When you’re so low no one really understands unless they’ve been there."

They keep saying dying of cervical cancer is horrible but I dont care. I would rather die in a shitty apartment then out on the streets. I cannot believe medical costs are like this. I hate America. I dont have the money to move. I wonder if other countries will take me as a refugee. 
I figure once the cancer gets bad I'll just rack up the rest of the money I have left on my credit cards and live it the fuck up and then blow my brains out. 
I hate America and after 33 years of living here I will kill myself because of this stupid country. It's bad enough there is no mental health care but now I have to be in debt over cancer. 
I HAVE AND PAY FOR INSURANCE 
Fuck america and I cant wait to die"
3320,Rejection and loneliness has turned my life downhill. TLDR in the bottom.,"Sorry if I’m not good on my sentences. I can speak pretty fluently but not as much in typing.

Hi, I’m 17 and have no one to talk to now so I thought I could get some help here. Just to start from the beginning, I’ve been through a lot of physical abuse from my brother from the past. But before that we were pretty much looking out for each other until he moved onto a video game called ‘Realm of the Mad God’. We had a lot of fun commenting on each other’s play style until he found a guild that became his friends. Since we had one computer to share with, we would take turns but soon later he would just take it all for himself and my father lend me his laptop for me to play. I found out that he’s been talking shit about me with his friends online and that would only get them to message me some horrible crap that at first I ignored it but it started to get into my head. The moment I knew my brother gave up on me was when he started to abuse me for things like accidentally dying on his character, etc. I was afraid on telling my parents about this since I know I would probably get more hurt from him. Eventually, they found out for themselves and proposed that we should both leave each other alone. Thing is was that I never really talk a lot towards my parents or anyone else really, just my brother. As you can tell this move made me really lonely. 

In school, I was pretty much the outcast. I wouldn’t talk to anyone and no one seemed to care back. But I was a great student who would reach over 90%. 

Later on, I met a transgender woman online. First time I had heard her voice just made me fall in love. It was a rocky start on getting to know her as she really didn’t like talking to people, but once she got to know me we set up to be best friends. We’d play a lot of different video games and discuss about different topics. Sooner or later, I found out that she has been suffering from depression so I talked it out with her about how she feels and what antidepressants she took. I talked about my life and how bad it has gotten until I met her. Couple months have passed and I soon revealed that I had feelings for her and she responded that she couldn’t return my affections for her back. But we talked about it and we both agreed on a date when we eventually see each other in real life. A few days have gone by and she revealed that she’s a lesbian which really made me upset. I was was upset as that I got rejected as well as that the realization no one really cares about me and that I have no future. This turned me to giving up on school and stay home playing video games to ease my mind. I talked to her a day later and settled on being best friends but I was still in love with her. I was planning on changing my gender a couple weeks ago until now so that I could experience what it’s like being a woman and also have the chance on dating her once more. Last night, I talked to her about it but she rejected me once as that she thinks that it wouldn’t really work out and that I don’t have anything ‘special’. After hearing that, I left the call and planned to run away or cut away my brain or heart. I just feel more lonely than ever before having no future. I thought she could turn my life around as I know that I couldn’t find anyone else like her ever.

TLDR- I was very social around my brother until he turned onto me by his friends on line that really fucked with my mind. Sooner or later I met a trans woman that I fell in love with which we became best friends until I soon revealed my feelings for, and we agreed on a date but she said that she’s a lesbian. I felt so depressed that I gave up on school and left off on playing my own computer, but we agreed once more that we could stay as best friends but I was still in love with her and planned on changing my gender to have a new experience and asking again if we could date once more. Again, she rejected me by saying that it wouldn’t work out and that I had nothing special about myself which I know isn’t true but it fucked with my head even further and I just want to end my life, knowing that no one really cares about me and that I have no future ahead of me other than being lonely."

3322,If I ever were to suicide it would be to this song (maybe the entire album if time allows it), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5CVsCnxyXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5CVsCnxyXg)
3323,"My depression just keeps coming back. Whenever I dare to believe that it's going to go away it come right back and hits me. Why go on living if everytime I think things will get better, they just get worse?","I wish that I could cut every inch of my body to distract me from the constant worry that I'm always going to be like this and that I'll constantly be hurting the people around me. I just want to end it all, I feel like the only escape is killing myself"
3324,I recorded my thoughts during a particularly low moment. Don't know what I'm hoping to achieve by sharing this,Here's the link. https://clyp.it/yisbtxuj
3325,I don't know what to do anymore,"I have 2 friends (1 really) and an alcoholic stepfather. My friends are oceans away and I live with my stepfather in a country that I loathe and do not know how to get out of.

I'm been here since I was born and more than anything, I was to leave this hellhole. But I can't. I dropped out of high school because of what I later learned was probably my depression and anxiety acting up. Homeschooling only heightened both and I didn't know that was the case, I just thought I was a worthless failure. 

Several years later, I finally meet a friend online who suggests that I might be suffering from depression. I get directed to a phyciatrist and I'm diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I get pills, they don't work. It takes 2 years to find something that helps. I think I can finally start living my life. 

I can't. Because as much as my internal self is medicated, I'm still left with an non-supportive stepfather who pays all the bills so I can't say shit, can I? What right do I have? Oh, and I'm still living in a shithole. It's great. 

So a couple more years down the line and I'm not feeling any brighter. My mind is clearer and now I can think about all of my failings in greater detail. About all my shortcomings, about how I'm absolutely fucking useless and I only have myself to blame. People say the only way to change things is through action and I try — I finally get to a place mentally where I can think clearly enough to start working on a GED because my anxiety doesn't flare up as quickly. I start trying to look for jobs. I start trying to get out of this country I loathe so much and away from the person in my life that brings me the most fucking stress and misery. 

But every step of the way, I'm blocked. I'm blocked by the fact that I can't get a job until I've completed my GED. And after that, no one is going to want to take in a GED with no work experience. Especially not from the hellhole I'm from. 

I'm blocked by the fact that I don't have any money anymore because all of it has been used up to pay for bills and pleasures my step-father wants. I can't say no because what if he kicks me out? I can't say no because this is the house I live in and I can't go anywhere else, of course I have to pay to be able to keep the lights on and be able to speak for \~4 hours a day to the one person that doesn't make me feel like shit. He's been providing financially my whole life, who the fuck am I to speak up against him? Who am I to get angry about the fact that we're only in debt because his smoking and drinking habits drove us into the ground while he remained unsupportive of the idea of me getting a job and just kept lying to me that finances were okay and I had nothing to worry about so I should just keep sitting on my ass and being worthless because that's okay.

So of course I fucking did. I wasn't on my meds yet, any reassurance that I wasn't a broken, fucked up, good for nothing child was appreciated. It helped me get through the months with only 1 guaranteed breakdown per week. It felt like support, so I took it. Because I'm a damn idiot. GG me.

But now I have all of these things I need to achieve in front of me and I'm running out of time. This shithole isn't getting any better and if the only working person in this household died, I'd be left with nothing, so time is running out. 

What's the point?

I can't do this. I struggle to even try most days. I always talk myself out of shit and whenever I start something, I just can't finish because I doubt myself and my abilities. I feel so worthless and I feel hopeless. I live day to day failing and self-loathing and looking forward to 10 minute dopamine rushes to get me through the entire day. Not even my hobbies bring me much joy unless I'm lucky enough to have an okay day. Because days are never good anymore. Just okay. That's the best that I can muster. 

I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired. I'm clinging on for people who will be fine when I'm gone — I die and they grieve but they've got the support system I wish I had and the job I wish I had and the opportunities I wish I wasn't too chicken shit to strive for. Why am I hanging on for them when I fucking do is remind them about my shit life and make their days and weeks worse because everyday there's something I had about my life that I can't keep in otherwise I'll go crazy and they have to sit there and read it all and feel sorry for me and waste energy on trying to give me support when it all washes off my back even as I read it.

I'm so empty. 

I feel like I'm too fucked to make anything work anymore. I keep going back to suicide again and again, I have been for years, but then I'll think that maybe I should try. So I do and I end up back to step one, with all of these expectations of myself that I will never be able to reach while a ticking time bomb sits behind me, reminding me that if I make one wrong move, that's it. Game over. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I want happiness. I want to be happy. I want to be able to speak to my friends and be with them and see them be happy. I want to have hope. I want to keep trying, I want to start fucking succeeding but I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what to do anymore. 

Nothing I do feels like enough. Whatever glimpses of happiness I find are overshadowed by all the negatives staring down at me. I don't want to end it but it feels like I have to. Because what's the point? Why am I here? Why must I keep suffering like this? 

I feel like I can't keep doing this anymore. Fuck."
3326,Seeking Help,"Hi. So I've been having the worst month of my life. I broke up with my ex early November and it's really caused me to go downhill. We were only together for a year but I knew she was the one. We broke up over a stupid argument that elevated and know she wants to be by herself.

Fast forward a month and I've been depressed. Nothing I do can make me forget her at any time or point. She's stuck in my head and many people will say it'll go over time and it will get better, but when I knew she was everything to me I don't believe it will. I never wanted a relationship before her and she is one of few people that made me feel like me. Now that's gone and all I see is black and white. I feel so lonely. I'm an introvert, many of my friends have been great to me but everyone is busy so I can't even see them often.

I'm dreading Christmas without her and although I'm still talking to her a bit you can tell she's disinterested in me. Every message is blunt and it's hard work talking to her. But I can't move on. It makes me happier messaging her. Everynight I dream about her just before I wake up and then it just hits me when I do wake up.

I've had many suicidal thoughts this past few weeks, and if I didn't have such a great family I probably wouldn't be here today. I'm really not sure if I can move forward without this woman in my life. I did everything for her and she said I'd never have to lose her, but here we are. I treated her like a queen. I'm a nice guy, I'm very caring and she's just f'ed me over. I have a great job with good pay lined up after University and I don't even want that anymore. Part of me wants to start a new life but I don't know how.

I'm not really sure what to do because I don't want my Life to go on further, but I couldn't do that to my family."
3327,Well this might not end well,"Well here it goes... The ""DUMP"".

I lost my job, the only fucking thing that gives me some sort of satisfaction and happiness. I knew I would never amount to anything(and the problem sense 14), but this tiny horseshit job gave me the tools I needed (with the help of a roof) to LIVE -- and maybe not live incredibly happily -- but generally speaking not sad at all.  
I know where I've been before and im absolutely terrified to be in the same place... I do not think I will crawl out of another dark whole if I allow(?) it to get there.  
IM FUCKING SCARED DUDE... I'm not even depressed, just scared of being that way again with little to no money to get me by.

You might just say get another job. OK FINE.... but when I worked at a dog kennel I threw up everyday before work, and that's just a PHYSICAL limitation of my anxiety, the rest is useless to try to make you understand cause(mental anxiety vs physical -- im just pointing out for it to get physical its gotta be extreme, or atleast for me). I wanted to fucking kill myself everyday and everynight I got home. EVERYDAY. ITS NOT AN OPTION. ITS NOT. I DONT WANT TO DIE -- IM NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

I guess im glad im mainly just terrified currently of being in that place again, instead of BEING THERE.... But I feel like that line can be incredibly blurry

Poorly written and confusing but I suppose we all are when emotional? Thanks for listening -- hopefully this helps me understand SOMETHING abit more...

No meds, no health insurance. No income as of 2 weeks ago, wallet about empty. Severe social anxiety/shame of myself. I have no idea where this will end, but im terrified.  


No idea what im looking to get out of this... but I guess its help. even though that's... non existant"
3328,My note,"I tried to emphasize 
My pain inside 
You couldn't empathize 
Tonight it dies


I've tried talking. No one takes me seriously. My failures and shortcomings are overwhelming and I can see them building up. I just want to stop collecting debt motivationally. I spend so much time ignoring my feelings and trying to move forward. I cant do this. I'm sorry I couldn't live up to the expectations. I'm sorry for the pain I cause. If I could take back my existence peacefully I would. I love you mom. I love you Haven."
3329,"Gonna do it tonight, fuck the world.","13/M I hate everyone, no one loves me and everyones so fucking mean. i cant take this anymore schools so hard and my parents wont care if i die. im ready to go, i hope nothing stops me."
3330,I feel like absolute shit.,"I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, I can’t afford to move away from my annoying dad, and the rude admins over at r/batman keep banning me when I didn’t even do anything. 

I just want to end it all."
3331,I can’t stop thinking of sucide like I won’t do anything I just want it out of my head,So I get rly depressed Around this time of year and then on top of t my boyfriend said he wanted a break and not talk to me for who knows how long and proply will end it with me for good ugh I’m just so sad I felt okay with him and now I don’t have him I feel so empty and I just don’t want to feel this way anymore;(
3332,Another sleepless night,"Its around 5am and I’m waiting for the mixture of sleeping pills and alcohol to take effect and relieve me from my thoughts another sleepless night. 

The career I wanted to flesh out is more difficult to reach now, but the worse thing is the fear of still feeling that dread. Daydreaming of having it and still being plagued by a feeling of wanting to throw it away and being unhappy anyways. It seems no change of situation can change that it’s always there, just suppressed sometimes.

What’s a job anyways? Tons of people have jobs that are just a living, so they pursue what they want outside that. But it’s still a huge chunk of their life and  if there’s nothing you want outside of it. It all seems redundant. All my friends talk about having kids, but I don’t want more mouths to feed. I don’t want anybody else to worry about. Kids aside I don’t want another partner either. I’m afraid I’m a liar because I’ll stop loving them. And then I don’t want them. I don’t want it.

The purpose of life is to struggle and enjoy. Journey or destination to be corny. But I don’t care about any of it. Struggle is still struggle and all too often I just wanna call it a day and go to sleep. And stay asleep. Forever."
3333,Killing Myself,"After a bunch of misdiagnosis, I think it's finally time to end it all. The only thing I've definitely been diagnosed with is depression and anxiety (and they won't give me meds because they worry I'll get dependant on them) but for a while there were others. First I had schizophrenia, then I didn't.  Then I had psychosis, then I didn't. Then I had bipolar, then I didn't. It's kinda left me fucked up and wondering what I have and what I don't. It's bs in my opinion and I'm sick of it. I wanna kill myself.

At this point I've racked up three attempts on my life - all by overdosing. The first time I (in a way) got too scared to take a full OD, and, while it was way over the recommended dose, it wasn't enough.

The second time I took more and it left me vomiting for days. Still not enough to kill me.

The third and most recent time I took a shit ton of tablets. No one really knows how I didn't die but I didn't. I was left vomiting blood so that was fun.

I think it's time to finally stop beating around the bush. To actually kill myself this time. I'm so worried about everything at the moment. I'm worried about hurting someone - I have in the past. I'm worried about how my family perceive me. They found out about my issues and they flipped, constantly asking my folks why I was so messed up, stopping me from seeing other family members and never really accepting me after that. Plus just so much more utter bullshit.

I'm sorry if this was long. This is more of a vent than anything else I guess. If you read it, thanks for taking the time to."
3334,Please someone help me.,"I’m [18]m and thought of suicide hasn’t sounded so good because I’m just a burden to everyone in my house because  I lost my job and I’m not going to college currently and parents think I’m a fuck up and the tell me that all the time, also it just makes my depression worse because I’m very sensitive and everything fucked up they say to me hurts a lot more and also I’m overweight so they’re always making fun of my weight. I also don’t have any friends to talk to so it’s just me and I don’t wanna be alone anymore because I’m scared of it getting to the point of me killing myself  this month. Just please I just really want to talk to someone that can help me before it’s too late."
3335,I can't kill myself because of my family,"I got very close to committing suicide yesterday but couldn't do it when I realised that the people who have put me in this painful situation won't even know I'm gone, but it'll affect my family and hurt them so much. They'll pay the price of my pain that has been caused to me by other people like my ex boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in so much pain but I dunno how to just kill myself when it'll hurt my family. Really sucks because I can't bear this pain anymore and want nothing more than to just die."
3336,"December 25th, 2019",That's the day. I'm done.
3337,Do people who commit suicide by a zip tie around their neck (with or without a towel below it) experience a high after some 5 seconds?,
3338,This is it,"Well everything has finally gone wrong. My family all moved away and my roommate is going to kick me out because I can’t pay rent. I lost my job and my best friend. So unless I figure out how to pay rent in the next few days, this is it for me bois. It’s been a shitty and lonely run. I hope you guys can find hope in your lives."
3339,"Is it common during exam week in college that in the back of your mind, you’re constantly thinking to kill yourself?","I’m surprised not many students commit suicide during these exam weeks because I always have the thought of killing myself in the back of my mind during it. I’m definitely not in a worse place than many other people, so I’m surprised not too many people actually do it. I feel like if someone gave me a gun, it wouldn’t be too hard to convince yourself."
3340,Thank you strangers,I just wanted to thank all you strangers in the internet. I have been lurking on this sub for months and always see all the kindness in the comments to help prevent someone from hurting themselves. I posted a couple of days ago when I finally hit rock bottom and I will say that 90% of me was over this life and didn’t want any help or kind words but 10% still had hope. I received no comments or messages and I realize now that the 10% that was holding on was a waste of time. I realize that even if internet strangers can’t be bothered with a kind word my existence really does mean nothing. Thank you all so much for helping me actually give up. I hope my death helps others get the help they need.
3341,This has to be hell,"When I want to kill myself and am confronted with the idea of there potentially being something worse on the other side I honestly can’t think of what that would be. Every aspect of this life can be twisted around in my head to make me feel like shit, and it honestly feels designed. All comfort is boiled down to a cope, all fantasies are turned into mockery, and every glimmer of hope turns into crushing pain as I see it go away. Literally anything else after feels better after this life, and if hell’s on the other side it’s probably just more of the same shit"
3342,What’s the point of life if you can’t build relationships with others?,"Never had a girlfriend
No one has ever had feelings for me 
My life is just wake up, go to school, study, gym, sleep
I’m fucking fed up and I think I’m gonna quit soon because if I’m not experiencing life to it’s fullest then fuck everything I’m outta here 
Juice Wrld I’m coming to ya bro"
3343,venting,"

I’m literally on the brink of just taking every pill I can find. The only thing stopping me is the financial problems. But whats the use? 

The north korea stuff triggered the fuck out of me snd all i can think of now is “im going to die.” I wanted only ME to die not my friends and brothers. I’ve already been suicidal for a while now but this has pushed me so much.

I cant concentrate on two weeks worth amount of work due that i have to turn in tomorrow, i cant do anything but wallow. I told my mom i wanted to kill myself hoping she would take me to a crisis center so i could calm down and be stopped cause im really fucking scared but she didnt care and i dont know what to do anymore.

Theres not a day i dont rock myself because of how stressed and anxious i am. Theres not a day i dont contemplate killing myself. I relapsed with self harm recently too. Im just a big fuck up and i dont want to be here anymore.

I have to turn in all of this work tomorrow AND a novel but ive been in such a depressive state that i havent been able to finish (charter school btw). I tried emailing my teacher but she called bullshit on me and told me i can do it all anyway and im stressed to the point where if i even look at it i break down. I have the worst migraine right now and i cant even fucking comprehend the fucking letters! Im going to show up there and embarrass myself looking like a fucking bum im so disgusting

I keep getting phrases stuck in my head and its frustrating the fuck out of me and i just want to pull out all of my fucking hair"
3344,I feel shit (rant-ish),Title. I'm so goshdamn stupid and ignorant. Accidentally registered for a summer course that I can't get out of. Have to pay an extra 2k due to silly year 1 mistakes. Not only do I mess up other people lives I mess up my own income and savings. It's all just one big mess and mistakes after another. Goddamnit.
3345,Crying?,I learned at an early age that crying does nothing. I was raised in a household where emotional support or connection was not really talked about. Crying is useless. I am in so much mental anguish that I feel burnt out. More or less feels like I want to breakdown but not cry. I just want to be destructive so at least there is one thing I can have control. It’s late but all I can think about is my never-ending thoughts of being so worthless with real
3346,Actively suicidal for like the 5th time in 2 weeks,"I'm drunk, I've gone to the doctor, I've seen therapists at my university, I've called family and they tell me to go to sleep, I've called crisis lines, I want to die and I don't know what to do. I can't kill myself because I have a pet who needs me. I've attempted tons of times but I can't attempt again unless I KNOW FOR ABSOLUTE CERTAIN that I'll die. They keep telling me I don't ""really want to die"" but it's just because I know I have to do it abolutely right or not at all. I don't want to be hospitalised but I don't know what else to do. I'm fucking struggling."
3347,Waking up with anxiety,I woke up to noise and I am too full of anxiety to fall asleep. I’m having suicidal thoughts too. It’s a mess and I want to just die. Times like this made me wish there was someone here to reassure me everything was okay. AHHH maybe it’s better to just die than have moments like this. I’m shaking right now like what did I do to deserve this.
3348,Been staring at bottles of pills for hours,I want to feel the numbness of slipping away and not coming back so badly but I can’t do it right now
3349,I tried and failed to hang myself. I’m jumping off a bridge in 3 and 1/2 hours.,"I noticed the light chain could probably get tied together but I couldn’t knot it with a big enough loop. I tried for an hour.

Luckily in three and a half hours I have the opportunity to jump off a bridge. 

So yeah idk why I’m posting this here since I’ll be dead within the morning"
3350,Just got back from the bar.,"I just went to a bar for the first time in years. I was there with my husband and two of his coworkers. Everyone was talking to each other and having a good time except for me. I thought I would be able to break out of my shell a little and have fun but I just sat there and only talked if someone spoke to me, which only happened a few times. They were good people and they seemed fun but I just don't know how to talk to people.

My husband got very drunk and was flirting with the bartender and talking about his attractive coworkers, but I know he would never cheat on me. He was being very outgoing and having fun, and I'd only seen him like that a few times. I just feel like I'm holding him back from being himself and making him miserable. I'm always down and never do anything fun and I can tell it's really affecting him.

I know I'll never be able to make friends or have a job and I can't even bring anything into a relationship. I really think the world would be better off without me, I don't contribute to society at all, I just make people uncomfortable I think.

All night they were telling me that it's ok to be shy and they used to be shy but I don't think they understand the extent of it. I really don't think it will ever change for me. I try to get jobs but usually quit within a week because I'm just so awkward and I can tell people don't like me.

Idk what to do, I can't afford a therapist or antidepressants and I don't think it would help anyways because I've tried it before. I just want it all to be over with, I'm tired of trying to be happy and normal."
3351,When you see your best friend replace you...,"When you see and feel your best friend slowly fading away… slowly replacing you with a new, ""better"" best friend… it breaks in ways words fail to describe. Especially when they mean everything to you, especially when you've treated them with ever bit of love and care in your heart, especially when you've given them anything, you gave them your heart and trusted they wouldn't break it… but then one day they do, you feel a pain beyond any physical and emotional pain you have ever felt, your heart doesn't simply break no, instead it is ripped out of your chest and torn into pieces right in front of your eyes, and you are left bleeding to your very death while they're off happy with someone else. It hurts. It fucking hurts beyond repair. What am i supposed to do now, with a bleeding hole in my chest and eyes that won't stop crying tears of memories… what am I supposed to do without my best friend. I wasn't enough, he didn't just leave he completely and carelessly replaced me, like I never meant anything to him, like I was nothing, and at this point I too think I am nothing, just a lonely invisible broken man with no hope left. I really loved him more than anyone in this world, I cared so deeply about him and I never upset him, and I always tried with every ounce of my body to make him feel happy, loved, cared for…. But apparently I wasn't enough. I was, and still am, ready to jump in front of a speeding train for him. Without a second thought. I give up. I genuinely genuinely give up. I'm done living. I lost everything. I have no one else. I give up. I'm in so much pain. I can't stop crying. It hurts."
3352,I think this is it for me,Nothing gets better. I feel so numb to everything. I think it’s over. Probably won’t see much of the new year
3353,None of you care.,"I will die and all of you will laugh. It makes me sad thinking about it but it’s true.

You all hated me for years. Ever since I was born you all came up with ways to torture me.

Well you did it. You pushed me. I leave behind my 7 siblings, my girlfriend, my friends( they probably don’t care either), and my family.

My only regret is that I won’t see my mother who passed away 10 years ago. I’ll be in hell while she is disappointed in me, watching me from heaven.

To be fair, I’d rather have her be dissapointed in me when I’m in hell rather than this shitty life I live..
I’m getting this over with"
3354,I've been thinking about it all day today,"I ran a 5k with my neighbor and her kid to support their school. I went to spin class then yoga class. I came home and watched Netflix.

Every 10 min my brain tells me I shouldn't exist and no one cares about me. I'm medicated already and I don't know what else to do.

No one will text me if I don't text them. My only friend is being a jerk. My sister is a jerk. And my parents are fine but I can't tell them any of this because it will cause a panic.

I just wanted to post this here to get it out of my sister because I hate that I can't be happy and am wasting my life. I wish I could gift the hours of life have to someone else who would make better use of it."
3355,Can anyone relate to this?,"I have a whole other post talking about how I'm planning on killing myself on New Year's. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest.

Even if I don't kill myself, when I think about my future, everything just seems like a blur. I see no purpose in life after that. I feel like I will just be, bored. I've been hurt so much that, ive either forgotten or just have stopped caring about my goals. I barely leave the house (hell, I barely leave my room), but even when I *am* out doing something, I still have this feeling, like an emptiness in my chest that's craving for something to entertain myself with, craving to find a reason to live that I'll actually care about. But nothing ever sates that craving. It's always there.

Even if I don't kill myself soon, I honestly do not see myself living past 20 or 21. And even if I do, I know I'm just going to constantly feel like I need something more."
3356,"Thanks dad, you might drive me to the edge. And ya. Won't. Even. Care.","You decided to get off your bipolar meds and now you're a disgusting human being. You insult the homeless, say I'm going to get killed by the homeless who will then hang my dog off a bridge while they rape me and leave me for dead. Your mental state is deteriorated to the point I can no longer tolerate it. You degrade me to the point of tears. Thoughts flood in. Bad thoughts that I nevertheless would have had before. You just might see this to the end. I tried to help but I'm really think about calling quits on this one. Only little Nala is holding me off. She would be sad if I were to go."
3357,i hate existing right now.,"it's so fucking lonely. no friends to go to. no family that understands. the friends and family that do try to help always have something to say just to brush your problems away without acknowledging them. idk if that makes me spoiled though... they are saying something at least but they aren't making any effort other than just saying some optimistic life lesson like ""it will get better over time"". well what about now? i feel like shit right now and you're telling me to just wait it out? WHAT A SICK JOKE I MUST BE TO BE BRUSHED OFF LIKE THAT! i even tell my older sister straight up that i want to kill myself and she says that it will get better when i'm older like the rest of them. even if i'm somehow alive in a few more years that's not gonna guarantee that i'm gonna be better or not depressed anymore. it won't guarantee that i won't be alone anymore. this probably sounds spoiled af to some adults or other teens especially coming from a 16 year old but not having anyone understand you or try more than some optimistic quote to keep you alive a little longer in hopes you don't die soon is just as lonely as not having friends or family. i just want a connection for once in my life. someone that actually puts in time for me like i want to give time to them. it doesn't even have to be love or some shit like that. i just want someone that shows affection. like a best friend but like an actual best friend. all the best friends i've had were just the person that could find me barely bearable out of my friend groups. i want an intimacy with someone (not sexual. like care for me alot i mean). i want someone to want me because they want my intamacy and want to be real with me because of that. just one. it's all i want. being alone feels so depressing.

thanks for letting me vent i guess."
3358,I screwed up so hard,"I'm in very difficult science program at my university, and I love it, but I haven't done anything properly this term. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD. The thing is, I would be fully capable of getting through things if I just had better habits as I've always lacked work ethic, but I'm finding so hard to develop any self-discipline. The thing is, I've been given so much leeway, and it's so ridiculous that I've still managed to sabotage everything despite that. We had four reports that involve a lot of research and tend to be 4000+ words in length upon completion, and while I'm 95% two of them, I haven't handed anything in even though. I talked to my professor at the beginning of the term and she said that I don't have to follow any specific deadlines, and instead of just being grateful and working to fix the problem, I just let everything continue to add up, and there's no way that her and the TAs are just thinking ""what the actual \*\*\*\*"". 

I know that this is the program I want to stay in, and I want to change for good and go to grad school, but this is such a crucial course for that. If I fail this course, I'm finished. There's no chance I'll ever go to grad school, and I won't be able to handle that I screwed up everything by being lazy and not mustering up the willpower to get things done. Like now that I'm in deep water and have practically no way of getting out of this, I'm working my ass off. Even though I'm  low af and constantly  thinking of offing myself, I'm trudging through the work, so it's not like I wasn't capable of working earlier.  

My professor told me a week and a half ago that she couldn't afford to wait much longer, and she's been absolutely amazing by giving me this much freedom, so I can't complain. She recommended that I hand in 3/4 of them by LAST Monday since I'd at least pass the course, and said that she really wants to have marks back by the time exams start. Well exams started 3 days ago and though I've finally gotten myself to work, it's probably WAY too late. I haven't even communicated with her for a week and half, and even though I can probably have 2/3 of those done by tomorrow and the third sometime Wednesday night, I don't know if she'll even accept them or if she'll message me tomorrow or the day after to tell me that there's nothing else she can do. 

I screwed up so hard, and I hate myself so much. It's nobody's fault but my own, and I can't ask her for any more help at this point because she literally did everything she could to help me out. Also, even if I can work to get them in for Wednesday, I jumped between them and it's going to be awful for me to hand them in out of nowhere past the time she wanted to submit everyone's marks. It's not fair to her or the TA's that have to mark them. It's so inconsiderate of me, and there's no way they wouldn't be angry.

 I don't think there's any way I'm getting out of this. I screwed up my future, and there's no way I'm staying here after failing the course. It's not a course I can retake and a grad school accepting me after I've failed it doesn't seem realistic to me. Deep down, this is what I want my future to be in, but I ruined my chance for that. I'm not sticking around after that's sabotaged, and I've cornered myself and don't see a way I can fix the situation. I feel that there's no point and that I should just call it quits a bit early. I'm such a mess and I hate myself so much."
3359,I have hit a limit,"I'm done. I'm pathetic. I'm truly a worthless person. I quit my job because of one bad afternoon. I tried to use my last paycheck to buy gifts for my best friend and the website wouldn't accept my card. I have zero motivation to do anything. It's been like that since I was 7. But it was 8 when I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder among other things. I haven't been given help for the issues my family knew I had. I can't take it. I have money left for rope and an overpass isn't too far away from where I live. I love you guys, wish I loved me. Take care"
3360,I Ruined my Life (I'm not going to quit),"It's 4:20 AM and I can't fall asleep again. I feel completely destroyed, like I'm falling on this black pit and there's nowhere to hang out from.

I know all of you in this subreddit probably know the feeling.

It's been over two years since my last job as an accountant. I left it because I felt it was holding me back from getting my CPA degree. I didn't really left it. I just allowed myself to drift towards being fired and payed a good severance package.

I left my girlfriend at the same time too for more or less the same reason.

I don't honestly know what I've been doing for the past two years. Mostly drinking and trying/failing to study I guess.

I feel utterly alone, guilty and ashamed. I know my whole career is over (not that I ever cared much about it anyway) I feel I wasted all this time and that I have nothing to show for it.

Today I received a present from a friend because my birthday is getting near. I can't believe people still call me out of the blue to hang out with me and everything. It seems is fun to be around me I guess.

I won't do anything stupid. I know a lot of people care about me.

Tomorrow I'm taking one of the 7 tests I still need for my degree and I know I'll most likely fail. 

I'm going to fix my life. I'll start with something small. Doing exercise again (I used to love that). Maybe just taking things day by day I can get through this.

Thank you for bearing with me and sorry for the long and erratic post. I just needed to get this of my chest.

I Wish you good luck and strength to you all!"
3361,I’m 26 and I have no hope or will to live left.,"I haven’t done anything with my life for the past 3 years. My mom says she’s tired of supporting me and I just don’t have any motivation to do anything about it. The only reason I’m living is to not make my parents sad but since now they’re tired of me I guess I can go. 

I’m giving myself a month to get all my things in order. Deciding who to give which belongings to and how to ship and send. I really want to sell my laptop so I can visit my boyfriend and see him one last time but I’m so afraid it’ll just make things harder."
3362,I must help my friend,"He has some kind of mental illness. He sometimes looses control and he's trying to hurt himself. Then when he ""wokes up"" he doesn't remember anything. Beacuse of that he was bullied at his old school. They said ""Kill yourself it would be better for you"" or ""Only your mom would miss you"". He never had a friend before. Now in new school, he found friends, but he says he just cannot feel happy. He can't forget what happened, and thinks about it everyday. He claims he don't want to die, beacuse he don't want to hurt other, but he thinks about suicide. He says he doesn't deserve help, he agrees with the kids from old school, and he's looking for a new ways of hurting himself. I must put an end to this, but I don't know what can I do.
Thank you for reading, and please give me an advice."
3363,Goodbye letter to my friends,"disclaimer: please do not try to stop me. you will not change my mind. 

i couldn't bring myself to tell them this myself, so i'm going to post here, i guess. i don't know. for closure, maybe, before it's all over.

i'm really sorry that i broke your trust. i'm pathetic, i know. and i wasn't thinking straight. i never do. especially when i'm on 2 hours of sleep from 48 hours, i didn't think rationally and i made that choice to be a dumbass once again.

i wish you guys never met me, so you didn't have to deal with my bullshit. so you didn't have to see that side of me that you didn't know. that i once liked that psychopathic asshole who only made me feel like shit. and that i made that mistake, and i lost you guys in the process.

it fucking hurts so much. ultimately, in the end. this is all over. because of me. because of my stupid fucking ass. i really want to fucking go back in time and choke myself to death so i wouldnt fucking do that. why am i such a fucking dumbass, god. 

anyway. i hope you guys just forget about me, move on with your lives, and be happy. 

it was really nice knowing you all. i enjoyed the conversations we had, and the fun times we shared. i'll really fucking miss you guys. you were the fucking best. i really fucking loved you guys i can't even say how much i loved you all. i can't believe i did that, and i'm sorry.

i'll still be here until saturday, because that's the only time that i can do it. but yeah. this is it. this is goodbye. and i'm sorry. i'm sorry that i'm so pathetic.

and once i'm gone, please don't blame yourselves, and just forget about me. i've always hated myself, and felt suicidal every day, so this was just inevitable. i mean, everything in my life right now is going in a downward spiral, so yeah, haha. 

in the end, everybody always ends up hating me. everyone ends up despising me. me being such a fucking loser. i hate myself. i'm so fucking ugly, and so fucking fat. i'm just a disgusting person, i sometimes starve myself for days and then binge eat. i can't hold conversations or talk to people like a normal person because of my social anxiety. i get panic attacks often and break down because i'm weak. 

i always fuck up everything and end up disappointing everyone. my parents always fucking yell at me to do better, to stop being such a dumb bitch and get my shit together, but i can't. i just can't. i'm so pathetic that i'm failing math, the one subject that i used to be good at. i can't even think properly anymore and i'm not at all what i used to be. 

i'm just a fucking mess. i'm so pathetic in ways that you can't imagine.

i can't even do simple maths correctly because my mind is always so jumbled, and i always make stupid, ridiculous mistakes.

i can't pay attention in class ever because i stress out over how fucking stupid and worthless i am every single day.

i still get extreme test anxiety sometimes, even after 4 years, because i'm constantly reminded of how much of a failure i am.

i cut myself and drink often because i'm so fucking incompetent and disgusting and deserve to burn in hell. i'm also a stupid fucking coward that wants an easy way to relieve the pain.

i have acknowledged that i'm always a disappointment who fails at everything in life, who fucks up every fucking thing, who deserves to die, like people have said. 

and, every passing day, i just feel so lost. i don't remember what i used to think or how i used to feel or how i used to act. 

i just don't understand how the fuck to behave or how to talk to people like normal. how to actual function like a normal being? i have no fucking clue. 

i don't know what i'm supposed to be like or who the fuck i am. i can't tell what is fake and what is real.

i just feel like i'm constantly in a state of delusion and i want to just get rid of myself.

i'm sorry. i wish i was a different person. i wish i wasn't like this. i'm sorry that i disappointed you guys. i'm sorry for everything. i'm sorry for getting involved in your lives. i should have just remained isolated from people again, just like i did for 4 years. i should have just stuck with that and not try to get close to people again. i should have just done that, because i always fuck things up. 

i love you guys. i hope you have a great life. i wish you well. thank you for everything. 

thank you. you guys made this idiot feel really happy. haha. yeah. 

love you all,
goodbye."
3364,Suicide hotlines suck ass,Just on one. Made me feel worse. There was so much awkward silence and lot of okays and uh-huhs. God still wanna kill my self
3365,This community makes me think i might belong in this world afterall.,"After my last post...alot of ppl reached out. I still want to kill myself but now know i am not the only one. All my lyf i felt out of place...i have a family but i rather be an orphan than live with those ppl. So to all the internet strangers that care...we live in a big bad world with very little sympathy for our fellow human beings. Reaching out...showing lil kindness will not take away someone's pain but at least it makes them believe that they have a voice that can be heard. 
I read this poem few years back..hope it summons what i mean:
"" To all those who sleep tonight,far from the one's u  love
No hand to your left or right..
Just emptiness above.
Don't u think that u r alone..
The whole world shares your tears
Some for maybe a day or to..
And some for all their years."""
3366,First Post Ever: Introduction to My Battle with Suicide/Depression,"Made my very first Reddit account b/c I found this subreddit by Googling ""reasons for suicide"" to see if I could find anyone in the same awful boat I am in. I'm sure you can tell by my username, but I still have an amount of hope in me -- despite my intense battles with suicidal thoughts. I am 23/F, and I want to be an author someday.

My head has been a mess -- a worsening mess -- for almost five years. It's hard to breakdown all the reason for it, but I can say for certain that I have no will to live. I'm not gonna give you the rundown of my life, just the skinny on when my problems started...just...tryna' get some support, I suppose.

I was diagnosed with depression and Asperger's Syndrome three years ago. This at least put a name to all the issues I'd dealt with all my life. Skip to tonight, as I write this:. The current things that contribute to my bouts of suicidal thoughts include:

I'm in my 5th year of uni studying English, b/c I'm taking too long to graduate, my loan money is cut off by 1/2 (I will need to take out a loan from the bank to even keep going to school). I had a good scholarship, but lost it two years ago when my depression caused me to stop giving a shit about my grades. I have 0 motivation to get my degree. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I work for minimum wage just so nearly all of it can get funneled into school expenses. I'm an introvert with exactly one (count it, 1) friend -- albeit the best friend I've ever had -- that I speak to anymore.

I dated one guy I barely liked in HS and have dated no one since. My personal love life statistics are: dated 1, kissed 2, laid 0. That shit hurts. I don't like drinking in bars or dancing, so I have not met anyone. Every guy I actually like is always taken, and the type of guy I crave doesn't exist, apparently. I feel unlovable, and I sit by and watch as people I knew in HS get married and have babies. 

I've failed at school, at life, and everything else. I have no lover, no career, no children, nothing that's keeping me here. School and everything else has almost killed my passion for writing. I have my senior exit project due tomorrow and I haven't finished it (after I post this, I'm gonna go back to getting tipsey and hammering out the rest of the project that will make me ashamed to have my name on). I procrastinated on it for MONTHS b/c I was SO ANXIOUS about it, so...there's another failure to add the list.

So anyway. Hi, r/SuicideWatch. Meet your newest disaster on the pile."
3367,Why do I even try?,"I'm fine with small talk or shooting the shit- but I'm dying inside. I dont know if i should even keep trying. It's exhausting. I can keep putting on a smile for work or for daily interaction, but I'm always thinking about why I'm even here. I should've been gone by now- you know the feeling?

I've had 5 suicide attempts and multiple overdoses. When I'm on the upside of the rollercoaster I tell myself that I'm still here for a reason. . . But really, I'm not sure at all. Daily life seems so meaningless sometimes. 

I'm ready to move onto my next life already! Take me now."
3368,killing myself in hospital,"Think I’m getting admitted to psych ward soon, gonna kms there so my family don’t have to find me dead, been to the place twice before, don’t think it would be hard to smuggle a blade in"
3369,killingmyself,i want to kill myself so badly i feel so dissociated that it doesnt feel like my body is mine its like im looking at life through a tv everytime i go to sleep i see  my family and best friend being totured and slaughtered when im awake i hear voices and people screaming i keep seeing dead people watching me from behind things i keep feeling people touching me but there is noone there i cant sleep anymore out of paranoia i think im ready to leave this world i feel so alone i cant believe i didnt kill myself when i turned 18 like i said i would im so fucking stupid i was such a pathetic excuse for someone given the gift of life and my mom is gonna cry which is making me cry i cant stay living everyday is mentally exausting living through this and all im gonna succeed in doing is leaving a post on fucking reddit about killing myself before i paint the ceiling with blood enjoy my final words to my meaningless existence :) appreciate what you have and what you dont
3370,I don't want to be a burden,"I'm really close to ending it tonight, I know i should go to the ER and get help but then it becomes public and my family gets involved and I don't want to be a burden. I want to go and get help but I don't want to upset my family even more than they already are..."
3371,Past ruined my life.,"When I was younger I did stuff with my cousin. And im paying price 

Im not diagnosed. But. I honestly in my opinion for sure have ptsd. I was diagnosed with depression. But. I dun care about that. 

Its the ""ptsd"". 

Ruined everything. 

I couldnt graduate high school like I wanted. I did online school but. My only goal was to graduate my original school. And i failed it. 

Grades went so low. Absent so much. Online school was only option

I think i lost my friend cuz of it. Cuz i was too scared of her brother. 

I am too scared to go outside. Yes i go outside. But im always scared. Always. 

I lost my bf today. Cuz i am so crazy. I lost him. 

It hurts yes. A lot. No job. No school. No relationships. All cuz of me. Me. 

It hurts yes. 

Hurts even more that. All this. Is just cuz of 1 person who forgot about me by now. 

And. Now my bf will forget me too. 

I wanna cut but what for. It does nothing. 

I wanna die. 

At least people will think. Oh darn she WAS gonna do this and this. Dam. She was close. 

Not. 

She never did this and this. She also was this and this. She grew old and did nothing. Than died. 


Ik ppl will be mad at me. Cuz everyone. I mean everyone. Sees i have no reason. I have no excuse


But it hurts


Last night my head was filled. And rn im just heartbroken. 

I am gonna start planning how to die. 

Posting on here to just express. I have nobody to tell. Im all alone in this. Its scary to die. But i dun wanna be heartbroken anymore.  Im scared of the world and people. 

I just hope i die within a year. Sooner. I just. Needa start figuring things out. I dunno whata do yet. 

It just sucks being born for no reason at all. I never had the chance of being a normal person. Was taken fast. 

Goner really. 

Bye"

3373,My friend was talking to me about killing herself and I don’t know what to do. I’m really scared that she’ll do it,"My friend has struggled with depression her whole life. She’s getting divorced, she had a boyfriend for a year which from an outside perspective was the worst type of relationship to witness, and she has had an abusive relationship with her parents. I moved away to another state about a month ago, and we keep up with each other online. Just a couple hours ago, she was telling me how she was researching ways to kill herself peacefully. She approached it in a very casual way which scares the hell out of me. It was like it was any other conversation, like she was deciding what groceries to buy. I’ve know about her suicidal thoughts before, but she’s never talked about it like this. All I could do really was plead her not to talk about it like that and to not do it. I couldn’t think of anything else to say. I just need some advice because I’m really scared she’ll do it."
3374,Not in a good place,"I just got caught plagiarizing in my paper and I don’t know what is going to happen. I have no clue what I want to major in or do with my life. Now I have none of this. I might get expelled, I’m not sure what is going to happen. I thought college would be a new beginning for me where I would meet good people and succeed. Now I may not have any of this. I honestly just feel as though ending it would be better than continuing my life of pain and anxiety"
3375,suicide,i want to kill myself so badly i feel so dissociated that it doesnt feel like my body is mine its like im looking at life through a tv everytime i go to sleep i see  my family and best friend being totured and slaughtered when im awake i hear voices and people screaming i keep seeing dead people watching me from behind things i keep feeling people touching me but there is noone there i cant sleep anymore out of paranoia i think im ready to leave i feel so alone i cant believe i didnt kill myself when i turned 18 like i said i would im so fucking stupid i was such a pathetic excuse for someone given the gift of life and all im gonna succeed in doing is leaving a post on fucking reddit about killing myself before i paint the ceiling with blood enjoy my final words to my meaningless existence :)
3376,I have all the hope but no hope at the same time.,"I am future focused. I know if I hang on, I will live a life that has fulfillment. I just can't the stop the suicidal thoughts. It makes very hard to not live because they get the better of me. 

I have done everything I am told to and feel like doing. I try my hardest. I have engaged in therapy for over a decade plus. I use all the techniques and successful so. I take all my meds. I have stopped using drugs and alcohol and been clean for few years. I am loved and respected by a few(which is enough) which I only dreamed of a few years ago. I have reached all dreams and goals. Smashed them actually. 

I should want to live because I have worked so hard to enjoy what I have, but the suicidal thoughts don't stop. I don't even want them. An everybody does everything to help. I am very grateful for it. I feel like a failure because I can't stop them. An I also know I am not failure. I am in rock and very hard place. 

An the anonymity is why I am tell random on the internet. I hate attention. But I don't what to do anymore so I am crowd-sourcing. Hoping someone give me answer because I don't want to kill myself but I will."
3377,dissociated,hey my name is Ian does anyone else feel dissociated
3378,I find no reason to live anymore,"I would do it, but I’m so scared of failing. I can handle the pain, I think. But knowing there’s a chance where I would fail and everyone would know. 

I don’t think life is for me. I really wanna fucking end it. 

I really wanna die."
3379,I wish I could put a bullet through my brain.,"I'm so done fighting every damn day of my life for a little bit of happiness that'll just get whisked away when I wake up.

I'm so done trying so hard to smile when it kills me more and more to pretend I'm okay.

I'm so done living in this shitty financial situation turning down social outings because I'm trying to fucking eat or fill my tank up.

I'm so done living in this shitty, unsafe city so far away from my work and my friends and everything I know.

I'm so done looking in the mirror and seeing me, ugly with really bad facial tics that just keep getting worse and worse.

I'm so done being unable to wake up in the morning to the point where I've missed just about every class this semester, and I'm so done with people calling me lazy, or that I don't care, or that I'll never amount to anything because of it.

I'm so done laying in bed wanting to die because I'm so fucking lonely.

I'm so done being lonely.

I'm so done being alone.

I just want someone to hold me and tell me it's going to be okay.

I don't care who. I just want to love someone. I want someone to love me back.

STOP FUCKING SAYING THAT I'LL FIND SOMEONE ONE DAY. It doesn't help. Someday never seems to come. It never will come. Everyone around me is in relationships and I fucking hate looking at them and seeing them happy because I'm so lonely.

I have friends, but I don't have friends.

I have family, but I don't  have family.

I have people, yet they don't fucking care about me.

If I put a bullet through my brain I bet maybe 3-4 people would cry, and the rest would just post on their stories because it makes them look good.

And don't tell me that I gotta keep going for those 3-4 people. It doesn't help. It makes me feel selfish for thinking of suicide at all. It makes me feel selfish for not wanting to go through this shit every day. ""You gotta keep going, you just gotta"" Man fuck off with that shit. 

I'm still kicking because I know that one day I will be glad I didn't kill myself, and I know I gotta keep living to help all those who are going through the same shit as I am, addicted to drugs because they see it as the only way to heal a broken heart.

I'm still alive because I know I have a greater purpose than to just die and not have any impact on this world.

If I can make this world a bit better, then maybe it'd be worth it to stick around. That's what the big dream has been all along, right?

But I just don't know if I can... I just want things to be a little bit easier, is that too much to ask for?"
3380,Why should I bother living when I’m never happy?,My mom says I’m selfish for wanting happiness. Or at least to get rid of this mental illness. I had a mental breakdown in which I lost control of my body and my mom got really mad at me for it. My mental illness just ruined a four year long friendship because my mind decided to start seeing her as extremely annoying and condescending when they weren’t meaning it. I feel like a piece of shit every day. I feel like I’m already suffocating and when I don’t have access to my coping methods I feel like dying. I want to break my fucking skull on the concrete. If I’m not doing something with my life I become suicidal. I’m gonna slowly lose all my friends because of this. I want to die. “GUH HUH GO TO A PSYCHIATRIST” I have already been to fucking six of them. Nothing works. I have an incurable mental illness. And I’ve taken at least 6 different medications for it. I have no reason to live anymore and no resources. I want to cut my stomach open and rip my innards out. I want to fucking die. I deserve it.
3381,Wish I would die in my sleep,I hate everything and everyone.
3382,My life is a burden,"What if I just find that right vein? After all the mental anguish and physical torture, what if I manage to put a dent in? It would be like a contest reward.

Think about the peace it'd bring along. For once my brain would stay quiet. For once it wouldn’t remind me of all the things I did wrong and all the terrible decisions I made. It would all be white noise.

I wouldn't be the burden I am anymore.

I know a handful of people will get mildly sad when they get the phone call from someone four days after my death. A professor would maybe realise that I haven't been uploading any assignments lately. Someone would suggest knocking on my dorm room that has been closed for the past week. Though I tend to keep my door open for a casual conversation with my roommate, she wouldn't realise the closed door and the unusually quiet room, devoid of keyboard clacking. Why would she? Everyone has better things to do.

The sadness will leave its place to indifference in a matter of days. People are busy; they have many reasons to forget.

It would look messy, maybe would need some cleaning afterwards.

Swallowing the right number of pills might be a cleaner way to go.

No need to upset anyone. I'm already causing enough trouble."
3383,Why,"Life just seems so fucking meaningless. I’ve been on a cocktail of antidepressants referred by my doctor and it just seems like nothing has helped. I know the the drug itself isn’t supposed to cure depression (you need to include yourself in social engagements and activity as well obviously). But everything I have tried just doesn’t seem to improve anything, I feel so fucking alone and such a burden to everyone I come in contact with. I really just don’t see how this is all worth it. I’m sorry"
3384,What am I even supposed to do at this point,"I went to a counselor and told my mom about problems I've had with focusing in school, but the counselor said she really couldn't do anything about it and my mom doesn't even care about how I feel as long as I meet her expectations. I can't even tell my counselor about my more intrusive thoughts because then they'll call my parents and make everything worse, like, do my feelings just not matter unless I want to kill myself?"
3385,Not in a good place,"I recently got caught plagiarizing part of my paper at my university and I have now clue how this will end up. I have no clue what I want to do with my life and what major to pursue. Now I may not have any of that because I was stupid and stressed so I took ideas and sentences from another source online.  I thought college would be a good fresh start for me where I would have friends and do good in school but I’m just a failure. I honestly just want to die, it seems like life never gets better...."
3386,Might be too late idk. Someone please talk to me.,Someone talk to me.
3387,I just hope things get a bit clearer as time goes. It's getting tougher and tougher with each day.,"I'm thinking about my future a lot lately, and it seems bleak and hopeless. I know there's still hope and that I've just started, there's a long way to go. No one knows what the future has in for them. 
But the very idea of that long journey ahead of me, scares me. There are going to be happy moments, but there are going to be sad ones too. And I currently feel too exhausted to even think about ever dealing with them again. 
I can't deal with negativity right now, but it's is omnipresent as is positivity. I have no idea what I'm going to do in my life. 
I'm jobless. And I have lost a lot of my determination. It's seems so dark ahead."
3388,In my 28 years of life the only thing I learned was to embrace loneliness,"And I'm ok with it. I mean I don't have any friends, I don't have a gf and at first I felt bad about it but I realize that I don't need people in my life to live. 

What bothers me is the fact that I fail in everything I try since always. I can't accomplished nothing cause I'm a worthless piece of garbage. I tried suicide a few times in the last couple of years, I grabbed a gun that belongs to my father but I was to pussy to pulled the trigger. I don't want to cause him any trouble by using his gun neither. I really don't know how to go on... I just feel useless. Every thought I have leads me to killing myself sooner or later.

I just want to get a job but I can't, nobody hires me cause I don't know how to do nothing. And I do try, is not like I spend all my days just sitting or laying, no. I look for jobs anywhere but I just can't have one. And this is all that I want in my life, I am at a point were I don't give a damn to be alone for the rest of my life, but I want to work cause is the only motivation I have in my pathetic life. I know I'm not gonna have anymore friends or anything and is ok... but I can't live anymore like this feeling like trash. I wanna get a job, have my own house and just spend the rest of my life alone. But every day that simple dream is more far away and the thought of killing myself more closer...

And now comes the freaking christmas and, I love my family, but I have to pretend that I'm ok and watch how all my brothers and sisters have their own familys and friends and I'm gonna just be sitting there without doing nothing cause I have nothing to say or share to them. I feel embarassing of myself, for being the only one in a big family that is pure garbage good for nothing.

I wish these are my last holidays cause I can't live anymore like this."
3389,This place saved my life last night. Thank you all.,"I always delete my posts because reading them again triggers my dark place, but I just wanted to say thank you. I'll be hanging out for a while and trying my best to help some others. It's the least I can do.

Well wishes to you all."
3390,I hate being such an idiot and being so stupid,"It became obvious to me today that I’m an idiot who can’t get my words out and can’t express the way I feel correctly. Not only that but I say things too bluntly and sometimes don’t say enough. I noticed it when I was talking to this girl I like, which was a sort of big deal for me because it’s not every day which I talk to someone new and I screwed it all up by sounding like an asshole even though I was just trying to be funny. I’m tired of being me I hate hearing my own name and I hate existing. 

I’m not super hurt about the girl calling me an asshole but because thinking back I am an asshole and most of the time I don’t mean to be one. I tried fixing it by saying I didn’t mean it as an insult but maybe she doesn’t believe it or just doesn’t care and honestly if I would have thought twice about the shit I said I wouldn’t have been here."
3391,"Afraid of ""help""","I have a great therapist. It just isn't enough right now, but I feel like reaching out in any other way will only land me inpatient. I was sexually assaulted by a staff member the last time I was inpatient.

I rather kill myself than go to inpatient, but there are no other options I can see.

Desperate."
3392,2019 has been the worst year of my life.,"My doctor doesn’t know what’s wrong with me so she’s sending me to a cardiologist where the waiting list is about 18 months. I’m failing all of my classes. My mental health has gotten so much worse. The antidepressants I’m on ruined my appetite and I’ve lost more than 10lbs but I won’t do anything about it cause it’s triggering my eating disorder really badly. My mom got into a car crash because of me and we lost our truck and a couple thousand dollars. My dog is not herself anymore and I’m scared she’s going to die soon. My uncle has three brain tumours and is probably going to die within the next couple weeks. I have a mri in a couple weeks that is freaking me out. Exams are in January and I know I won’t pass any of them. I have gym next semester and because of my undiagnosed heart condition I can barely walk without my heart are getting to 150, let alone exercise. I skipped school and spent all my money on shit. My gender is fucking fucked. I’ve been having more and more flashbacks about my trauma lately even though it’s been 3 years. My parents are asking me for money but I literally have $5. I don’t have a job because I’m waiting until I’m over the legal age to not be under adult supervision all the time. God. I can’t even go to school at least 3 days a week. I’m worthless. All my dreams have shattered and I’m only holding on by stupid shit. “I can’t miss that charity livestream on the 14th.” Jesus fuck my life is worthless. The only thing that has brought me some sort of happiness was getting my piercings. That’s it. That’s the only thing that has made me happy in the last couple months."
3393,YOU’RE A PUPPET that’s why you want to kill yourself,"The truth is everything you know is a lie. That is why you’re so fucking depressed and that is why there is this empty void inside you that never fills up no matter how hard you try. Enough is never enough. Things don’t keep easy and the accomplishment doesn’t last long. When I say the world is a lie, I don’t just mean two faced people and a ridiculous society built on nothing but exploitation and slavery. I literally mean everything you see is deception. Actors don’t stop acting when they get of screen and people act when it isn’t even their own career. The news is fake. They always show you on movies when humanity is at the verge of extinction that the news alerts everybody so all of us fucking sheep automatically assume if anything were to happen that we would be warned LMAO. It’s called programming, and that is just the tip of the ice berg. I’m not crazy , YOU’RE crazy and afraid if you live in ignorance and choose not to entertain such scary assumptions because the hierarchy couldn’t do that right? Because we should trust these faceless people we don’t know? Because only lowborn black people or people with mental issues or strong religious beliefs are the real threat? What if they’re just a fucking result of this joke that we live. Did you ever think of that? YOU are absolutely crazy if you think government has your back. If the world ever falls , don’t expect them to come clean everything up because the truth is the system is so fragile. You’re made to believe it’s this strong hold which can always bounce back.. but youre wrong. It’s an illusion. Everything isn’t real. We truly live in an invisible prison. We are depressed because this isn’t right. We are depressed because we don’t know who we fucking are. Where do we come from really? We aren’t just this spec floating in space , we are fucking more but people are too busy instagramming , following trends and being so god damn fake to see and that is why a lot of us end up so fucking TIRED. Ignorance is bliss, it’s always has been. I wish I was ignorant, I wish everything I’m saying was crazy but it’s not.. We are numbers , we are money makers and we are absolutely not important in the grand scheme of things.. even though some people can’t put this into words or just simply cannot put their finger on what it is exactly that they’re feeling.. whatever the case may be, death feels like the answer .. so don’t tell me the world is fine when people are literally dying to check out early"
3394,Sotting on my bedroom floor,"Dysphoria hit me like a brick wall and i just want to scream and cry but i cant. I just feel numb and detached from everything but how wrong my body is. I couldve been a cute lanky boy if i was born cis but im fucking not. Im short and pudgy and curvy in all the worst places. Ive been on testosterone for three years next month and have a pretty decent beard yet still get misgendered day after day.
Why couldnt i have been just born cis or at least cute

Even having my meds be upped and changed AGAIN, they arent working. I dont think my therapist realizes how fucked up i am either even when i try explaining.

My one friend isnt even able to talk to me because theyre busy and their phone is at 1% 

My whole body is just screaming for me to end it. I know i wont do anything because im a fucking coward but that doesnt stop the internal yelling. Every fiber of my being just wants to die and it hurts so much"
3395,Reaching out,"Can I just openly ask everyone what’s brought them to this point? 

I’m reading through some of your words and it really resonates with me. My heart really goes out to everyone as I really understand that ache in your heart. 

I’ve tried to write other posts or talk to others but I always stop myself or just delete before sending just seems easier."
3396,I can’t stop crying,WHY CANT SOMEONE JUST HELP ME?
3397,I thought childhood trauma would be a thing of the past once I moved out but it still distresses me,
3398,Fuck the National Suicide Prevention Hotline,"My depression has been eating me alive today and I needed to talk with someone. So I called the crisis line. Was on hold for 20 minutes before I got connected with a young man who sat in silence. I hung up after about 5 minutes. Called back 5 hours later, was on hold for 30 minutes, got connected with a young woman who said she didn't know what I expected her to do and pointed out that I'd already called once today. Fuck all of them. Fuck this country that thinks that one 10-minute phone call a week is enough to help someone who's considering suicide. Fuck the volunteers who can't be bothered to listen and are just reading off a script. I'm sorry that taking a bubble bath or watching a funny movie doesn't solve my problems. Next time someone kills himself and people wonder why he did it ... maybe this is why. No one knows how to listen any more."
3400,First Time Crying in Years,"Hey all. As the title says today was the first time I cried in years. Now yeah, I've cried at stupid jokes and pain if I hurt myself real bad. But this is my first legitimate emotional cry. I've suffered from depression with anhedonia being the main side effect for years now. What made me cry was just stupid. My family and I traveled for two days to get to an audition I had, I haven't been feeling too well but we already spent the money so I decided to push through. Today it's time for the audition and I drop the ball fucking hard. I've put on this confident persona to help with my nerves but as soon as the audition was over it fell to bits, I was back to hating myself and wishing I were dead. Got another two days till I get home, Hope's are it's cold enough where I'm from to off myself from hypothermia. I tried. Not sure if I tried hard enough but I tried. I'll keep trying, but I'm not sure how much more I got in me."
3401,so few people care about other people and it makes me so upset,I feel so depressed thinking about how many people are in a simillar situation as my friend but have no one to talk to. Im so horribly sad when I think about people that have killed themselves... its like seeing my best friend die. because I know they ARE my best friend. they are humans going through tough times just like my best friend. I help my best friend the most that I can and I wish other people would do the same for everyone else on this sub. Im just sad because I know everyone thats died from suicide could have been a friend. I wish people had friends. it really really breaks my heart and its retarded that I cry over strangers but thats how it is. so many people have taken their ownlives because of trauma and numbness and the reason i posted this here is because I want people (who can help) to help people in New. So many people die in the new feed. Im hysterical I know but maybe somoene can decipher my cry-typing
3402,I’m in so much pain. I want to end it.,"My bf of 3year just broke up with me yesterday. I love this guy so much. In this entire world, he was the only person that brought hope into my life. It’s my fault he wanted to break up. I feel so useless and I hate myself for it. I want to end my life but I’m so scared. I’m hurting so bad. He was the only person that understood me. The only person that connected with me. The only person that comforted me when I was experiencing pain. I’m panicking and he’s not here. I’m really afraid. I fee so alone. I feel like I’m going insane. I really wanna kill myself.  I need him. I can’t even begin to express how hurt I am. My chest hurts from panicking, my eyes and head hurt from crying. I don’t know what to do. Please help me. I’m really scared. I don’t know what to do. Please."
3403,Not the help I asked for,"Reached out to an old friend and asked for help. Said that I was not in the mood for any sex but if he could just come over and hold me. Guess that wasn't enough. This was not the kind of help I asked for. Or needed. Now I feel even worse. I've learned my lesson. Back to the original plan, how to kill myself."
3404,Never told anyone this,"I have brain damage on the left side of my brain. It's irreversible but i never believed that it was. I started researching and putting into practice anything that has the potential to help and eliminating any habit that could damage the brain in general (like drinking, and sugar, etc). I tried to beat it, it's my third year trying to prove the doctors wrong. When you feel like you ve tried everything and it never seems to truly improve, you get desperate. This year I started having suicidal thoughts. Life is just unbearable with my ""condition"". Everything is hard. I got accepted in my dream school before the damage occured, now i feel like a fraud. I can barely read. Most days i got to school, come back and can t even remember what classes i just went to. Every week for the past 2 years I've been scared that someone is going to see that I'm not supposed to be there and that Ill get expelled.  I took a year off of school in the hopes of finding a way to cope, but months have passed and im truly scared that i wont before next year. I never told anyone this, just kind of hinted stuff here and there and just needed to get it out somewhere."
3405,Just a question.,Can tylenol kill me and how much would I meed to take to actually die?
3406,I need help,So I tried last month going to try again tonight. But my question is if there’s anyway to make the belt around the neck thing a little less agonizing.
3407,If anyone wants too talk...,"If anyone wants to talk just dm me. I will never ignore a DM, intentionally of course. I am going to bed soon but any DMs before that will be answered. I have work in the morning too, so I won't be replying to DMs, other than a small window in 7 hours for 14 hours"
3408,I need to share,"Hey everyone. Thought I'd just kinda share what's been going on the past 6 months since I've been on the brink of ending it all for about that long. On mobile, sorry for formatting issues. 

So I was engaged for a while, to a girl I now realize is fucked up and batshit crazy (faking mental illnesses and stuff). We were trying to get pregnant and did. Fast forward to June, and I come home from a buddy's place, and immediately see police pulling into my neighborhood from the window. 

I walk outside to see if it's for my street. They stop directly in front of my house. Two officers get out of said vehicles and approach me. The following interaction occurs. 

PO: ""Hey, are you Adam?""
Me:""Yeah, what's up?""
PO:""What's going on with you and your fiance?""
M:""Uhh nothing, I haven't even seen her today, why?""
PO:""Well we got a call saying you slammed her face into the washing machine, kicked in the bathroom door, and took her phone so she couldn't call us.""

A bit more banter, and I'm in cuffs, on the way to the station for a crime I didn't commit. Spent the night in jail. Got charged with 3rd degree assault, two counts of criminal mischief, and endangering the welfare of a child. 

I get released the next morning due to not having a record ever, and immediately text the girl I was with before this one, asking if I can come over. She says sure, I go there, end up staying there for a few days. Come back home for an appointment, immediately go back to this girl's house. A couple days go by and we've been talking heavily about our past relationship and agree we really needed each other and still do, so we get back together. Christmas will be 6 months. 

We ended up moving in with her mom. All is fine for about 3½ months. Then my now ex, the pregnant one, has the kid. I'm not allowed to be there and still haven't seen my child due to a restraining order. A week goes by, and she then creates a fake Facebook with my name and profile picture. Uses that to threaten herself and the baby to one of her friends. She makes a police report about that, and now I have a felony criminal contempt charge. 

Fast forward another month. I'm laying on the futon in the basement, my girl next to me working on her business. My phone vibrates. Okay, no big deal, probably just Twitter or something, right?

It proceeds to vibrate about five more times in less than a minute. So I pick it up. Messages on Instagram. From one of my ex's friends. I open the chat, and there are messages I never sent, threatening my ex and the baby. 

I message this person saying it isn't me, which they don't believe. Immediately get locked out of my account. I try to reset the password. Email is changed, and phone number is removed.

Now, I did immediately file a police report about this and was able to get a screenshot of the different email. Haven't heard anything back yet though. 

But I have a court date in about a week and a half, and I'm really not looking forward to it. I don't know what's happening this time but I'm terrified. 

I've come so close to ending my life too many times in the past six months. The first (and only) attempt (so far), landed me in the ER, followed by a three day stay in a psych unit three hours away. Which didn't do anything for me. I'm at a breaking point, and I won't cut cause I don't want anyone to get mad at me, so then my anxiety spikes and I scratch an arm open or something, which triggers me, and makes me want to cut again. 

I'm in a never-ending cycle of misery and I don't see any other way out. 

If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read through this. Comments are welcome, even thought this was just a mini life story."
3409,"I need help, but don't have the courage to ask","I know people are going to think it's dumb but I've been struggling with depression and wrestling with suicide for awhile. As well as anorexia. I know I need help, I want help but I feel like a burden on everyone in my life if I ask for help or admit to them I need help. I'm the steriotypical push your emotions down guy. Where can I get help from people who don't know me."
3410,I just stepped out of my noose,"I didn’t have three balls to do anything. I called the hotline, but I just sat there for a long time, thinking what I wanted to do, and I just got up"
3411,just wanna vent even if no one sees or cares idk what else to do,"i have been really depressed for over a year now and struggled with depression when I was younger. I got bullied for being gay and got told to kill myself etc etc. I’ve always been extremely shy and had trouble making friends. I didn’t know why I was so scared till I started to realize I have social anxiety. Over a year ago one of my friends left public high school to do online school and I thought it seemed so fun so I did too. But holy fuck am i miserable. I do the same shit every single day so many of my old hobbies i can’t do for more then five minutes cause I just get mentally tired and don’t want to do anything. I never had a lot of friends but online school has seperated me even more and I now have like only two-three friends. My old best friend ran from home to live with a drug dealer and we act like things are okay. But they really aren’t and I feel like I don’t know who she is anymore she’s like a stranger to me. I’ve known her for over ten years and when she met this guy she acted like i didn’t exsist and when i stopped trying I became the bad person. I’ve never had a job because I’m too scared of talking to people all day or messing up at work. I don’t have my license and I’m 18 because I’m too scared due to being in multiple car accidents with friends driving and im terrified i’m going to accidentally hit someone or an animal. I’ve tried multiple medications for anxiety and they haven’t helped at all and I can’t and don’t want any benzodiazepines because I used to abuse them and I’m scared I wouldn’t be able to control myself. I’m on prozac currently and its been the most helpful so far but its also very minimal. I was in a relationship for over a year with an amazing guy and he just broke it off a few days ago. It’s really weird because there was no particular reason why, we we’re a healthy couple and I can’t make myself feel better by saying hes shitty bc he was really great and idk. He was one of the only people that I knew truly cared for me and loved me. It’s crazy just a week ago we were best friends and wanted to spend every minute together and now suddenly were strangers. I think about death often and I’ve lost some pets this year and I sometimes with I wasn’t so scared and would just do it already. I feel bad for my family and people blaming themselves but I am so sick of living like this. I’ve tried to tell my friend but he doesn’t seem like he takes it seriously it’s like im telling a joke or something. And after this breakup happened I relpased on drugs and have been doing lots of adderall cause it’s the only
thing exciting anymore. I’m so behind in my school work from being so sad and just not having motivation and I know I should just do it and try and get caught up but it’s so overwhelming and so much work I have less then a month left to do around 2-3months work of work per class and I’m in 7 classes . I feel like it’s my fault for all of this and I shouldn’t be complaining but I just don’t know a lot of the times I don’t even know why I’m sad I just will randomly start thinking about suicide and how I’d do it and a way for people not to see me when I’m dead. I have this medical condition where I can get really nauseated at anytime of day no matter what’s happening. That makes me even more nervous about getting a job and living a real life I always think about if I were to get nauseated and vomit during an interview or a meeting or talking to a customer. And having social anxiety just makes the nausea worse. I try to take things for anxiety like natural supplements and i got prescribed gabappentin and propanol and I always end up taking way more then I’m supposed to just because I don’t care and feeling just a little euphoria or rush from a drug is better then continuing to be stuck in this loop. I have to graduate this year if I even get ahead I’m terrified because I have to go to a real school and it’s so confusing. I fucking hate doing the same thing everyday and feeling like im in reruns of a tv show but at the same time I don’t have to deal with strangers but then I get lonely and even when I do attempt to hang out with new people I’m extremely quiet and awkward and basically don’t talk the whole time. Idk if anyone at all will read this and if so I’m sorry it’s just this one confusing thick wall of text. I just have no idea what to do with myself anymore and I feel like everyday life just gets worse and worse. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with it."
3412,tired,"I’m so tired of everything in life. 

I wish I was successful. 
I lost interest in everything.  
I think my boyfriend is cheating on me again. 
I wish he showed that he loved and cared about me like he says he does. 
I’m tired of interacting with customers all day. 
I wish I knew what to do with my life.
I can’t stay postive anymore. 
I feel like shit both physically and mentally. 

Idk. I don’t want to deal with anything anymore. I’m so tired. I just want to sleep forever."
3414,"They won, I lost, I give up","The people who treated me like shit in school are all doing well. I'm in my mid-30s, underemployed, no husband, no kids, constant depression, crippling social anxiety. What do I have to show for life? Nothing, I might as well be dead."
3415,I found out I want to die,"Help me. I found out 3 days ago and I want help. Should I tell my dad? I fantasized about death for years. It hurts a ton, like I’ve been stabbed multiple times. Im not happy anymore, only angry. Please help"
3416,cutting self,today i began cutting myself again. i can’t even believe i went two years without it but i can’t take it anymore. i took some pills and started cutting after my parents made me feel really low. i let everyone walk over me and when i stand up i’m in the wrong. i don’t know what to do but cutting was so relieving. i’ve been thinking about going back to it for a very long time and i think it’ll finally help me.
3417,Terrible Experience with Phoning the Crisis Line and the Ottawa Police,"Hello \*\*\*\*\*\*maybe triggering warning?\*\*\*\*

 A little info about myself, I'm male, early 30's, currently living in Ottawa, ON. I've been recently experiencing intense mood lows, have been suffering from depression and anxiety issues since I was a young child, and have attempted suicide a few times in the past.  I have never been taken to the hospital against my own volition before and have gone each time I've felt extremely negative emotions in the past. There should also be a medical record of this.

I work night shifts. While at work the other night I had experienced one such mood drop. I had called the crisis line in hopes of getting a few phone numbers with which I could call after my shift was done to try and arrange appointments for counselling or therapy, also to acquire myself a GP as I currently don't have one.

The man I spoke with on the phone didn't seem to care at all what I was saying to him and kept repeating platitudes about how he 'knows how much pain I must be in' or 'I'm here to help'. He repeatedly asked if I had ways of hurting myself or if I had a plan, to which I replied ""well yeah, of course I have ideas. There's half a dozen ways I could kill myself at work alone. Whether it be through pills, falling down the stairs, walking in front of a bus outside. Electrocuting myself with my lunch fork in a socket, none of that matters.' It required a lot of talking in circles to actually pull the numbers from him and when I finally did it just sounded like he was reading from a script again, he had to ensure I wasn't gonna hurt myself, etc. to which I replied, 'Shouldn't me asking for help and these numbers be proof enough?' He went on as if literally reading from a document in front of him without even listening to me so I eventually hung up on him. He called back once and left a message which was once again some bullshit he had already told me not but 5 minutes prior.

20 minutes or so later I get a call that there are police officers at my mother's home who are looking for me just to 'talk'. They reiterated this point numerous times as I over heard them speaking to my mother. I was told that there were officers outside of my work right that minute who wanted to have a word with me. I told my mother to tell them that I would speak to them but am not going with them. 

(I have had numerous bad experiences while being in the hospital in the past and i find it extremely upsetting to sit in a strange, grubby, featureless, pastel painted room away from all of things I do find comforting like my home, the things I enjoy, and sleep, which does sometimes pull me out of a funk. On past occasions I've attempted to learn about any out patient services during prior visits and have learned to take advantage of them when I can. Also most nurses and doctors in this city don't seem to give two shits about anyone they see, plus they are all being overworked as they only ever have 1 or 2 of them working each night to see to any number of patients that come and go through.)

Eventually I go outside to speak with the 2 officers waiting for me. To which they immediately identify me, while half a dozen people stare onward from the bus stop nearby, and ask if I'd like to chat in the back of their car. Anyone who's had the misfortune of being in the back of a cruiser will know how uncomfortable and cramped they are and I'm 6"" tall and of an average build, I would have had to sit sideways and still be wedged in. To this I replied 'No' and they then asked if they could speak to me inside. My work locks all doors leading outside at night (I would have needed a fellow worker to let me back in after my chat) and so I offered the idea that we could chat maybe further down the sidewalk, away from the gawkers.  Both officers came off initially aggressive and handsy, even hastily grabbing (and not returning later) my work box cutter, which was quite literally too dull to cut anyone's skin. They also each positioned themselves on either side of me as if to 'pen me in' if I started to flee.

This 'talk'  was abrupt, both officers were rude and accusatory to and of me. I told them everything that happened on my call with the crisis line and my plans for the night, which were to finish my shift, go home, and sleep off my depressive feelings. I also informed them of the numbers I got from the crisis line and my intent to call them later. In this I began to get snippy and rude in kind with their questioning as once again it just devolved into me repeating myself and my intentions.  At this point I was told to be cooperative and that's when it dawned on me that they were gonna take me regardless of what I said to them as a third officer came driving up quickly, the three of them did more 'pinning' while they took up positions apart as if I was about to run. With my anxiety, and fear of hospitals I didn't like how the situation so quickly devolved. They were once again, not people who were interested in anything I had to say.

Almost as soon as the third officer had arrived they rushed me, grabbing both of my arms while the third officer made a call in. In the scuffle one of them jostled me hard and knocked my glasses off. Me not being a very wealthy man who cant just buy a pair of frames any time I damn well want, particularly this close to Christmas, became worried that I suddenly might have my glasses stepped on and not be able to see properly for a while. 

They inevitably tipped me foreward and i raised my head back so i wouldn't face plant into the sidewalk and landed hard on my shoulder. They had attempted twisting my arms and legs and wrestled with me until I gave up and let them handcuff me. All the while I had fallen on top of my glasses and was trying my hardest to avoid putting my torsos weight on them as they would have been grinded into the pavement. One of them even set his knee against my spine and pushed which made this particularly hard. I made several comments about my glasses which went unheard, more telling evidence that no one gave two shits about anything I had to say this night. I was handcuffed roughly, both of which were cutting off circulation to my hands and the officers had fiddled with the cuffs, cutting up my wrists and the backs of my hands. Also during the cuffing procedure one of the officers placed his hand against the back of my head and pushed my forehead against the pavement hard ( I now have scratches and bruises across the side of my forehead that go down to my cheekbone. With them leading me I crawled into the back of one of their cruisers.

After being taken to the Montford and aggressively led to a room I was given back all of my things taken from me (except my work box cutter knife which isn't technically even mine) and had to wait approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours in handcuffs before a doctor could tell me that I was given a form 42 but could forgo the 72 hour incarceration and not be charged with assault of an officer if I waited till approximately noon so I could speak to someone from the psychiatric team. I spent my morning not getting the rest I sorely needed, covered in fresh scrapes and bruises, and in dirty clothes from being ran into the sidewalk outside while a poor elderly security officer had to watch me from the hallway the whole time.

I was released around 1 in the afternoon with 3 more numbers to call, 2 of which were numbers I had actually gotten from the crisis line. I had to endure the cold in my thin sweater, travel back to work, grab my things and winter jacket since I wasn't even allowed to grab them when I attempted to cooperate and go with the police, then travel back home. All of which took approximately another 2 hours.

The whole event was humiliating, degrading, insulting, and did nothing to help someone suffering in my situation. I was ignored the entire time and treated like garbage and a dangerous person by people I assumed were here to protect me. I pity anyone in this city who's had a similar incident and have greatly lost faith in the police force and how mental health is handled in this city.

Word to the wise, never vent or hang up on the Crisis Line."
3418,I tried everything I could.,I hope when you go through my phone after I pass and you find my posts on reddit you know how much I tried. I hope you see I reached out to everyone I could including strangers. Nothing helped and nothing ever will. I’m sorry I did this to myself and consequently hurt everyone around me but please know how sorry I am to have waited this long.
3419,Does anyone know how to stop being afraid,I’ve been trying to kill myself for 5 years now. Each time I was too afraid to do it. Does anyone have any way to get rid of it. I know that I won’t be able to get rid of all the fear but just enough for me to kill myself. Please help with it. Also if anyone would like to give me a relatively painless way to commit suicide I’m all for that too. So far all I have is just hanging
3420,"Today is my birthday. If I do it tonight, at least the few people who cared about me will only have one sad day a year instead of two.","Instead of having someone grieve on a death date and a birth date, why not kill two birds with one stone (pun intended) and get it all over with in one day.  
I've been in so much physical and emotional pain my entire life and I've finally had enough with it. NFamily won't care. I don't have friends to care. I'm alone. I'm thinking about it so often again. It's gotten to the point of any time I pass an object or situation with potential to kill myself with, I think about how easy it would be. Everything hurts so much I don't know how much longer I can continue. I'll probably become paralyzed in the next ten years anyway. I don't want to let a disease kill me, it might take too long. Thanks for coming to my tedtalk and listen to me being a sad bitch"
3421,No one would even notice I was gone,Sure my parents would be sad but genuinely I feel I’ve added nothing to the world. Guys it’s not even that I’m sad or depressed or anything I’m just so tired of living life this way. I wish I had the stones to do something about it.
3422,I'm gonna kill myself before 2020 starts,"A new decade starts, but my shitty loser life ends right here"
3423,I think I’m gonna buy a gun tomorrow,Any suggestions?
3424,I'm doing it after this semester ends.,"I've been putting it off for the last 4 years. But growth is minimal and success is minimal as well. Almost 20 years and a sophomore in community college and I'm severely lacking in all areas. On my current track I might need an extra year to transfer, on top of that I am not enough for the Computer Science officer position in my club. The classes keep getting more frustrating and I'm lacking in every area in life. At the end of the day it's survival of the fittest, if I am not capable enough then I need to perish, sometimes I have to take things in my own hands and save myself from the future pain. 

There is alot of cool stuff that I gotta experience this year. Halo Reach on PC it was awesome to play that. Avengers Endgame and also Star Wars Episode 9 when I get to watch that in a week or two. But in January after everything is settled I'm going to do it. It'll suck not being able to see the next Marvel or Star Wars movies, the avengers game, diamond and pearl remakes, Doom eternal, new smash bros characters. But that's life, sometimes you need to make the right decision in order to make it easier. 

I have things I need to put in order before I do it to make this transition as smooth as possible. I need to make sure my engineering club officer is passed on to the right person. I already know this person and he would do a much better job than me compared to me now. I also need to quit my IT job so that way there is nothing disturbed with my work shifts and everything.

Once that is in place I'll go to the forest preserve near my house overdose on some OTC medication as a precaution and I'll hang myself in an isolated place. That's where my story will end."
3425,Everything is falling down,"My great-aunt is bedridden until she gets her hip replacement surgery, my grandfather needs treatment for something related to his thyroid gland, my mom has digestive problems and her high blood pressure is fluctuating a lot... And my grandmother is burning herself out by working in our ministore, cooking and doing other stuff.

There's a huge weight on my shoulders... I don't have a job, and have little to no skills to get one, my family is ill and I can't do anything...

Every single day is the same thing, study, go to college, make homework, be almost alone, struggle with depression... It's far too much... I don't know why all of this is happening to my family, they aren't bad people, they don't deserve this...

Right now... I feel like I want to end it all, I'm not strong enough to be the pillar my family needs... It's too much suffering..."
3426,One thing after another,"2019 has been the roughest year on me mentally over any other year in my life. Recently things have been getting really bad in my life. Basically attempted suicide last week by getting severely intoxicated and taking some ibuprofen and hydrocodone cough syrup. Didn’t even realize it was maybe a suicide attempt until a few day’s later. And yesterday and today were really rough on me after a really hard week. Got excited over something and then once again, I get knocked back down, even farther. I’m sick of living life this way. I think I’m cursed or doomed."
3427,Maybe i'm just not good enough.,Maybe I just wasn't meant to get this far. You know? Maybe I do need to commit suicide. My life's a joke. Im too much of a pussy to even kiss my boyfriend (Ironic cuz im gay). Im gonna flunk out of college. Then what? That's my life. I need to just fucking end it now. Before my life somehow becomes even more of a fucking joke.
3428,Contradictions,"It is really confusing how I want to be isolated and alone, but also wish I could talk to someone. I have plenty of people to talk to, I have a lot to be grateful for. But just existing is so difficult - even when nothing in particular is wrong. I don't know why that is, how to explain that. It makes me feel like such a complainer. Sometimes I feel like I'm making all of this up. But these feelings of dread and numbness don't feel fake, they feel overwhelming. 

I have people who want to help me, but I don't know if I want help. I know it's the right thing to do. Part of me says, ""Do the work! Try to get better! Fight!"" But a much larger part of me says, ""Just let yourself spiral until it's too late.""  

I have a husband and a kid who would be devastated if I let it get to be ""too late."" I love them and want to try, but ending it is all I can think about."
3429,What am I suppose to be fighting for?,"What if I don’t actually give a damn about college? What if there’s no career that interests me? What if I don’t care about getting married, having kids, or owning a house? Why bother spending my entire life working at a shitty job I don’t want to be at to support my shitty life I don’t want to live? 

What’s wrong with giving up when I know that realistically, this is all my life is ever going to be. A miserable grind towards... what exactly?"
3430,I don’t know how to not be a burden.,"They’d never admit it, but I know I am a burden to everyone I love. We’ve been going through this same shit for the past 8 years. I’m so tired of it, how could they not be. I don’t blame them because I’m such a bitch to everyone in my family and to my long term boyfriend. I’m a liar and incredibly manipulative even when I’m not trying to be. Honestly, I’m a bad person. 

No one knows I’ve been having these thoughts and hurting myself. I don’t want to disappoint them again when they all think I’m doing good. I have no reason to feel this way. I have a good job and I know my family loves me. I guess I’m just selfish. I work with kids. I know they’d be confused if I stopped showing up to school. And it’s still not enough for me. I’m so lazy and self centered I can only think of my own pain. I just hope my family knows I love them, I’ll do my best to make it so they don’t have to find me. This is going to ruin my father. 

I’m buying some Xanax this week, probably tomorrow. I’m really small so hopefully it’ll be enough.  I don’t know why I’ve written this. I know no one will see it and it wouldn’t make a difference even if someone did. Sorry."
3431,Sitting in my small room contemplating ways of taking my own life., I have been suffering with mental health issues for the past year and a half and I haven't looked for help haven't told many people and sometimes on nights like this I just let it all out but there's to much to get out. Religion won't help me nobody will if your reading this please don't become like me help yourself now .
3432,Can’t seem to get through it,"I’m sorry I just feel it’s too much sometimes.

I’ve struggled with alcoholism for almost 2 years now, the mental health team don’t want to speak to me until I’m sober, and the alcohol team have literally done nothing for me. 
I’m trying so hard but all I can feel is that I’m this fat disgusting embarrassing mess. I know everyone has problems but I’m really suffering tonight. Trying my hardest not to self harm. My boyfriend is asleep next to me and I just wish I could be. I’m sorry."
3433,What is the point of living a long life,
3434,Not sure anymore,"I don't know why but everytime something nice happens either someone else or me has ruined it. For the last few years I feel like I've done more ""harm"" to other people in place of joy. A couple of days ago I feel like I ruined something important to me. I don't fully wanna go into the how or what but I feel like in the end I just mess everything up and/or hurt people around me. So is it even worth living if in the end I just mess everything up or hurt people?"
3435,Tried killing myself the other night,I failed:( drank a lot and took some pain killers. Idk how that didn’t do the trick. I don’t have any more.  that would’ve been such an easy way to go. Idk what to try next
3436,My friend might commit suicide,He’s always making comments about killing himself. He’s gotten into therapy and was recently diagnosed with depression and is now on antidepressants. He still makes comments about him wanting to die and how life is pointless and tries to assure me he wont kill himself but I’m still worried for him. Im scared that one day I might find out he killed himself. What can I do?
3437,tomorrow is my birthday,my si is super high and i don’t know how to act!!
3438,I’m not looking for help. Just simple answers. How much Vicodin do I need to end it ?im tired.,
3439,I’m thinking about sleeping for good again,"I’m thinking about leaving everything behind even though I had plans for my future. In this moment, I don’t care. I’ll write one last note and say goodbye to everyone.  

I know there’s people that won’t take it easy, and I know there’s people that will follow my same fate (I’m certain that one person will at least) but I hope they’ll reconsider and get the help they need.   

I hope my parents will know that they did absolutely nothing to help me. They attempted to isolate me from my friends and refused to let me get meds when I felt I needed them. They shamed me for my body and I’ll never forget it.  

I hope those bullies in the past know that they finally got what they wanted. They told me to go die and that’s exactly what you’re getting now. You’re welcome."
3440,Just advice for people.,"I encourage people to sort by new, not just looking at the popular. There's a lot of people that could use a friend, but we miss that by letting them fall into the void of posts..."

3443,10/16/01 - 12/9/19 today I will kill myself,I'm sick of living in a failure and a retard and make people suffer and can't help it and I'm a bad person so I am going to die and no one will see this  before i do it and people who do if anyone wont care I have attempted suicide twice now and this time im going to make it successful
3444,Contemplating doing it.,"I have wanted to end my life for some time. It started when my father killed himself back in 2011. This year has been particularly hard on me. I've never been this comfortable with taking my life. My fear of death has dwindled substantially. I don't see a point to keep struggling in an uphill battle. It's such a painful existence to deal with every day. People can be so cruel and vicious. I want it to end so badly but no matter how hard I try, I can't bring myself to do it."
3445,How to make my parents not miss me?,What should I do to make them grateful for my death? I don't want to be alive anymore but I don't want to make them feel bad about my death.
3446,I Am Tired,"I am tired of feeling lonely,I am tired of all the darkness, I am tired of being a burden, I am tired of being a bother, I am tired of not being productive, I am tired of staying home, I am tired of staying alive, I am tired of wanting to die.."
3447,It's one of those nights where I have enough of my anxiety,"Well, it's one of those kinds of nights where your anxiety and fears keep you awake and make you fall deeper and deeper into that depression hole. It's exhausting, and I feel fed up about it.

I have clinical depression and anxiety, and for me personally, fucking up my sleeping schedule pushes me into a deep downwards spiral evertime. Not being able to sleep because I'm afraid of dying and all the other little things, then sleeping until 5pm once I finally managed to drift away to sleep, and missing class, work, dates, meetups with friends. Getting more depressed. More anxiety. Even less sleep. It's so exhausting.

I tried many meds, they all don't work. They either turn me into a mentally numb and sexually impotent NPC, or they give me hideous side effects. I tried many of them. 

Therapy, well I tried getting therapy. I'm on two waiting lists. 9 months they said until I can realistically expect a slot. More like 12 in reality. That's a long time. There is no other help. I feel helpless and fed up about it.

I started to feel things I haven't felt before recently. Thoughts that maybe ending it would stop the pain. That the pain just isn't worth the small benefits I ripe from live anymore. Why endure it all, I ask myself. I don't find an answer.

I'm in a marriage, I have a wife, no kids. I would like to say that I love her, and I know that I did, and that the real, healthy me does, but I don't feel those feelings. Especially not in a night like this. Not right now. And I know that she's there for me everytime I need her, bless her kind soul, but it doesn't do anything. Hasn't in a long time. Isn't her fault that I can't feel anything. It's all so numb.

The thought of what killing myself would do to her kept me from these thoughts for a long time. But now? I'm beginning to get the feeling that maybe, it would be better for her too. This scares me. Especially right now.

I feel like my problems don't matter as much as others - I am sure the average person here would say that I do have a good life, good income, good living situation, family, a dog. But it becomes so meaningless when you can't feel anything anymore. But yet I don't tell my friends. They have it all way worse than me. Can't afford rent, life paycheck to paycheck. I help out where I can. Sometimes giving financial gifts makes me feel something, at least for a short moment. So I do that where I can. It's the least I could do.


Thank you for reading this. I am not sure if I am going to commit suicide today. Haven't even planned a method yet. So probably not. We will see. But if not, I am sure it's gonna happen sooner than later, because I feel mentally read and at peace with the idea."
3448,Why am I around?,"Honestly though, why? 

All I ever seem to do is spread misery wherever i go. I worry people too much, I indirectly stop people from being happy bc of how depressing I am. Hell my own girlfriend is getting anxiety bc she thinks I may one day end it all. And tbh, she's right... it's a possibility. Not one I like to consider, but it's a possibility. I've been dealing with my depression for a little over a year now, and all I seem to do is make things worse for everyone else. So I ask, to all of you who are possibly older, smarter, or wiser. Is this all really worth it. Bc sometimes it sure doesnt feel like it."
3449,I want to back to high school so badly,High school was great but sadly I fucked up my senior year. I regret my mistakes in high school everyday. I can’t stand it and I wish I was back there. I would rather blow my brains out then accept what has happened.
3450,Why do I have to live a life I don't want to live?,"I just don't understand.  I've been to the hospital, they hospitalized me for almost 2 months and then sent me to a child protection center for another month.  They don't want to help me.  I've tried the therapy to the best of my ability, but it still isn't enough, the medication doesn't work.  Nothing is work, I'm broken; I'll be like this forever.  The only people that care about me are my family and it is really upsetting to me that I would hurt them gravely by ending myself.  But I don't want to keep suffering like this, I can't.  I have a bottle of Tylenol hidden in my room, I am still debating to use it or not.  If I'm open with the doctors at the hospital, I'm just going to get sent back to child protection and that really scares me.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I don't want to live this life."
3451,intrusive and obsessive thoughts..,"about doing pretty bad and possibly fatal things

the worst part is that I'm used to it, it feels weird when I don't want to kill myself anymore"
3452,Anyone here survived a suicide bag?,
3453,I hate my life and want to die,"I wish I could just die in my sleep some nights. I hate being alone. I hate struggling with abandonment and trust issues. I hate that I don’t have family. My friends are great but no one is here tonight. I just feel unloved, unheld, and no one really has time for me."
3454,I’m so fucking done,I can’t do it anymore. I’ve been depressed ever since I can remember (I’m 17) and I hate myself because deep down I know I have no right to be this sad. My life is perfect and I don’t know why I can’t appreciate that. I’m only happy when I’m drunk or high and just making it through the day sober is a struggle for me. My whole life is slowly crumbling and I do t even care. I have friends but even when I’m with them I feel alone. I can’t maintain a relationship because I’m too self destructive and I’m horrible at showing emotions. I love a girl so much and I want to try to start something but I don’t know if it’s even worth it
3455,Unsent Text,"""The truth is I've been suicidal for months. I don't tell people because it's stupid and I don't like bringing them down, plus, I know that it's super rare for people to care when you don't actually do it. People say if you were really suicidal, you wouldn't say anything. But they tell you to tell someone to get help. I know the only reason I don't do it is because Morty and Slater, but I don't think I'd be alive if they left me. You guys all have a lot of friends, and I only have you. I don't really matter to more than three people, and if I died, those people would be able to replace me. Things have changed over the years and I haven't been able to adapt. I constantly get mad at myself for maintaining relationships when I could have disappeared and offed myself where nobody would notice. Everyone would have assumed I just moved on. The fact that you've become more social since we lived together is a great fucking thing, you're very happy, you've got a lot of good things going for you, but I'm on the sidelines, and the shittiest part is I deserve to be. I'm not a good friend, I'm not even a good person. I'm not fun anymore, and I've tried for a quarter of a year to fix that now. I can't drink, I can't relax, I'm not the person that I was when we met, and it fucking kills me that I'll never be that person again. I regret living past the apartment, because my life stopped actually meaning anything at that point. I wanted to die then, and I don't know why I was too much of a coward to do it when I had even fewer people that would have been impacted by it. I would have died a good person, somebody that would have been missed and loved, rather than what I am now. I drunkenly said shit that I didn't mean because I thought it'd stop you from leaving me. It didn't work, and now I know it probably disgusted you. I'm a fucking failure. You can't stand to be around me. You promised me you'd call, and I knew that I shouldn't expect you to, because I'm not the type of person anybody wants to call. We were supposed to go together, but I know you went with other friends. Again, I can't blame you. I wouldn't want to be friends with me, either. I know that nostalgia plays a big role in a lot of these things, remembering how people used to be. I'm sorry that I couldn't continue being the person that you loved all those years ago.""

I sent a text to my best friend seeing if she'd talk to me as I was having difficulty not hurting myself, and I found out she went to an event I told her I wanted to go to with her. She promised me she'd call today, but it's 9 p.m. where I live, and she hasn't even responded to any of the casual texts I've sent to try and cover up the fact that I needed her last night. The drunken text thing references once when she told me she had feelings for me and I played along hoping she wouldn't move states. We now live in the same state again. I didn't know where else to post this."
3456,Is alcohol poisoning a good way to go?,"I've done some extensive research on suicide methods this last month or so; and I originally wanted to go out with a pill overdose. Turns out overdosing on common drugs is harder &amp; more painful than it seems, &amp; everything else you'd need a prescription for. The only thing I really have access to right now is alcohol, I've done a little bit of research on it but I can't know for sure what alcohol poisoning is like since I haven't tried it yet. Could I get any advice on this topic?"
3457,I had my first real episode last night.,"Intro:
I'm 20 years old, and I've always had mental health problems, and I attribute lot of that to my household. I love my parents and I love my brothers and sisters. But ever since I was a kid, everytime I told them what I wanted to be when I grew up, they made fun of me. When I said I wanted to be an actor, they called me a wannabe Tom Cruise. Stuff like that. Everytime I had a passion for something, they would make fun of me for doing it. They love to point out all of my flaws daily and make me feel bad for them. It deteriorated my mental health to where now I don't even think I have a future anymore. I produce beats now and I love it, but I keep it far away from my family. It feels like I won't live long enough to make something out of myself. 

Last Night:
Last night was the closest I ever got to actually killing myself. I'm too much of a coward to use a knife or hang myself. I was on the verge of just walking out of my house, leaving a note, and going far into the desert and just lay there until I eventually die of starvation or dehydration. I felt like it was hurt the least. I was laying in bed thinking about how I truly do not want to continue down my path and just get it over with now. I cut off almost all of my friends today. 2 of which I've been close friends for over 5 years. I've been feeling just so lifeless all day today and I'm getting the same feeling again as I'm typing. I have nothing going for me at the moment. No car, no job, no girlfriend, no set future plans. Nothing. I feel it would just be easier for me and my family if I get it over with already. Anyways, thank you for reading to those who actually read this far along."
3458,Not really me attempting suicide but just wanting to vent things :/,"I tend to get in arguments with my mom often about random things. I have slight anger issues and when she yells at me for something small I either get angry or break down into tears. 

I have had times where I cut myself after these arguments, which she doesn't know about, and cry my heart out.

Today I had a bad day and was trying hard to not go into the kitchen, grab a bottle of random pills, and swallow them all. My mom started getting mad and yelled about how my brother, dad, and I are giving eachother weird and stupid things for Christmas. 

I got triggered by how she was yelling at me for something that she is insisting my dad thought of but it was me. She kept saying how he was using dating sites and shit that are expensive and kept ignoring what I was saying. 

When she left the room, she closed my door and I just started sobbing. I've been able to quiet my crying so she nor my brother could hear me.

 I'm now on my bed crying while physically and mentally straining myself to not go to the kitchen to either slash my wrists with a knife or like I said at the beginning to swallow a bunch of pills.

I don't have any razors in my room because I usually cut in the bathroom to avoid any blood on my bed.

I dont usually cut to the point it bleeds but just to know that I'm feeling pain and can see the short slashes.

I don't have anything to do to sleep from how I feel but I shouldn't be using my phone.

I mostly cut to get myself to sleep but now I can't.

I've tried scratching but it doesn't have the same effect.

the most dangerous thing I have with me right now is my mind and what I'm thinking of."
3459,I’m so lonely,"I’m planning on doing it this week. I can’t talk to anybody because I’m (16) homeschooled and don’t play any sports. But just that im so lonely I think I don’t want to spend the rest of my life like this. My birthday was 2 days ago but everyone one forgot or was too busy but I knew that would happen so I didn’t plan anything
It’s just my thoughts and me. My parents don’t understand I’ve told them that I want go to public school so I at least go out the house once a day but they say that they don’t agree with me and I just have to deal with it"
3460,There is no point for me to continue,"I have a fucking Christmas tree. Why? For my kids. Keeping up appearances. Everything I do is fucking fake. Smile, fake, positive talk, fake, get dressed and go through the day, fake. Fuck everything.  These dark fucking days are so dark and they’re getting worse.  I didn’t think it could get worse, but holy fuck, it’s getting darker. I’m alone all the time. No one gives a fuck about me. I don’t want to hear the family/kids argument. They’ll be fine. NO ONE gives a fuck."
3461,is it just me,"sorry to sound like an edgelord but does anyone else think about what state of decomposition they’d like to be found in?

i used to not want to be found at all, or found relatively quickly, because i was really vain and i was scared of my body becoming uglier than it is. i used to be really afraid of decay actually, or the general deterioration of my body

but now i want to die in a body of water or something and just get really disgusting. or to die alone in the middle of summer with no one to check in or care while i rot in the heat until my corpse becomes rancid enough to disturb other people

it’s not even anything besides how much i hate myself. i don’t deserve somebody in a morgue staring down at me, similar to how i was in life, and thinking about what a tragedy it is that i died with my whole life ahead of me. i don’t deserve that kind of care. i don’t deserve to be easily identifiable so that when they call my family they can crowd around me and cry and beg god to bring me back. i don’t deserve grief. all i deserve is revulsion"
3462,This year may be my breaking point,"Please read, I know it's long but please.

I'm 16. Around a year ago, the love of my life(18) left. We could hardly see each other and it was hard on the both of us. It all but killed me. It almost did a few times... I wish I had successfully finished the job. I'm such a failure I couldn't even od right. The break up might have been the worst thing to me, but it was only the beginning of the longest, most painful year of my life. A few weeks later, my sister and I were forced into a New Year's 5 day ""vacation"" with my mom, little step brother(6), and my mother's husband (step douche or SD). SD has always hated me, he's cussed me out, hit me, screamed at me, threatened me, etc. It went mostly well... Until the last day. My little brother wanted to go on the small ice skating rink. Thing is, I have really, really bad anxiety. This actually keeps me from normal daily activities, and from doing things I enjoy/want to do. There was SO MANY PEOPLE, so skating wasn't an option for me. SD got pissed, yelled at me and called me ungrateful and disrespectful and selfish and told us we were staying yet another day (he knew that would set me off, I hate being around them) and i lost it. I told him, ""f*ck no we aren't I'm sorry for my language but I can't do this anymore."" And walked away. We soon left, the ride to the hotel was silent. We got there, me and my sister started packing. Here comes the hell. SD starts screaming again telling me and my sister to get the **** out of his ******* hotel room, blah blah, and he starts coming up the stairs. I run to the bathroom connected to my sister's bedroom and lock the door while she locks the bedroom door... God knows what would've happened if we didn't. He beats on the door, screaming and threatening us, saying very violent things. He's still beating on the door, kicking it, screaming, then calls the cops to come remove us for trespassing. My mom secretly called them back and quickly explained the situation. My little 6 yr old brother was crying telling us to please come out of the room so his dad would stop yelling. This absolutely broke me to hear. I didn't open the door. The police came, were super nice, helped us out and carried mine and my sisters stuff, and took us to the head office of the hotel about 2 minutes away. We waited 4 hours for my dad to drive there and pick us up. A few months later, I was put on a new medication (anxiety and depression stuff) and it ended up making me have 4 seizures. One at home alone after school, one at school (the only one they took me to the hospital for), another at home alone (thankfully on my bed this time, still broke stuff on my side table, busted my lip, bit my tongue HARD, and had a know on my head), then the last one while I was asleep. I'm failing my classes, I failed my driving test (I got it the 2nd time tho so I have my license now!), everyday is full of yelling, I have to give my Axolotl away cause I can't take care of him properly, my friend tried to overdose... Me and my ex still talk sometimes. Very rarely though. We were supposed to get back together when I turned 16. He'd be able to drive then, have his own place. When he told me there was hope for us I had reason to live again. I felt happiness again. But his mom was hospitalized and he got evicted. He had to move even farther away. We didn't get back together because of this. He told me he still wishes there could be something between us again, but because of the distance, there can't be. 

I don't want to be here for so many reasons. There isn't a day that does by that I don't think about him or daydream what could be. I have dreams about him. In my dreams I'm so unbelievably happy, then I wake up to reality. I want to die so fucking badly. It hurts so bad.."
3463,I'm a failure.,"My life has been filled with plenty of wonderful people, yet I feel like the world would just be better without me. I'm 19 and still in high school because of problems with mental health in the past and basically missed 2 whole years of high school because I couldn't get out of bed because my anxiety was so bad. Being 19 and still in high school fucking sucks. Seeing all of your friends going to college, getting jobs, buying cars, and all of this other adult stuff while I'm sitting here still trying to finish high school. I feel like I've let me parents, family, and friends down even though they have all been supportive of me. I feel after I am finally done with high school is when it should be my time. I will be graduating either by the end of this year or the beggining of next year depending on how the year goes. I have come very close to ending it before then, but I would like my friends and family to see me finish something that I and they would never have thought that could happen. I would of course like to live longer, but I really dont think I can. I would probably be living in my parents house my whole life with no job, no girlfriend, and will eventually have to see my parents die and then I will have nothing. My anxiety had been controlling my life since I was 11 and it has only gotten worse so I feel like getting a job is going to be impossible for me as I would not be able to man up and just do it. I think it would just be better for me to end it sooner than later as it would put less stress on my parents, family, and friends. I dont even know where I'm going with this anymore I'm just mentally exhausted and just want it to be over."
3464,Ahh tonight the thoughts started coming back in and I was scared that I was going to attempt. I’ve been texting some friends and they’ve been helping me,
3465,Overdose question,"Will overdosing on 5,000+mg of hydrocodone/APAP and 10+mg if Xanax hurt? I know it’s a dumb question and I’m not looking for people to talk too."
3466,I think I'm having 2nd thoughts...,"Apologies for the format and the grammar of this post.. Its 2:07am where I am and I've had a whole bottle of whisky to myself..

For Years I've had these thoughts daily.. Its gotten to a point where I don't give a shit about my only passion anymore (football / soccer).. I actually don't really care about anything anymore... 

I live every day on a sort of autopilot.. Wake up, eat breakfast, work, come home and do fuck all with my life... This includes weekends.. 

My birthday (26) is in just over a week from now and due to work commitments my parents came over to my apartment today to celebrate. My dad brought in this massive box which had a gaming chair inside which we both put together..

Every single day without fail, for the past few months prior to today I've told myself ""stop giving a fuck.. Come January you'll be gone.."" and that was my kinda mantra / purpose in life.. Suicide has been in the back of my mind since I was 21 but 2019 has been the lowest of the low for me.. 

Why January? I told myself to get myself through xmas / new year just for my parents sake.. 2020 xmas would be 11 months from my plan which I'm guessing would be easier to live through than if it was 1 month and I went through with it today. 

I won't go into detail into my fuckton of personal / mental issues but my kinda shield / prevention mechanism was my parents..

From about September my issues worsened.. I stopped going out with my friends** and excluded myself from any social outings.. I was always the fun drinking buddy but nobody gave a flying fuck that I wasn't there..

Anyway..  Because of that I even got to the point where I didn't give a shit about how my parents would feel.. My mum probably has her suspicions because she always asks ""are you ok? You look down"" and id always answer the standard ""I'm fine"" 

Now.. After receiving this gift approx 12 hours ago I feel this massive guilt.. My parents are the only people that actually give a shit and I'm starting to feel horrible about them having to bury or cremate their only child... 

Today was the first day in a long time I actually had 2nd thoughts about pulling through with my January plan..  For the first time I'm actually confused and I don't know what to do.. I feel so fucking lost right now ..

 **work colleagues... I only have 1 friend outside of my 9-5 dead end job.. 

The time is now 02:49 which means I've spent over 40 minutes writing this post.. Perhaps one of you will read this and give me another outlook or maybe some guidance.. I dno... Im gonna hit post and see what.. If anything comes up in the morning.."
3467,Important Question,"So... I wrote this suicide letter (that I never finished) six years ago because I was just too tired that day to actually complete the process. Every now and then I like to look for it and reread it so I can remind myself of where/who I was then, and be proud of where/who I am now. 

Is it wrong that I kept it?"
3468,My account hit -$10,"I’m out of $. Stripping hasn’t made me anything and since that’s all I’ve been able to do to hide the fact I had fired from my waitressing job after my manager asked me to fuck him, I said no, and was then fired for “stealing”, I’m at a loss. I’m waiting to hear back from a few places I’ve applied at. But my account is at -$10. Tomorrow morning I’ll get an overdraft fee. I could walk to the bank the next town over, but then I won’t be able to afford going to the shitty club job I hate tomorrow. I already owe them money. I owe my school over $800. I still owe rent for the month. I’m so in debt. Like that’s not even including my student loans and unpaid medical bills. And I can’t ask my parents for money again. Not when they think I still have a real job and Christmas is coming. But I can’t sign up for classes until this student debt is paid. And this guy I’ve been stupidly in love with for the past three years has been shitting on me the past few days saying none of my anxieties over global warming and the poor getting poorer matters because his dads rich and he’ll be fine. So he doesn’t give a fuck. That’s literally his reasoning. I just. I don’t see good in the world. I don’t see good in anything. And I’ve been going minute to minute just trying to make it to finals without swallowing every pill I own. And tbh I don’t know I’m make it through tonight without doing it."
3469,I'm tired.,"I've always been depressed. Since I was a preteen. Recently, my only sister was in a car accident. My youngest nephew died on scene. My oldest nephew was brain dead and they kept him alive for days. He was the only one out of the three children that knew me. I was by her side throughout the process. I had to give my baby sister showers again. I had to clean her wounds. I had to look her in the eye when she knew that her child on a ventilator was going to die but everyone was telling her to pray. She had hope but we both knew. I had to watch her give up hope. When it was time, I had to listen to them name every body part that they wanted to take from my nephew and listen to my sister scream and cry. They didn't give her time to process. I know it was a good thing that she donated his body but it's so hard to deal with. I want to die. I thought about it today as I have many times. The only thing that kept me from doing so is that my boyfriend wouldn't wake up if I called to him. I'm so tired. I always have been and now it seems I have a reason to go. I want to. I'm so fucking tired."
3470,I hate being alive so much,"I’ve been struggling with depression for a long time, I want to kill myself so badly. To make things worse my husband told me a couple days ago “I’m not in love with you anymore” and told me he’s leaving me. I don’t blame him, I’ve lost any sense of my former self, what’s there left to love? But it still cuts deep enough to really make me want to go ahead and do it. The only thing keeping me here is thinking about the pain my mother &amp; siblings would go through and so far I can’t imagine putting them through that. But I don’t know how much longer that will keep me afloat. I used to be a spiritual person, now when I talk to God I’m asking him to kill me in my sleep or let me get hit by a car or something so I don’t have to actually commit suicide. Fuck this life fuck this world I hate it and I’m sick of holding on just for it to get worse and worse"
3471,i feeel like killing myself,im just tired and i feel like the easiest escape wpuld be ending it all
3472,I hate it here.,"I’m just in so much pain that it feels unbearable and never ending. I can’t say that I want to kill myself...per say....but I definitely don’t want to here anymore. 

Constant misery. - face palm -"
3473,My good bye letter. Should I write something more personal to those I deem too important to leave them without one ? Or will this just cause them more pain?,"Dear everyone,

I wish it was that easy to just ""overcome it, you'll see, life gets better"" because no, I do not see it.

If I ever leave (and if you read this I am hoping I am already gone) just know I'm in a better place; that death has long become my security blanket. And I'm finally safe.

It is nobody's fault except my own: I am too sensitive or maybe just too overwhelmed. I tried so hard to live a normal life, but my shoulders keep on getting heavier and heavier, and the world keeps on getting uglier and uglier.

I wish for you to see me as the Laetitia you have always known and seen, as the Laetitia you want to remember me as. It can be anything. If my death hurts you too much, I allow you to hate me. If my death pains you too much, then I hope you will get through it because ""you'll see, life gets better"".

I have always found this world abusive and horrendous. It is not how I want to live the rest of my life: to live for everyone else to enjoy my presence, when myself I do not enjoy being in presence of anyone but Death. 

It is a hard thing to do, kill yourself. You would think I chose the easiest way out, that I'm egotistical. Hopefully you will never feel the way I feel, but let me tell you something: dying is never easy, whether you have cancer or depression, the problem is you either get cured or you die trying. I chose the latest, because in this case, it is the easiest way out. 
I do not want to get better if it is to feel ten times worse later on. 

Also, dying is extremely difficult. The fear to leave everything you have always known, to leave all the people you love behind with an ache that will probably never leave. 

To not know if the method is going to work, to not know if there is Hell or Paradise after death. 

To know that the people that find me will be traumatised. To know that this might not work, that I might be in pain before eternal peace.

You do not know how it feels to live the way I do: to think about Death, research painless methods and in the end, to be too scared to do anything because you're too afraid to be in pain. I will never understand why euthanasia is not legal, as it will have saved me much of the troubles I encountered during this short lived journey, and also because I would have kept my dignity as a person. Death is not beautiful except to the eyes of the beholder. I wish I could leave without anyone finding me. I wish I could leave without anyone being in shock.

I love you and I'm sorry. But please do not feel sorry for me as I'm finally doing the thing I have always wanted to do. To rest in peace."
3474,Seriously considering finishing it tonight.,"They say ""it'll get better"" it never has, it's only gotten worse. I can't sleep or eat much anymore, today I upset my grandmother, it made me feel like such an asshole, I hate myself. My mom told me to grow a back bone and stop letting people walk all over me, which was kind of humiliating to me. One of my own friends called me a little bitch for being this way. I'm so tired, I just don't want to do this anymore."
3475,i wish i had a reason to keep going,"but i really don’t. everything keeps falling apart. it’s been proven to me that i’m forgettable and replaceable and that i don’t really matter in anyone’s life. my family doesn’t care, my friends are all going away, choosing other people over me, or hurting me. the only possible scrap at a better life is so far away from me. all i want to do is sleep all day so i don’t have to face the way i feel or what my life has become. i want to know what it feels like to be truly happy with your life and to love life, but i don’t think i’ll ever get to that point. i’ve already endured so much pain and i’ve had to bottle it up for so long that i don’t know if i can ever heal from it. i’m only seventeen but my life feels like it’s already over. i just want to feel human."
3476,ahhhhh I just wanna die,So I have so much anxiety about a dumb af math test tommorow there's no way I can learn all the material in time. If I fail the test I'll get a B. I just wanna go back like 2 years and fix everything. Everything feels wrong and I can't belive this is my life. I'm thinking about suicide but not super a er yet.
3477,"For those lost, looking for purpose, or wanting it all to end...","I'm not one to post much, here or anywhere. But I finally came upon a way to say something that has been in my mind for a long time.  First off, I am 37, recently realized I am transgender and was suicidal between 15 and 27 years old.  

There were 2 things that kept me from following through with killing myself, and I thought this might help someone somewhere.

1. I feel terrible.  Every day, every minute is emotional pain. Even when I display numbness, it's only because the emotional pain is so high.  What makes me think dying would end this? None of us know what dying is like. It might be that we can't change who or how we are once we die.  If I kill myself, i might just be in this miserable state forever.

2.  When relating to or seeing others who are depressed, I ALWAYS hope they pull through. I am always hoping they can defeat this shit and become something better than I am or can be. 

 How are they any better than me? In my perspective we are all equal, no one is better than me and I am not better than anyone else. If they are worth hoping for than I am worth it too.

 It took me a long time to come to this way of thinking. If any of you are needing to talk, I'm here, we are here. Post and people will listen."
3479,I don’t want to be alive,"I got traumatized from childhood/teenage abusive experiences. Every time I’m around people I get flashbacks, which makes it extremely difficult to hold down a job. I’m barely holding onto my job right now. My friends have left me. I’ve tried therapy and medication and it’s helped but I don’t know that I’ll be able to hold down a job or have meaningful relationships. I can barely get out of bed and feed myself with all this pain. There’s no point to being alive. I want to die."
3480,Not sure what to do,I need someone to talk to just a conversation I feel so lonely.
3481,it literally doesn’t fucking end,"i hate being alone but i’m so uninteresting that nobody can stand talking to me.

i’m not interested in anything anymore so i can’t talk about it.

nobody cares about me enough to check in.

it’s hard to cope when i can’t talk casually with people and distract myself but nobody wants to talk to me anyway. what the hell is there to talk about? even when i’m feeling okay i’m just into weird shit related to my studies.

i feel like i’m just empty. i’m missing something that everyone else has that draws people toward them. no one sees me. nobody even shows me pity.

i wish i weren’t so worthless.

i haven’t had a close friend in ten years. i feel so pathetic. i just want it to stop."
3482,How did you overcome the suicide of a loved one?,"My dad flew out to Spain just after his 65th birthday telling me he’s looking to buy an apartment and hung himself two weeks later. I don’t have much family, it was always just me and my dad. The other side of my family is very dysfunctional. I feel more alone than ever and have spent every day of the last 7 months depressed. I obviously have moment I enjoy but I’m on auto-pilot. The guilt of feeling you should have done more is difficult to deal with, too. My entire quarter century of life has been spent with my dad and barely anyone else so it’s hit really deep. I prepared myself for my dads death as he was approaching seventy but I never imagined this. He was a great man who deserved another twenty years of relaxing."
3483,Been thinking a lot about killing myself and its scaring me.,"Hey, to whoever's reading this. My fiancee left me two weeks ago. The love of my life, my soulmate, my entire world. She broke off our engagement and it's all my fault. I feel like I can never forgive myself for pushing her away from me. This pain hurts so fucking badly I just want it stop, oh please make it stop.The night she left I thought about killing myself but it was more to make the pain go away than anything.

Then this weekend came and I couldn't stop thinking about killing myself. How I'd do, the more I'd write, how much it would destroy my friends and family. I dont want to kill myself but I do want to die. I cant stop thinking about it and its really starting to worry me."
3484,my worries about the afterlife,"what if this is hell. i've been living in one constant severe dissociation episode for the past 4 years and i dont think any of this is real. life isn't real it's all just fake. what's the point in living if it's all a lie. i'm 17 and i've already had multiple suicide attempts but all failed because i'm too scared that if i fully commit and die, nothing will change. i feel that i already died. i'm miserable and alone and im giving up. i feel like we are living in hell because every day of mine is a nightmare and maybe that's why they say the good people die early because if there is a real life or a heaven, that's where they go."
3485,Fuck my life,"Over the past two years my mom has gonna through two bipolar manias, one last year and now she is going into another. She becomes very violent and frankly insane. She'll even get to the point of telling me she wishes I was dead if aggravated enough. I need to constantly walk on eggshells because even the slightest thing such as an empty water bottle on a counter will set her off, and cause her to immediately flip on me. She says she doesn't know why I'm her target or such a trigger for her but she's ""sorry"". I fucking hate my life. Somehow I still managed to graduate highschool but I had to do it online last year for my senior year because I was too socially anxious and depressed to even leave the house, and thoseproblems are still affecting me today. I listened to juice wrld in specific to get through the hard times. He's now gone. I don't know what to do. I wish I was dead. I don't know if I have the balls to kill myself but to be honest I don't see a point in living anymore. I just want it to end."
3486,i dont know what to do,"im so tired of waking up

im so tired of the world

im so tired of listening and doing, i just want to stay in bed every single day

im so tired of being strong and fighting on for some vague future

im so fucking tired of myself, im tired of looking at myself in the mirror

i literally just want to die, is that too much to ask?

ive tried so many times but im still here

every time i reach out people make me out to be a burden

ive been bullied and publicly shamed by people for just trying to reach out

i want to just fucking die already

i just want to get to the point where im so down ill start rotting 

i hate being alive so bad, i dont know what to do

please just make it all end"
3487,I feel like I’m drowning every day and I’m at a breaking point.,"Hi. I just really need a place to get this out because the people I have in my life are unavailable and the people that are available, I don’t want to be honest with. Every day I feel like I’m losing my grip on everything. I have a lot of responsibilities and a lot of people depend on me. At one point being of service to others was what I lived for, and it gave me purpose. There seems to be a new problem, a new issue or a new challenge every. single. day. I am exhausted. My cup is empty and other people still want me to fill theirs. I have been looking at a lot of things, like the process of creating a will, and making things for people. I’ve been looking at the best ways to die. I feel so lonely, but I am far from alone. My biggest issue is that I know it would destroy my parents and friends. I always said I would end it after my dad died since he doesn’t deserve to feel that hurt, but I feel like I’m suffocating and I don’t think I can wait. I’m taking a vacation in January to a place I love and I’m really considering ending it there, as far away as I can personally get from my family and friends. I am terrified of the unknown, and what is on the “other side.” I get sad thinking about all of the potential things I would miss out on. But I also have been dealing with this depression for too long and I’m more terrified that THIS IS MY FUCKING LIFE. Like for fucking ever. I don’t know what I will or want to do. I just needed to get it out because I feel like I can’t breathe."
3488,strong urges,"I’m not sure what to do or who to turn to. 

I’ve been fighting with my partner and am scared to tell them of my feelings and my intent. I don’t want to scare them or - worse - have them think I’m acting selfishly by contemplating suicide in light of our arguments. 

I have not been taking my venlafaxine, partly due to my bad habits (I always forget to take meds), partly because I really don’t like the side effects. 

I have a doctors appointment tomorrow to discuss my meds and seek psychiatric care, but honestly I’m just done. I’m over it. I want out. I want out."
3489,i think i'll do it tonight,i'm giving up i can't do this anymore
3490,I'm back at the bottom,"I've been feeling depressed and suicidal for some time now, but this past week things have gotten better. I started to get hope again...

But its back to fucked now... The hope I had is all gone and i'm lost... Idk what to do... I read something that suits perfectly how i feel: ""i don't want to die, i just want my life as it is right now to end""

Nothing makes me happy. The thing that helped me is gone and I just want to bury myself somewhere where noone will find me and cease to exist..."
3491,I hope you get the help you need,"Whoever out there is reading this, I hope you achieve greatness. This might be one of my final posts unless I survive. I hope you well in life. I'm sick of everyday being alone and I can't live like this. I hope all out there have someone and if you don't I'm here. These might be my final days, I don't know but anyway have a good life whoever you are."
3492,Haha,"I've  been suicidal for quite sometime.. I'm only 22..  I made my self Overdose on heroin once...  but by my mistake I should of waited until everyone left, so no one could of saved me..  but ever sense then I decided I really don't care if I either live, or die...  I shoot up meth heavily, but it seems like anymore i don't feel the high because my tolerance got so high,   I almost died last year,  do to unknown reasons because I wouldn't go to the ho hospital. I couldn't get out of a bed for a month.  My tongue and skin even started to turn blueish color. And even was coughing up blood. Suprised I even got better.    I Guess THE Point Of This Is,  I've been taking my body to its limits until I die of heart failure, kidney failure, cancer.. Ect.     I just don't have the energy to even care, I feel heavy, and just surrounded by darkness, and have felt that way since I was in elementary school..  on the bright side of things, I love to make nooses! They're my favorite necklaces."
3493,I just lost the last person from I childhood I thought loved me,"Caroll Spinney just died, I have never hurt this much, I never had anyone in my childhood I actually though loved me aside from the people on TV, and now they're all gone, Snuffy, Big bird, Oscar, Mr Rodgers, all gone, they all died, no one I knew growing up didn't either beat, molest, scream at, or cause me as much pain as is physically possible. I had no one to look up too, my house was always a powder keg, but the people on TV loved me, they knew me, the last one alive I can't even type the name out too because of how horribly bullied I was for liking the show she was in.   


Right now, I want to set myself on fire, I want to douse myself in gasoline and set it alight, I know how badly it hurts to be burnt, But that pain doesn't even begin to compare to what I feel right now, I am hollow, I feel like a tree that's nothing but bark, I can't even take the drugs I have all around me because I have to write up a fuck ton of shit all night, I just want to go away, I slept nearly all day today before I even knew what happened.  


During one of my dreams before i knew Caroll died was catching a bird in my window, and letting it in my dorm room, and becoming friends with it, I showed it everything I liked, and it seemed to understand and care too, then I had to let it go because pets aren't allowed in the dorm halls, It didn't fly away, it walked, It looked back, turned into something that I can't remember, then walked into the long grass.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be here, I had nothing as a child, I had no one, now they're all gone."
3494,This is it....what have i become,"I was the kid that was always happy.
I was the kid that had great fantasys and I couldnt await what the future holds for me.I was always happy had lots of friends and couldnt understand why people would be sad and depressive or would even kill themselves.
Now I am here ....17 years of age alone,broken and on the verge of killing myself...."
3495,The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because I’m scared of pain,"I’ve never been scared of the idea of dying. My memory fading into obscurity and eventually being forgotten has never bothered me, the fact that there might be nothing after life or that I might go to hell never bothered me, I never even cared about traumatizing my little sister and my parents. The only thing I’m scared of is the act of dying itself. I’m terrified of how painful it might be to end it myself. The thought of my heart slowly stopping as I suffocate and how much that may or may not hurt has been the only thing keeping me alive. I’ve heard people say that shooting your self in the head is “painless” but I’m to scared to try that since one of my friends described being shot in the leg to me as the worst pain he has ever experienced. I wish I could just be Thanos snapped out of existence and peacefully turn to dust. Sorry this is so long and doesn’t make nuch fucking sense."
3496,Juice Wrld,"I feel like his music helped a lot of suicidal and depressed people and now that he is dead more people will be affected by his death just like they were affected by xxxtentacion’s death.

But even when we feel like shit and feel lost we all got to remember.

Keep going, dont look back, and dont stop.
Live your life the way you always wanted to, fuck anybody judging, fuck anybody putting you down, and fuck anybody that makes you feel inferior or as if youre not important.

Pull yourself tf out of that hell and just keep going. Climb out of there inch by inch, eventually you will be free but just remember we are all climbing out of our own personal hells.

Even when it looks impossible just look forward and never look back.

RIP Juice Wrld and anybody else that lost their lives today ❤️ life goes on but we never forget"
3497,"Lately I've been wanting to see Jesus, and I don't know if it's seasonal affective disorder or too much alcohol or just a bad mood...","So I have schizoaffective disorder which mostly manifests as depression but also occasionally as hypomania or paranoia. I've been suicidal ever since I was a small child; I guess I just realized at a young age how pointless life is. I've attempted suicide literally hundreds of times over the course of my life and have yet to succeed; as I said in another post maybe I'm in hell already. The past week or two has been a nightmare; just constant arguments with my wife, I keep thinking she wants a divorce but she always denies it and pins the blame on me. It's reached the point though where maybe she will stop denying it... And I just want my Jesus! I almost swallowed some pills last night, and I've been following this doomsday preacher on YouTube because I want my Jesus so bad! A life of pure joy, with no pain or suffering! Why won't my Jesus take me?! Am I not good enough for him? What does he want from me before I'll be good enough? I guess a lot because my mother in law has been crippled for the past four years and Jesus doesn't want her either... I honestly think hell would be an improvement on the life i've been living! As for the SAD I mentioned, I haven't actually been diagnosed but I know my depression does tend to get worse around the holidays, and I did buy a mood light; it's not helping. The alcohol? I don't drink a lot but I will have a beer when I want to relax or just forget my worries, maybe twice a week or so. Probably not a good idea with my meds but screw it, I need to relax! What can I do? My wife wants me to get help but I don't have time or money for a counselor, maybe I can find some sort of online support group such as this subreddit..."
3498,I’m so close and I’m scared,"I’ve been suffering from depression since my early teens. It’s spiraled into an unbearable mess. Now that I’m in university, I have made no friends or connections because of this mental illness. Most of the people I was friends with before have forgotten about me, and I live alone. No one has a clue about what I’m going through. I just want to be gone already. I’m so upset that I failed at this life so bad that this has to end up as the conclusion. This is my last cry for help, I guess. I’m sorry to everybody I’m gonna let down."
3499,I tried to kill myself,"I was there, it was almost done but i exited. I'm useless. Not even suicide I can do right. My mom caught me and starts to call to all my family. In a few minutes my house was crowded with relatives, friends and other ones. The worst part is, I'm not sorry..."
3500,Can u overdose on melatonin?,"I took 20 about 35 minutes ago, can you actually overdose on 20 or do you need an higher amount?."
3501,What if I'm already in hell?,That's why my life is so miserable and I can never succeed in killing myself. And the little bit of joy there is in my life is put there to make the suffering all the more painful...
3502,Is an overdose of iron supplements painful,I have 30 tablets of 45mg slow release iron. If I eat the whole bottle will I die and if so will it be painful?
3503,I've wasted every opportunity in my life,"Just that, sorry."
3504,I’m really sick of life. I’m only 13 but I just don’t see a point anymore I feel like I’ll never fit in and I’ll probably never have any real friends,
3505,Decided how I'm going to do it,"I've figured out a time and a place. I'm gonna jump off a cliff and run away from all the pain. I've started to practice by standing on my bed and falling, imagining i keep falling."
3506,I feel like I've wasted every oprtunkti I'll ever have in my life,"Just that, sorry."
3507,I want to end it at the end of the year,"I've been suicidal for 3 years and I have always been ""open"" about it to my close friends. A bit over a week ago I told one of my new closest and now she has told her mum and the mum is going to tell the school. I never meant to put stress and pressure on her but now I don't know what to do. Does anyone have an idea on what to do?"
3508,I want to kill myself,Can I escape this feeling I don’t want to die but I want to die and I’m probably going to die
3509,I always get frustrated when I can't help a friend in need!,"Let me clear the whole story for you. I have a lot of friends from other countries far away from me and most of them are sad and depressed! I had depression and I'm easily influenced by other people emotions. Sometimes, seeing others background makes me thing about killing myself and how can I be so worthless and do nothing. I feel bad because there is nothing I can do to comfort them irl. sometimes they send me photos of them crying and I just want to die or hug them but I can't and then there is only one option left, thinking about death. I really care about those people and I keep pushing me into these relationship situations although I know what is going to happen (it makes me so sad that I wish I was dead because there is nothing I can do about it). It's probably impossible for someone to read this whole thing but if u did, thanks, u are a nice person."
3510,I think I am done,"This is really hard to write. I have fought off suicidal ideation most of my life and spent years in therapy unlearning the shit I grew up with being raised by a narcissistic mother. I was pretty healthy for a good part of the last few years, but got into a slow building abusive relationship in 2016 that only lasted a year but just changed everything. The end of it was financial ruin for me. Lost my apartment in the same week my transmission went out and my savings had been depleted a month prior when I got a surprise $550 heating bill on top of a $900 car repair. I was a single mom working as a waitress and moonlighting as a tax office clerk. My partner completely destroyed my reputation before I ever knew things were coming to an end, and then he destroyed my stability by pulling out right after my car shit out and never paying the rent for the month prior or that last one. It was shit timing for me. I couldn’t scrape together enough to avoid eviction but was still walking to work and bumming rides to try. Without a car I was unable to get kiddo to school and childcare so asked her dad for help which he agreed to only if she was living with him. He had battled me for custody once before and was denied as he was very controlling and alienating towards me as a parent. He was pretty giddy to have the upper hand and I was in a stuck spot where I had to bite my tongue and let it happen.  

A few weeks into summer it was clear I couldn’t catch up with my job and was trying to find a second one without having transportation. It wasn’t going well. He filed for an emergency change of custody at that time. As I had just been served eviction papers and had no immediate place to go that would provide my kid the same standard of living he could, it was granted. So in a few weeks time I lost my apartment, car, significant other and child. I’d been clawing my way out of poverty for years and had finally gotten somewhere and within months it all crumbled. I was fucking devastated and it took every ounce of fighting I had to get through. A friend who lived in a city an hour north offered me a room and use of a spare car to help me get stabilized. 

I didn’t have any other options that were viable and my restaurant agreed to the transfer. After a month of deliberations about what kind of human it would make me to leave my child behind or if I could find some other way, I realized I did not have any other options. I sold every single thing I owned, packed my clothes and pictures, and moved. Within a week I had begun work again, started a second job as well and was trying hard to keep my feet forward. I drove back twice a week to see my daughter between jobs, talked to her almost every night. Eventually my roommate helped me get an interview at her company and I was offered the position - $16/hr, full benefits. I was torn on taking it because the move was supposed to be temporary but eventually figured it would be a door that might never open again as I had never finished college after the kiddo was born. Fast forward to now, about 21 months later.

I have been promoted, am working a second job still, bought a car and have savings. I started medication a few months ago that has genuinely helped me feel normal instead of massively depressed for the first time since this all started. However, I haven’t seen my daughter in months or spoken to her in weeks. Her father started being more and more controlling and refusing visits, putting apps on her phone to monitor our calls and badmouthing me to her. At first she told me these things, but eventually she stopped responding to me altogether. So has he and has told me multiple times if I don’t like how he does things take him to court. I have been saving for a lawyer but the cost and logistics of the whole situation are still out of reach. I applied for legal aid but they told me they can’t take my case as they are overloaded. He makes three times what I do and has hefty inheritance money as both parents passed away the last two years. He knows he has the upper hand and is using it to destroy my relationship with my kid. 

It’s the holidays, and I am completely shut out from my baby. It’s awful. I’m dead inside. I have no contact with my mother and haven’t for years. She is a diagnosed borderline and her abuse is really bad - my brother has also cut her off and moved out of state to get away. My father was not in my life until I was 20, and lives 2000 miles away. We have a cordial but strained relationship and he is very Vulcan. Not supportive really, not warm. So I have spent all holidays as an adult without family. I’m 34 now. It’s been rough, but often I tag along with a friend or something. That’s slowed down now as most friends have their own families now. So this year I am 100% alone and it’s been destroying me.

On top of it, I have health insurance but have amassed almost 30k in medical debt this year from various scary things. I’m so in debt and feel fucking helpless about it. My student loans no longer qualify for deferment or repayment plans because I no longer have a dependent. So I have financial obligations out my ears that I can manage with two jobs, but it robs me of any mobility or chance to save any more for legal fees or just emergencies. I’m not living in desperate poverty anymore but I still work 70 hour weeks just to get everything paid and it’s killing me.

Lastly, I had a very close friend here who had also moved from our hometown. He had started at my job end of last summer and we immediately hit it off when spending time together. In all the chaos and alienating things I was going through, he was a joy and respite. We helped each other through multiple car issues last winter and were always together in free time. He became my best friend rapidly and eventually I had deep feelings I cane clean about. We had always slept together and spent nights together and were very coupley, but my confession seemed to change something. Over the past few months things have gone from blissful best friend I could do anything with and trust with my life to a severely abusive relationship that has just...drained me of all hope. He has abandoned me in serious situations a few times, lied to and deceived me regarding sex, said horrid things that have cut right through my heart and all but shunned me from his life when I started protesting and fighting back. 

This week I was in the ER for eight hours for more medical bs. Alone, terrified, already struggling and feeling isolated as hell. They prescribed me opiates for my pain and for the first time ever I actually filled them. I could barely walk and had to work double shifts all week. I had to get relief. But he was very mean to me the night I got out of the hospital. Offered no empathy or support, and when U broke down crying he told me to shut the fuck up several times and hung up on me. I was in so much pain that night I puked from it and ge was treating me horridly when I really just wanted someone to hold me. 

I kinda snapped inside a couple days later. Started writing letters to people I love telling them so, expressing favorite memories and telling them it wasn’t their fault. I’d decided to not take any more pain pills and I planned to take them all with a shitload of alcohol next Thursday. That would be the day after a new girl started at my day job who could assume my duties and after my schedule for the second job was completed for the week. I didn’t want to screw anyone over. I broke down hard that night and told one person, and they immediately told my best friend. 

He got angry at me and said he didn’t have time for my bullshit drama this weekend. Said he was busy cleaning his house for family coming next week. Then went out drinking. Told me I was stupid and selfish for considering suicide. Just treated me like a nuisance. But that he cared and wanted to help but someone else would have to because he couldn’t. 

Being treated like a worthless burden when I was already feeling like one drove me to tears and I decided I couldn’t take any of this anymore. I skipped work, started drinking, took a couple pills. Texted a couple people wanting to talk but then felt super guilty about taking up their time with my bullshit. He called to check on me once and I told him I was fucked up and trying to kill myself. He demanded I say where I was but I didn’t want cops or ambulances to come so I wouldn’t tell him. He hung up on me saying he had to pee and would call right back. I waited for that call for over an hour and once I realized it wasn’t coming I just broke down and started drinking more. I told him don’t worry about calling back I was gonna turn my phone off. My texts were almost indecipherable at that point and I was messed up. He called right away and said sorry it took so long he was getting another drink and had a cigarette. Then got mad at me and told me not to do anythin crazy and hung up on me again.

I passed out shortly after and didn’t wake up for almost 16 hours. I feel horrid right now. I have a few texts from friends asking where I am and can’t bring myself to respond to anyone. I don’t want to be rescued. My situation is bleak even on the most optimistic day. I just want out. I want away from this toxic best friend who has treated me like dirt for months. I want away from tens of thousands in debt I cannot pay. I want away from the deep loneliness and alienation I feel daily. I am so tired. Life without family is hard but I have tried to make the best of it my entire adulthood. I have taken the right steps for self care - therapy, meds, etc. and none of it means anything to m.

I drove behind a car with a Christmas tree on the roof today and pulled over balling. I just want somewhere to belong. I just want to feel like I have a family, traditions, things to look forward to. I have lost so much. I have fought super hard to make that a motivator to not give up but I am giving up.

I never finished my pills last night. I have enough left to do the job if I drink a fair bit first. I’m scared and feel ashamed for giving in but I have no respite in my life and all I have experienced lately is betrayal, being discarded and exhausted and seeing how little value I bring to anyone. My parents and daughter get along perfectly fine without me and my best friend has turned into a monster who makes it known he is also happier without me. I am not loved, or wanted or missed. 

I just wanted to put it down somewhere. I don’t want to be located or talked out of it. I just wanted the peace of knowing I explained myself first because I am not crazy or stupid. I’m just nothing."
3511,I’m always tired.,
3512,Need a quick way to kill myself not too painful.,"It’s also gotta be quiet and used outdoors. 

I’d rather have my family believe I was murdered  which is beyond their control rather than having them discover me hanging in my room"
3513,I know most people will do the opposite but please give my motivation to kill myself,My entire life has been awful and no one around me supports me
3514,i need immediate help to save my friend's life,"i dont have time for games i need immediate help
im so useless and i cant i cant i dont know how to help im sorry i i dont knowwhat icsndo

my girlfriend is sitting on her bed with pills in her hand, and says she can't put them away, she says she physically cannot put them away,, and if i even slightly mention something about calling her parents or the police, she yells at me and tells me not to or she'll never talk to me again,,, i dont know what to do i i i cant lose her bur im scared she might actually kill herself, i told her i wouldnt tell anybody unless she was an immediate threat to her life, she doesnt want to go bsck to  amentla hospitall, but i i cant i dont know what to do,

should i call the police or her parents and tell them she needs immediate help
or
keep trying to talk to her and give her all of the love and compassion i can and try to talk her out of it"
3515,Do people actually call the suicide prevention hotline?,
3516,Why should I not kill myself in an awesome way?,"So this isn't the typical post here. I don't know whats wrong with me and I'm not the 'usual' person to have feelings like this.

My name is Sam. I'm 22, 6'6 and reasonably well built. I compete in power-lifting regionally and nationally and have plans to go international within the next 2 years. I've been best friends with the same person for years and have a somewhat close knit group of friends that is slowly being divided by not wanting to smoke weed all the time. I go to University for Maths and I'm finishing up this year. I want to take it on to Masters and eventually a PhD but I'm not sure if I'm smart enough for that. 

I tried to talk to my Mum about these feelings I'm having and she just replied ""Oh don't be so silly, you've got no reason to feel like that, you've got it much better than I did."" and dismissed the conversation there. I spoke to my best friend about it who just called me a puff and then dismissed it as well. I even went to my coach for help who just told me I have more important things to focus on. After all of that had happened I went to a Doctor who wouldn't refer me to anyone as I don't fit the bill, part of me genuinely thinks I'm just going manically insane. As teen-angsty as this will sound I want to set everything on fire and just watch as I know I'm going to burn soon too.

Nothing is bad. Absolutely nothing. I love every part of my life but I just don't want to continue. You ever play a game that you're so into but all of a sudden lose interest and can't bring yourself to play? Its like that. I wouldn't even consider myself depressed, its as if I'm self aware of these feelings but still can't help myself. I just don't see a point. I have goals and dreams but I don't care if they come true or not. I don't know whats wrong with me. Why shouldn't I just throw myself off of a huge building and feel pure adrenaline and euphoria for those few seconds? It won't affect me 20 seconds after jumping anyway. My family and friends may be sad but I'll be gone, but I won't know that. Maybe they'll be happy in some weird way. My drive to continue in life is slowly being whittled down, I can see it happening in front of me and know I should do something but I don't know what to do. I know I'm not the 'normal' type of post you'd see here but I don't know where else to go or what else to do. Can someone please help me."
3517,I’m done,I used chegg on a take home test. I will probably be expelled. My life is over.
3518,Nothing works anymore,"I am trying. I am trying so hard. A hundred fun days couldn’t keep me happy. Everything is boring, everyone is boring, life is boring. I had a great day today. And yesterday. And the day before. But I have cried myself to sleep EVERY night in the past week. It’s not me. It’s the thoughts in my head that ruin everything for no reason. They’re all just, “you’re an awful person” and “your boyfriend doesn’t love you” and “life is pointless so you should just die” type shit. I don’t think it’s me bringing this upon myself anymore. I just do absolutely nothing and they come flooding, and then I cry and feel so so sad. Not empty. My heart just feels so heavy, as if I’ve lost everything in my life. Maybe I have. I’ve lost the motivation and the enjoyment of the little things. Watching the snow fall used to make me feel so relaxed. Now it just feels like looking back upon old, sad memories. 

I don’t think these things about myself. I actually have a fair amount of confidence, and I like my fashion taste, and I still enjoy keeping my hygiene and such. I think I’m very pretty. I think I’m funny, and kind, and that maybe I deserve a little bit better. But these thoughts treat me like I’m a pile of shit and they come out of nowhere and ruin everything. And fuck, they’re convincing. I just don’t know what to do. I am trying so hard. I haven’t given up, but what is there to do anymore? My life is all just overthinking. 

The worst part is that my boyfriend used to make me so happy. Him sending me a cute text could make my day, instantly. I guess I’d kind of say he’s the last thing keeping me alive. (I know, dependent. I’m sorry.) But he can’t make my day anymore.

Nothing makes me happy anymore."
3519,"If I can't handle school rn, I definitely ain't gonna handle work when I'm out of school.",
3520,"For the first time, I’m contemplating ending things.","I’m alone, not good enough to maintain a relationship, and people I’m always interested in never reciprocate.  I have shitty social skills.  It’s hard for me to keep long conversations going.  I feel apathetic towards everything.  Only thing going for me is having my own job and place, and some friends, but I feel like I’m losing interest in my current group of friends. 

 I’ve had recent issues at work that left an awful taste in my mouth and have been discouraging me from wanting to continue working there (I’m a teacher).  I no longer trust anyone and always get the feeling that people are out to get rid of me in the profession.  I’m also afraid that it’s too late to try to change career paths (im in my 30s) and I’d be perceived as a fool for giving up the health and financial benefits that would be good in the long run.  I’ve been on a medication for years for anxiety/depression and this last month or so has just been keeping me down.  

I’m just losing interest in everything.  People my age are getting married, having kids, and enjoying life being single can only go so far.  I have family, but they just want me to continue seeing therapy.  They (My parents) expect me to toughen it up.  A close relative of mine is getting married in a few months and I know I need to be there for that, but after that I’m honestly not sure what else I have to live for.   A lot of this is likely situational and I’m going to have to think about a lot of things.  

But this is the first time I’ve really contemplated suicide, and I feel like an ass for doing so.  I don’t know what else to say/do except write this and see what happens and how things go overtime.  I know things can be worse, but my mental health prevents me from wanting to be happier."

3522,Im so close to doing it,I'm so close to just throwing my life away. Nothing good is going to happen to be if I keep living. My ex dumped me at literally the worst time. I just want to be happy. Why can't i just be happy?
3523,Need help,Trying to figure what I can do to help my wife get over my suicide. I have 3 months to get it right and really want to limit her suffering as much as possible. And me staying behind is not an option
3524,after my ex girlfriend broke up with me it all started going downhill,"my girlfriend broke up with me 3 months ago today, it still breaks my heart. I’ve tried everything praying, counselling talking to my friends and all I hear is the same bullshit that it’s going to get better... WHEN when will it get better it’s not going to. I’ve tried to find my way out before and it’s only a matter of time before I try again, and honestly I can’t wait till I do and fingers crossed it’s gonna work and I’ll never wake up."
3525,It's all the same,"I used to post on this sub 3 years ago and since then I've tried commiting suicide by downing pills and putting a bag over my head, I woke up later in ER. Life hasn't improved one bit since, it's only gotten worse. I would analogize my life by saying I was thrown off a mountain at birth and that I have been rolling down it endlessly hoping to one day finally reach the bottom.

I've been searching everywhere, I wanted to find insight and wisdom on how to live life and feel fullfilled when you're in a position such as I, but have never found an answer. For years I've spent trying to come to terms with depression, anxiety, stress and the fact that I will never have any social relationships outside of job acquaintances, if I ever manage to find a job that is.

I've learned a lot though, I feel more in touch with myself and the world than I could have ever imagined. Everything aside from my thoughts and feelings seem trivial to me, nothing else bothers me. I don't ever get upset at anyone, I couldn't care less what anyone thinks of me, or what happens to me or this world. I feel transcendent, I had a spiritual awakening of sorts and ever since then my perspective on the world has changed immensely.

I'm 20, I've called out for help for a long time now, but the fact that I'm still alone and confused after almost a decade reinforces the idea that truly no one cares and they never will. I make this post as a last ditch effort to try and find an answer, if not, I will bid farewell a second time and hope that I don't come back this time around."
3526,I'm done,"Everything has fallen apart and it's entirely my fault.

I hate myself and I hate being alive"
3527,Hypocritical,"  I came to this subreddit because I don't feel... well.
I don't know what my problem is. I'm 16, I have a few solid friends, some not so solid that I still care about. I have a decent family and they have middle class money soni usually get things that I want. I have nothing to be sad about. Except one thing. I want to be loved. Not platonically, friendship or family love. I want to have real love. And I've wanted it for as long as I can remember. When I was 15, at the end of my freshman year of highschool, I met a girl in theater. She was 18 about to graduate. Over summer we got closer and we started dating. She was my first everything. That lasted 11 months, and then she left. The night she left I almost killed myself. My many attempts to get her back have only pissed her off and gotten many instagram accounts blocked. She's with her ex who doesnt care about her even though she told me she doesnt get back with exes and believes I never cared about her. I tried finding someone else and it never happened. I tried making more friends at school but nothing happened. I made a tinder account and pretended to be 18, nothing happened. Well nothing good. And nothing else I do makes me happy. I cant even tell if I still miss her or not. I love her, but do I want her back? Maybe? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like my friends dont like me either. On nights like this one I linda just lay in bed and think about what people would do if I died. Would SHE cry? Would my friends attend my funeral? Would I even get a funeral? I came to this subreddit for some reason, I dont know. I just typed suicide into the search bar and found it. And when I looked at all these people, complaining, it angers me. They're all so dramatic. I hate it. The things they say make me angry in a way I dont understand. I'm no different. So why does looking at all these hopless people sitting around in a pool of disappointment and angst infuriate me so much? Just suck it up... right? No. That's not how it works. I know it's not because I'm the same. But it still pisses me off. I don't want to live anymore, but I dont want to be like these people. I want to die, but I dont want to pretend my problems actually matter enough to kill myself. But if they aren't then why is it always on my mind? I don't know what to do and I hate it. I dont even hand a moral or a conclusion to this post. I'm just... angry."
3528,I need help,I’m battling suicide ideation right now. I (17m) feel constantly inadequate from her narcissism and feel like I will never amount to anything. I need someone to talk to.
3529,The only way out,"Day by day suicide is becoming more and more of an option. I’ve always wanted to do it but kept putting things off as I thought things would get better. I always thought that when I go to uni I will be happier and I wasn’t. I thought that when I finally get a gf I would be happy and all my self hatred would fade but it hasn’t. I then thought that as soon as I have my first job I will be happy but I’m not. I’m more miserable than I’ve ever been. I’m a school teacher and do enjoy parts of my job but the paperwork and other tedious tasks means I have no time to myself and am constantly overworked. I’m also not hitting my Newley qualified teacher targets and am failing my first teaching year. I don’t see myself passing and don’t see things getting better. 

If I fail my teaching year I can’t teach again and I will have no future. I have a degree but I don’t feel like it will transfer to other lines of work well. I feel constantly overworked and like I am failing and suicide is starting to feel like the only way out.  The only reason I haven’t yet is I know it will effect my family. I roughly plan to go through with it after New Years which gives me some time with my family and friends to properly say goodbye and so they can hopefully get some closer."
3530,Just relying on one person.,"I live in California, specifically a part where white people are minorities. Typically I am the only white kid in the class. I often am chosen easily for getting comments like ""woah dont shoot up the school"". I have been talked to by teachers cause people see my not happy and assume I'm going to hurt them. 

Anyways, I kinda have a group of 'friends' but dont really talk or hangout with them. I go to school just to see one friend I actually like. I've told her that I really dont care about myself or my life, and i dont want to tell her that she is the reason I'm still alive. I tell her stuff I wouldn't tell others, things like how I wish I was like everyone else. I dont like having blue eyes and being white.

She always tells me that everyone would want what I have, my blue eyes and red hair are good.
I always tell her no.

Recently I've started seeing that after school and on weekends I just dont find anything fun. Nothing makes me happy. The things that I would actually like to do is just not fun. I sit at my desk and stare into nothing waiting for the next day to come. She knows I'm suicidal but frankly I dont think she really focuses on it. I cant sot by her without someone saying something on the lines of ""Oooh I see you (Dreaded Heart)"". The only thing keeping me from killing myself is her and I dont know if she even cares. Sometimes I think she would not like those comments and the only way to keep her from hearing comments like that would be for me to leave."
3531,I was always sick,"Now that I've read up on this, I think I always had visual snow, memory loss, light sensitivity and a slight tinnitus. Lately I've seen the symptoms grow stronger, they're not so easy to ignore. 

I don't wanna continue. 
I don't want to go with treatment again.
It makes me sad and potentially worsens the symptoms besides depression 

I don't want to burden my parents any more.

3532,I’m in danger,"I want to overdose. But I don’t want to die forever. Idk my depression is getting better but my suicide and self harm urges are getting stronger. I already overdosed but it wasn’t enough to kill me. I want to become very sick, I want to almost die. I have no idea why I feel like this but it’s getting harder and harder to stop myself. I’m not safe, but I don’t want to go to the psych ward (I’ve been before) idk what to do"
3533,Curiosity,"I am way to curious to say what afterlife is like. I’ve thought about ending it a lot lately. These thoughts have made me realize that depression has to be a mental illness because my life isn’t all to bad. I’m just sad a lot and can’t live up to set expectations. 

Anyone feel the same way?"
3534,Rights and laws,"Hey what are some rights involving mental health, especially involving the police? I had a bad experience and I just wanted to know what rights I had. I was not trying to commit suicide but someone else thought I was and the police got involved and it was very bad."

3537,im done,"i don’t see a purpose for myself anymore. no one cares about me and I don’t know why I haven’t just ended it yet. I almost did and I decided to give life one more chance and now I’m stuck. I don’t want to ruin the holidays for my family but I’m scared I am going to find hope again. If I do it will be temporary and only cause more pain. My brain doesn’t work properly, I need someone to rely on in order to function properly and feel okay and for some reason I’m vulnerable. I rely on people who only want to hurt me and I’m so hurt and traumatised that I literally can’t carry on."
3538,I can't take any more holidays or birthdays or weekends or weekdays alone,"I am not going to spend another day alone. I deserve to be with a loved one. I am worthy of love. 

If I can't have that, then I'm just ending it. I tried, I gave it time and I gave it every chance. Now I'm done."
3539,I've been suicidal for a while now but my gf of 5 hears and I just broke up and now I'm so lost,We both work the same job too and I've missed the last couple days. I'm worried that they may fire me which just compounds my fragile state of being right now. I know it's not healthy to rely so heavily on the presence of someone else but I truly saw myself spending the rest of my life with this person and I just want to disappear so badly right now.
3540,Not actually suicidal but things are weird.,I have random bursts of suicidal thoughts and was wondering how to prevent this? I dont plan on going through with any of these thoughts but things are off.
3541,I regret not letting myself die on Friday.,I was so fucking close. If I let the artery bleed for just a few more minutes I could’ve had relief from my pain. I regret not doing it now.
3542,Do hotlines help at all?,
3543,The afterlife,The afterlife a place you go once you die but it does scare me enough to now wanna die but also pushes me twords it there quantum immortality and straight up ceasing to exist it all terrifies me but I’m gonna die anyway so what’s the point of doing or questioning anything
3544,Why is everyone too scared to tell me to kill myself?,"I an stuck with not knowing if I should kill myself or not because everyone is too scared that they will be blamed if I do kill myself. I think suicide is the answer because I don't have much family and that cannot really be solved and I don't have a lot of money and I won't become rich unless I win the lottery, gain some inheritance, become famous, make some big investments, or start a business that makes a lot of money. I am not happy without money or family. 

Why doesnt someone use the posts in this subreddit to address the problems in this world and make it a better place?"
3545,Gonna die alone so why not,
3546,I want to do it but I’m too much of a coward thinking of the consequences.,I’ve been masking my unhappiness long enough. I have the possible means to but I’m afraid of waking up and dealing with the failure. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I started to research the potential ways I could do it and it’s always in the back of my mind. Now I might actually act on it.
3547,I do not love myself,"My afternoon has been filled with suicidal ideations yet again for the seventh and a half year in a row without fail I fantasize about finding that loaded gun in the gutter of the sidewalk and doing the deed... Things you like come and go. Whether it's of your doing or its. My hair is non-existent. I don't have any talents to draw on, but people say I'm an ok writer; I don't know what to do with that. I have a physical disability where I can't stand or sit longer than two hours at a time, like cyatica pretty much. Everything I do I need to switch positions I'm constantly distracted by my pain and I hate how I sound how I think just everything. Ihhhaaaaaaatemyyulifffeeiiccantwaittogetsleepyagain FF uckallofthisbullcrapiiiiiiiii8iiiii don't love I hate myself so much."
3548,I came this close in 2016 . . . .,"Stress . .  anxiety . ,. .  depression.  Any one of these is disastrous.  All three at one time is a death sentence.  And I came this close.

I'm 57 years old, married over 30 years with three kids in college and high school.

I started suffering severe anxiety in 2015, to the point I would shut the door to my office at work and just sit down, close my eyes and take deep breaths.

Then over a 10 week period at the end of 2015, both of my parents died.  

My dad was in a nursing home, suffering from head injuries and strokes which turned into dementia.  For the last 10 months he was vegetative, but someone told me that even though he wasn't moving or responding, he may be able to listen and process what he hears.  So I would sit next to him and talk to him, tell him what was going on with his grand kids, even try to tell jokes.  He passed away in September.

Then about 10 weeks later,  my mom died.  She was a chain smoker all her life and suffered from emphysema (or COPD, whatever).  She was in and out of hospitals for almost three years with various breathing and lung ailments.  Thanksgiving weekend she went in to the emergency room via ambulance, but she was able to recover to the point that they could send her to a rehab center, which she refused.  Instead she went home, even though she was not well at all.  I called her at 2:00 PM on a Saturday to ask her how she was doing and she sounded awful, the worst I had ever experienced.   But then when the call was over I went back to my daily routine.  She was dead 9 hour later.  I should have left my house and driven the 30 miles to see her, but I didn't and she died on the floor of her apartment, 12 days before Christmas.  The guilt is still with me four years later. I am in tears just typing this.

I never really grieved for either death.  My brothers and I didn't hold a wake or a funeral for either one, instead we had them both cremated.  And I only took off one day of work each time.  The dumbest thing I ever did.  I would start crying at work, often having to leave the room to find a private place to sob.

Then 2016 hit me like a ton of bricks. Work stress mostly, from an abusive, micro managing boss and the fear I would lose my job.  I make 95% of the income in my house, and my wife and three kids rely on me for their livelihood, the roof over their head, everything.  

I descended into a very dark place.  I would swing from stress and anxiety, constantly ruminating and anticipating disaster, to deep depression, feeling like I was worthless, a failure.  I went six months without sleeping more than 3 hours.  I lost 25 pounds, from 170 to 145 pounds (I'm about 5 foot 7 inches).  During this entire time, my wife never said a thing, never asked me what was wrong, never even putting her arm around me.  Nothing.

July was rock bottom.  Fourth of July was a glorious weekend weather wise, but I spent two days in my bedroom, with the drapes shut, lying in bed trying to sleep. I was exhausted but too stressed to sleep.  

I had enough.  The following weekend I decided that I was going to kill my self.  I decided that I would buy garden hose, pipe clamps and duct tape, drive to a remote area, connect the hose to my car exhaust and then run it into my car while I sat in the front seat.

Two things made me change my mind.

First was writing the suicide note to my family.  It was basically a love letter to my three kids, telling them how proud I was of them, how they would do great things in life, and asking them to forget about how much of a loser and miserable failure that I was.  When I was done, I was afraid for my kids, and I couldn't  imagine them without me there to be their father and provider.

**The second thing that happened still haunts me to this day.  I drove to the local Home Depot to get the  hose and stuff.  I drove into the parking lot, and when I opened the car door, there was a $20 bill lying on the ground, next to my car, right there where I couldn't miss it.  I picked it up and went into the store and used that $20 to buy the things I was going to use to kill myself.  I was so messed up that I didn't even question it at the time.  But I can't believe that it was a coincidence.  I truly believe it was Satan.  He thought he had me.**  

But Satan didn't get me.  And that weekend, as I thought about the parking lot experience and my kids, I tore up the suicide note and went on the road to recovery.

And I have mostly recovered.  I survived two stressful years at work, and just a month ago I got a big promotion.  Still suffering from stress, but I learned a lot about myself from my trials, and I am working on learning ways to cope.

What hasn't recovered is my relationship with my wife.  I was so upset she ignored my pain, and I have tried to re -establish a connection, but no luck.  Been married 30+ years, but right now I can honestly say I don't like her.  We have gone through many dry spells the past few years, and right now we have a dead bedroom, no sex for 14 months and not even intimacy.

There is a woman at work, a contractor, who I have been talking with over coffee.  She is my age, raised three kids as a single mom and appears happy.  I think about her more than my wife, she is really such an interesting lady, and I want to ask her out for a drink after work.  If things get beyond that, hey, it might be fun.  And would my wife be upset?? I really don't care.  I might actually tell her what I'm doing.

So that's where I am.  Alive, but wounded and recovering.  I'd say the story is being written, and the final chapters are still up in the air.

But my message to those in a similar situation.  Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  You'll find that there are people who have been through worse and survived, and when the stressful situation is over, you'll find out it wasn't as bad as you thought it was when you were neck deep in it.

I am glad to get this off my chest.  It's cathartic.  Thank you , Reddit, for providing a forum to post this."

The thoughts running through my head, the tears falling from my eyes, the void I feel within me. It feels like so much was just bottled up and I could just cry forever. All I could think about right now is a way out. I dug myself in a hole that doesn’t even make sense to me anymore. Why do I make the decisions I make? That’s all I want the answer to. What is wrong with me? I’ve had a pretty traumatic childhood and I’m realizing I was in need of help a long time ago; but it was never an option for my low income, uneducated parents. If only they expressed love to me as I was growing up, I think everything would be okay, because right now, at this very moment - all I want is to feel loved. But I have/had to deal with everything on my own - anxiety, depression, and now suicidal thoughts on top of all the other things wrong. Fuck, I’m starting to cry again. I can’t help but feel like I don’t deserve this. I think about my potential all the time if I was raised under different circumstances. I’m a smart, good-hearted person, and I love helping other people. I’ve been doing everything right for a couple months now, progressing and improving myself - but now, in my 21 years of living - I have never felt so low and alone. I’m not writing this for sympathy, and I definitely don’t need anyone’s pity. I just need the strength to make it through the next couple hours. Please help me. I’m so scared. There’s so much pain."

Went to grad school 2016-2018 and dug myself six figures in debt.

250 job rejections from 2018-now without an interview, I took a 10K paycut to go to work.

I can't afford to pay my bills even though I work 70-plus hours a week. I'll never own a home. I'll never raise a family. My own family has disowned me because I'm a failure. My friends have stopped talking to me because I'm worthless. 

I'm dragging my wife down too. She'll never have the life she wants either because I'm in it.

I've been shamed publicly, ostracized socially, and humiliated everywhere in between.

Medication and therapy don't do a fucking thing because my life sucks. I'm depressed because society has thrown me away.

Try to prove me wrong that my fucking death wouldn't be an upgrade for anyone stupid enough to close to me.

I'm a worthless fucking stain that needs to be removed.

I live on the 4th floor.

This will take seconds to end this lifetime of bullying, ridicule, destitution and pain.

3561,"I just want to end it, but I don't want my family to suffer.","Tl:dr I want to commit suicide, my life is falling apart but I'm afraid people around me will suffer from my decision.

I'm 25, some people might say I'm too young to suffer like this, and that probably I still have a lot more to live and experience. I don't want you to read this and think that my goal is to draw attention or receive motivational messages from you. I'm just here to share my story, which for some of you might be not that hard, but it surely had an impact on me, since i'm here asking for help and thinking of committing suicide. My life was kind of perfect until around 5 years ago; at that point things started to crumble.. my family and I discovered that my father cheated on my mum with other women and even had a son with one of them. He did some illegal shit and was sentenced to house arrest for one year; moreover, in order to pay the debts that he created, the bank decided to foreclose my mum's salary. This created lots of tensions in our house, my mother was forced to live with him because he didn't have enough money to find a place for himself and she had to pay his debts (and still has). Even if I understand that everything he did was wrong, I can't say he was a bad father to my sister and I, so it is really difficult to accept this reality. He was later diagnosed with larynx cancer and he fortunately made it through, even though he basically lost the ability to speak. Nonetheless, I was still hopeful for my family's future, I was studying at university, so I spent most of my time away from home, I was surrounded by friends and I had met the love of my life. Few months ago everything changed, once more: I finished my courses and was forced to get back home. My sister moved away, she is now living with her boyfriend and I'm happy that she doesn't have to experience this. Moreover, my girlfriend left me and most of my friends now have found their own girlfriends so I meet up with them rarely. Every day I wake up wanting to die, I want to leave but I don't have any money, I'm trying to focus on finishing my exams and graduate. My parents don't talk to each other and I am at home almost every single day, having to deal with all of these stupid issues that just make me want to cry all day. I don't want to die, I don't like the idea of it and I know for sure my family would suffer so much from it. But I just want everything to end, I feel lonely and I am ashamed to tell something so private to people I don't even know just to get emotional support."
3562,I ALWAYS FEEL THE WEIGHT OF MY FAILURE,does anyone else feel like everyone on earth is more successful than you and you’re constantly being left behind and you’re never going through the right phase of life at the right time and everyone else is ticking off boxes and building a life and you’re rotting and you ????
3563,I’m sorry,"My whole life I’ve been that screw up in the family or the kid no one wants to hangout with. I was used to being the friend you could replace after a couple of days of knowing him in class. I started giving up in life cause I knew there would always be someone better than e and I was ok with that. So I spent the last 3 years wanting to be happy, walking away from friend groups cause I knew I would be replaced with someone better. I know I won’t amount to anything in my life, and I know it’s not alright to be ok with that like i’am now. But I’m tired fighting, I’m tired of feeling sick in the head, waiting for someone to help me knowing there’s no one there to help. I’m not gonna doing anything rash, or hurt myself, but the thought always come back and the little voice is telling me I’m worthless. Recently I did find a friend group that hasn’t left me yet, and a friend hugged me. It was weird, I was never really hugged before, even the thought of it was weird. Having someone feel like they genuinely care for me was odd, I spent so much time fearing it because I hurt myself and someone else being happy. But that changed, now I can be happy no longer being afraid of the consequences of it, I wrote this to let you know there is actually hope for happiness. Sure a million people could tell you there own story of how they became happy like I did, but finding happiness is doing it yourself. No one knows how to make yourself happy except yourself, and it’s going to be hard. You’re gonna want to go back into a dark place but every moment you spend trying and fighting to be happy is a victory In the books."
3564,Things to do before my suicide,"So, you see, I had some friends and one person among them that I really really loved. I still do. But he doesn't love me back anymore, he doesn't want even to talk with me anymore... So all these friends don't want either. I have literally no one right now, even to talk to. Everybody fucking hates me, literally everybody. The way they threat me now, the way they're looking at me. They do hate me. And I hate myself the most. It's been few weeks since I lost everyone and everything is still so fucking painful. I surely don't wanna live anymore. I don't have a reason to. When I had friends we used to play computer games everyday, I was also drawing really often. These were the only things I enjoyed doing. But since these few weeks everyday looks the same. I cry for few hours, take sleeping pills, sleep for few hours, wake up, cry again and again and again, take sleeping pills. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Nothing at all. I'm not able to live anymore, so I'm just trying to sleep as often as I can. But even sleeping is painful - I have nightmares. Everyday. All these people are in them... They escaped from me but I'm the only one who can't escape from myself. I decided - I need to die. I already chose the perfect day. But I need to survive few another weeks then.

I have nothing and no one to lose anymore. I can do literally everything right now, because soon I won't be here after all. Do you have any ideas what I can do before killing myself?

I've thought about some trips, to the places I liked or wanted to visit before I lost all interest in everything. I'll do few piercings I've always wanted to have (I wonder if they can make me be able to look at myself in the mirror). If I'll have an occasion, I tell some people what I really think. But how about some unwonted things? Do you have any ideas? I don't care if it'll be something weird, creepy, dangerous, shaming or whatever, I don't care about anything, but I don't want to just die - I wanna start really living for a short while."
3565,I'm just done,"I always thought I'd have felt something big when this moment would have come, but I just don't feel anything.

I just shot another shot and failed again.
I ran out of ammo.

What I'm trying to say is that there's no way for me to get help. I could live just for others, but I will hurt the whole time.

I have finally understood there's no going back from the dark spot I pushed myself into.

I will make my decision soon.
I'll let you know."
3566,I don’t want this life,"My parents are a bit more permissive than others, and give me allowance and I can buy stuff I like and so. My friends sometimes say they get jealous of me bc their parents never give them money. I travel almost every year once, my friends say they would love to go there and travel too.

Welp, I’d gladly trade lives. I don’t want any of this. I just want to stay at home doing barely anything and thinking about how worthless I am instead of going on some trip and having an almost normal life that makes my parents go whenever the topic of me being suicidal comes out “I don’t understand why you feel that way, I thought you thought you had a good life”. I want an actual shitty life so at least I have the courage to actually kill myself or something"

3569,Popped all antidepressants from their casing and already ate some.,"I don't have anywhere else to turn to. Those closest to me pushed me away, so now I am here, with a bunch of pills and water. I wonder what would happen if I ate all of them at once. I wonder if they started caring once I died. People always care only after one dies anyway. I wonder, would they miss me?

My best friend now doesn't want to be my friend and I feel so awful I can't take it. I feel sick.

I don’t even know why I’m here. Just turning to the one place I know: Reddit. Sorry for any mistakes, my eyes are leaking. 

I know no one cares about any type of backstory or even me, but I guess I should give a bit more background to make myself seem a little less like the shitty teenager you’ll think I am. 

But first of all, what sparked this particular fight (if I can even call it that) was I was just having a generally shitty day. Felt nauseous all day for some reason, my mother drove over a curb which caused the pizza we had just bought to spill onto my brand new white shirt, plus my mom has just been rude all day, to me, to strangers. It’s just your typical annoying day. I was annoyed and you could tell. Wasn’t really speaking much, but when I did, I was short with her and bitter. This annoyed her and I knew that, but I couldn’t make myself cheery. Right before our “fight”, I was telling her about Juice WRLD and how sad it was. I had already mentioned his passing earlier, but I’m a big fan of someone he had collaborated with, didn’t know they had collaborated until that moment, and was explaining to her how they apparently collaborated. During saying this, she was nodding her head and acting like she was listening, but apparently she wasn’t. She started coughing a few moments after I was finished speaking and said, “I was choking the entire time you were talking! Thanks for noticing and caring. Really means a lot.” 

Now, if I had noticed she was choking, I would’ve immediately helped her. I’m not that horrible. When speaking to her, I was looking directly at her and she was nodding the entire time and didn’t seem in distress whatsoever. I was confused and told her this, but she said she was making it obvious but couldn’t tell me she was choking since she couldn’t breathe and was coughing. I pointed out she didn’t cough until after I finished speaking, but she just said I was wrong. I let it go, because I don’t want to argue, so I just go back to browsing Reddit. She asked me, “now, what did you say?” and I just told her to forget about it, it didn’t matter. This is where everything went horribly. She persisted, “come on, tell me. Now.” I’ll admit, I yelled at her. Everything was boiling right under the surface and I just couldn’t keep calm anymore. She proceeds to tell me she heard me mention Juice WRLD and my favorite band, but she didn’t know why. I told her then she must’ve heard me. 

This is when she decides to push my buttons. She starts saying how I’m just “the happiest little girl she’s ever met” (I’m almost 19), how I’m a ray of sunshine and SUCH a good daughter and she’s laughing this entire time. I’m ignoring her because she does this all the time, looking for a reaction and I don’t want to give her the satisfaction. This is when she mentions how I need “happy pills” and she doesn’t know what type of pills that would be, but I need some kind of pill. (she didn’t mean antidepressants) This seemed incredibly insensitive to me as I was just speaking to her about Juice WRLD and of course, so many people are thinking his death is caused from drug use. She knew what she was doing. I’ll admit, I said something really disgusting. I said “good, maybe they’ll kill me so I can finally die.” 

She’s known about my suicidal thoughts since August of this year and didn’t much care when she found out. She actually found out because I had told my sister about some notes/journal type things I had written to help me cope. She confronted me like I was in trouble, saying “we need to talk and you know exactly what you’ve done.” She didn’t do anything except threaten me with making me go to a hospital and sent me to my room. I’ve brought it up one other time, on Thanksgiving after a huge family fight, saying May 2018 I had a handful of pills ready to go and didn’t do it. She made this about herself, saying how she must be a terrible mother. I just ignore it at this point. 

After I said maybe the nonexistent “happy pills” she’s speaking about would kill me, she started going off. She said I have no business acting like my life is so horrible, how I have the easiest life in the world, how other people my age have school, jobs and even kids and how she doesn’t make me do anything and hands me everything on a silver platter. I’ll get to why this really hurt me later. But she just kept saying that I shouldn’t act like she’s the worst person in the world because she’s “the best mom I’ve got.” (she says this every single time me or my sibling is upset with her) and I stayed silent the entire time. I was crying, but silent. She knows why I struggle with living, but doesn’t care. She dropped me off at our shared home and left. She has actually came back home as I was writing this, I’m currently locked in a bathroom. 


A big reason as to why I struggle with living is because of chronic illness. For probably 8 years, I’ve been sick. I genuinely don’t remember what it feels like to not feel pain. It started with a rare condition which was causing me to vomit every day of my 12 year old life and I started to lose my vision. Took a year before they figured out what it was, but i was on medication for a long time + spinal taps every couple months before I finally had brain surgery in 2015. A few months after the surgery, I had a fever every single day of August. It took a while before they discovered what it was: IBD. Not many people without IBD know how much it sucks and I’m sure my experience is unlike other people suffering with IBD, but when I say my IBD has ruined my life, I mean it. I haven’t been in remission once since fall 2015. I’ve been close, but there has always been something wrong. My GI office that I stuck with from beginning to summer of this year also didn’t help much, as I found out I had been on medication I shouldn’t have been (steroids for 3 years) which has also made my life a living hell. I have since been diagnosed with cushing’s syndrome because of the steroid use. I also have fibromyalgia, osteopenia and gastroparesis. 

Things were bad May 2018, since I had that handful of pills, but that summer I was started on chemotherapy and it genuinely ruined my life. 
I don’t know if my reaction was normal, but after a couple doses, my days started blending together. It’s hard to describe, but it felt like my average day was maybe an hour or two long. During this time I felt absolutely zero emotion. I felt nothing. I just remember wishing I could feel again. Crying and being upset hurts, but being physically unable to feel nothing, being completely and utterly numb, is so much worse. I really could not feel. And I thought it would get better after I was off of it, but I didn’t, for a long time, I was so numb and so scared. I’m still not back to what I was before. 

The only way I can describe how I feel is like I’m in this super deep dark hole, I’m completely alone, it’s freezing cold and all my senses have been ripped from me. All I feel is so scared. I’m always scared. I have nightmares every single night about my worst fears and I have flashbacks about different procedures. Sometimes I’ll be sitting, doing nothing, and feel like a feeding tube is being forced down my nose. I know it’s not really happening, but I get so scared. A lot of traumatic things have happened to me and my doctors and mom make me feel like I’m being a baby about it. I’ve never sought help for any of these mental issues because I know I won’t be happy or okay til I’m normal. 
Not sick. Not in pain.

For my mom to tell me I have the easiest life in the world really hurts. I am in misery. I keep trying to claw myself out of where I’m at and recently, I’ve been happy! Or I thought I was. But last night I felt a little strange and then today this all happens and I realize I was never happy, 
i was just trying to pretend I was. I’m exhausted. I’m tired. I’m having a hard time breathing and I just want it all to be over. 
I don’t want to be alive, but I can’t make myself kill myself. I’m a coward. I pray every night that I won’t wake up the next day, so when I roll over and see the sun through my blinds, see the posters on my walls and feel that I’m still here, I’m upset. 
The one thing I want won’t happen unless I do it myself. And I can’t bring myself to do it, no matter how hard I try. 


What makes it so much worse is my grandmother (dad’s side) called me while I was writing this. She brought up how our entire family has been depressed and how she felt like she was in a fog. She told me this while I’m ranting about wanting to die. How cruel is that? 

Even worse, my grandfather wanted to talk to me. He is the only father figure I’ve ever known, the only man I’ve ever trusted and loved and 
my light and purpose. He is the only person to ever, fully love me. His love is unfaltering and he’s always been here for me. I had to give short responses because I was sobbing, but I’m really good at hiding it now, so I don’t think he noticed. 

And then he told me he loves me so much and to please take care of myself. He told me he loved me again. I broke. I think he might’ve heard me, but I don’t know. I needed that so badly, but the worst part is, it isn’t changing my mind. I still want to die. 
How can I be so cruel and selfish? 
That’s disgusting of me. 

I don’t even know if I want to send this now. But I just don’t know what to do. Want to die, but can’t do it. Coward. Don’t really want help, but here I am anyway. I just want someone to acknowledge me and understand. I want someone out there to understand why I want this and understand me. I want someone to know I exist as well. I don’t have any friends and few family that speaks to me. My mom is the only person that really talks to me. I dropped out of high school a while ago because of teachers claiming I was faking my illnesses and I can’t get a job because my immune system is so weak. I’ve had a cold for a month now. And I am a complete loser. 

I might sleep now. Actually sleep, not die. Still too much of a coward to do that.
 I doubt anyone will read this, but it feels good to be able to put it all out there. 
My head is busting and my eyes are so swollen. I don’t even much care, really. No where near as painful as my current thoughts. 

I’m sorry if you actually read this. 

TL;DR: your basic chronically ill, suicidal teen doing basic suicidal teen stuff. Angry at parent, wants to die, too much of a coward to do it."
3579,Rollercoaster of emotions,I just want to end it at this point. It’s like happiness only comes once in a while in short bursts. Then it’s just sadness and not wanting to be here anymore. I’m sad about a lot of things. Depressed with anxiety. But I’m just so tired of my mind being so cloudy. I thought I had a plan. But now I just see the inevitable. Been getting my hands on a drug that it’s likely to od from. I’m just waiting at this point.
3580,Im so effing angry I want to rip my heart out,F—- this life
3581,My birthday is coming up soon and I plan to die before,My 20th birthday is in a couple of weeks and all I want is to die. I have absolutely no direction and feel so empty. I plan on killing my self the day before
3582,40M i give myself until next year before i end it all,to my wife who loves me so much.  im sorry.  my social anxiety and my depression has gotten to the point where its too much to handle.  ive been prescribe different meds since i was in my 20s and yet im still stuck in this horrible place.  my rational self tells me i shouldnt be depress and i shouldnt he anxious but my fight or flight self is too powerful.  i cant quit my job because we have so bills to pay.  at least when i pass away you will only need to worry about yourself financially.  i wont be a burdon to you anymore.  im sorry you had to be stuck with a loser like me.  such a useless husband.  i love you from the bottom of my heart.
3583,i... can't hold on much longer,"i'm 16 (almost 17), and yes, i know that i might be too young to feel like this
i had a person lie to me for a whole year that they love me
it's been almost two months since we broke up, yet i can't get over it
and tonight some shit happened with them again
(and also, my mental state is getting worse and worse every day, to the point where i don't know what's real or if i am real
it's been going on for years now, and not even two hospitalisations couldn't help me) 


i'm gonna do it tomorrow
i'm losing first two classes, and i just.. need to find a building or something
i'm sorry for being pathetic, and i know that, if i tell them, they will tell me that i'm selfish
so i'm just gonna go quietly
if anyone would like to share a joke or something, it would be greatly appreciated, i just want to laugh a bit more
that's all, and stay safe everybody"
3584,I don't feel like there is a point.,"     As the title says. I don't see a point. All my feelings of not wanting to live and general hate for myself started 2 years ago. I was such a happy kid back then. I was joyful and didn't worry or care about the future or what others thought of me. I would wake up every day and jump out of bed getting ready for either school or just a regular day. But when I reached 7th grade... that's when everything began to fall apart.

     My parents started to become absent in my life. They were always there just not as they used to be. My mom always worked night shifts but used to find time in the morning for me. Now she drinks wine in the morning before she went to bed and sat around. She ignores me. My dad is a stay at home dad. He used to always be by my side but now he's kinda been absent. I used to love talking to him but now it's just stuff about him or him bashing my interests. He yells alot more and when something happens he always makes me feel bad for it like it's always my fault.

     I have an older sister but she has ignored me lately or shoved me and along with my dad bashed my interests. Everything is getting painful. I have less friends and the ones I have make everything about them. I can never vent to them because they turn it to be about them and I hate it. I'm their emotional crutch. I feel used. Even the girl who has a crush on me makes me feel used .

     I have self harmed. I'm ashamed of it and myself. Everything is becoming so hard for me and I don't know if I can carry on. I struggle to get up in the morning. I struggle to stay awake during school. I always feel miserable after eating. I feel like nobody would care if I died. Probably because they wouldn't. Everyone says they care for me or I'm not a disappointment but I am. I am a disappointment. Nobody cares. They pity me. The pity the depressed nonbinary kid who looks emo. They pity the kid sitting at lunch all by themself. My ""friends"" only sit with me because they pity me.

     I just can't take it anymore. I'm at my breaking point. These feelings have no sign that they'll stop. The constant teasing and bullying by kids in my school won't stop. It won't stop until I'm dead. All these thoughts in my head. The suicidal ones, the impulsive ones, they'll only stop when I'm dead. The only way this will all be over is the moment my heart stops. Nobody will truly understand what's happening to me until I die. That kid saying it's for attention won't understand it wasn't until the moment I rid myself from this world.

     I can't take it. I want help but everybody I turn too pushes me away, makes a joke about my feelings, or just flat out tells me to ignore it. They never provide help. Talking never helps. Nobody has helped me and I'm close to just ending it all. Nobody will probably read all of this. Even if they did they probably don't care. I'm struggling and I just want atleast someone to talk to me. Maybe it'll help since everyone I know ignores me. I just want to be happy again but that probably will never happen. I've been on the edge for a while.

     I probably won't live to be 18. I probably won't end up being the artist I've dreamed to be. My dreams won't come true. My dreams of getting a girlfriend or boyfriend or partner and getting a pet lizard together won't happen. I'm sick and tired of hoping. There isn't hope. My hope died a year ago. I just don't see a point. There isn't any emotion anymore. Just emptiness. I feel numb. I don't wish to wake up when I fall asleep. I want to die in my sleep. I think I've hit the end. The few days before I die. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow. Tonight. Maybe a week from now. I don't know. These could even be my last words. I hate struggling like this.

     I'm empty. Nothing left for me. There isn't a future for me. Just emptiness. I'll never find love. Never be the smart kid my parents wanted. I will never be the artist I want to be. I'm not set out for  life. I'm not set out to be here. This is a bunch of rambles but it needed to go somewhere. I keep bottling all this up and it's tearing me apart on the inside. I'm in pain. Not mentally but physically. I'm such a disappointment. It's just stupid to keep on living."
3585,Again,"After more than 3 months of peace, tonight I felt again the need to die. I felt miserable which made my wish to kill myself even bigger. I just hate what I do to the people around me, but I feel like I can’t continue anymore. It was good to be happy for this 3 months but I came back to reality. I don’t know what to do anymore!"
3586,Dumbest shit,"My ""friends"" reported me to the guidance counselor after I tried to hang myself and I got called down to his office. What happened was basically the world's most useless talk. Basically he said the classic line ""suicide is never the answer"" and then went on to talk about some psychologist who survived the Holocaust and watched his whole family die and if he didn't kill himself after experiencing that then I shouldn't too. He also went on about how my friends and family would be devastated blah blah blah. I really just don't care anymore. I'm pretty much just living for others at this point."
3587,It’s just too much and I don’t know if I can survive,"This is been a really bad 6 months. Everything that could go wrong has. I can’t even find the joy in things that used to make me happy. I don’t want to get out of bed. 
My grandma is slowly dying and I’m having to watch that. I’m also having to watch it rip my family apart. The holidays are horrible because everything is different and sad without her. 
My dad has dementia and I’m having to become his caretaker so my mom can take care of my grandma. No one has time to cook or clean at my house anymore. 
Stupid retail job is killing me. I’m “dating” a guy I really like but never actually get to see because of conflicting work schedules. I don’t really have any friends to hang out with. I don’t even have time to go have fun. 
On top of all the physical pain my body is in from work. 
I think about killing myself a lot these days but I don’t want to add more stress to my mom. I just want to run away from it all or for it all to be over. 
There’s so much more going on then what i posted here but these are the main ones."
3588,I don’t know what to do anymore,"My entire life I had never felt depressed or sad. I had a good childhood and the majority of my teen years were good too. I never really understood people that were depressed or just felt suicidal for no major reason. 

All of a sudden though, it is my senior year in high school and I have come to the conclusion that I am depressed and lately I’ve been contemplating killing myself. I know that I am depressed, but I just don’t understand why really. I know I’m depressed and sad because what used to be normal for me and things that I used to like have become nonexistent. 

I never used to sleep very much, but now all I do is sleep so I don’t have to stay awake and feel emotional pain, I used to eat normally and be try healthy, but now I’m never that hungry and eat kinda junky. I lost interest in a lot of the things I used to enjoy. I used to love playing piano, listening online, and printing new songs to learn, now I have no interest in playing. I’m a really competitive cross country/track runner and running has been a big part of my life. I find myself losing interest in training or at least wanting to train more and more. 

In the first month of school, I was excited for college and stuff and the rest of my senior year, but now I’m not looking forward to any of it. It’s so weird because I’ve never felt like this in my entire life. My mom has noticed the change in me and has become really concerned, but she isn’t used to this so she has trouble knowing how to help. I don’t really care though cause I don’t want help I just want to stop everything. 

My life in a way feels like a chore, but at the same time I kinda miss what I used to have and a small part of me wants to be like everyone else I see at school. I transferred to a new school as a junior and it was hard the first year there (this would be last year: 2018-19), but I wasn’t depressed or anything. It’s not like I don’t have friends or anything, I do. But I feel like I’m a kinda left out. I’m apart of the group, but I came to the school halfway through and I am not a full part of the group and it really hurts a lot. 

I know this sounds like stupid, but this is the kinda stuff I think about and makes me sad. This is kinda jumping all of the over place, I’m sorry. Anyway, I started out the first month (senior year) pretty fine. Then in October I had my first experience feeling depressed. Over the weekend I was just lethargic, unmotivated and felt really dark and sad inside. I never felt this way before, but it went away. 2 weeks later it happened again, except this time it felt a lot worse and I had a sort of emotional pain. It’s hard to describe, but I felt like my soil just hurt and I didn’t have anyone to go to even though I have friends, parents, siblings I could talk to but I just didn’t want to. 

Another week or so passed and since like sometime in November I’ve been feeling like this regularly. I sleep too much to mask the pain even though I’m not tired. I’ve lost interest in stuff, I procrastinate school work heavily. I find myself crying a lot as I watch other people enjoy their weekends with friends on social media and stuff and I just wish I felt normal and cools be apart of it. 

Now that it’s December I’ve kind of adjusted to the initial emotional pain it causes and I’m sort of used to it. What I mean is it’s not a shock to me anymore when I feel like this because it happens so often now, I don’t enjoy it though and I wish it would stop. I’ve been scrolling through the internet lately looking up suicide and different stuff or whatever. I usually cry when I do it because I know this isn’t me, but at the same time I don’t think anything is gonna change (trust me, it honestly isn’t) and I just want it all to end. I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up. 

As much as I want to just die, I’m scared to do it and I know it’ll affect a lot of people. My parents love me so much and it'd virtually ruin the rest of their lives. I have friends that I know will care and it’ll probably make their lives tough for like a few months which I don’t want to do. Nobody wants to hear midway though their senior year that someone they knew killed themselves, it just sucks. 

So ya, sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, it doesn’t make any sense to myself either. I just can’t see anything in life going in the positive direction. I’m not looking forward to the future, to graduation, to college, to adulthood, to freedom, to a job, to a family. 

Thanks for reading if you did, I didn’t think it’d get this lengthy."
3589,The good days are gone. Whats the point of anything,Every weekend I'm alone. I have no one. No one gives a flying fuck. Post a photo for attention. That's it. That's my life. I need to kill myself I really do.
3590,I can't kill myself and it's driving me insane,"I can't take it anymore. I work hard but I lose all my money to bills. No money for anything fun or healthy food. No money for therapy or meds, dont have insirance. Everything is so god damn expensive and everywhere you turn someone is trying to get money out of you. Have a shitty job because I had to drop out of college due to depression. All my friends are fake and use me. My family is dysfunctional and abusive. The world outside is going to hell, climate change, increasing political tensions, etc. 

I'm sick of it all. I feel like shit all the time. I don't want to play the game anymore. What's the point if I'm so miserable all the time? What's the fucking point?? But I havent been able to go through with it because I'm scared of what might happen after. Too miserable to live and too scared to die. It's a loop that's starting to drive me insane and all I do sometimes is just scream and scream and thrash around like a toddler because the pain is so much. I can't do anything else. It's degrading and awful and I hate myself for it but I'm in so much pain all I can do is just cycle through endless bouts of screaming/crying. I cry all the time. I cry at work because I can't stop it.

I'm afraid of what's going to happen, even if I don't eventually work up the nerve to kill myself. I feel like I'm losing it. I can't do it anymore, I really can't. I. Can't. Function. Every little thing feels like so much. I can't eat or sleep. You can tell me to buck up or whatever the fuck all you want but that does nothing. I don't know what's going to happen to me. I feel pressure like something's going to break. Like I might just snap one day and beat the shit out of someone for saying something rude to me. I would normally never want to hurt anyone. I've always been so averse to violence I even had a hard time play-punching my best friend as a kid, even when he told me to to see how hard I could hit. But this energy is bordering on hysterical.  I'm so exhausted and hurt from being pushed around by everyone and now whenever someone is mean to me I have such a strong urge to just hit them.

I've tried psych wards and meds and even ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy) and nothing has helped. It's all a joke. I'm unhappy because the world and the people in it are shit, and that's not excluding me. I think humans are flawed and headed for their end. I think we're all going to end up killing ourselves with our greed. We let people die because they can't afford it. I don't want to live in a world like that. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. Maybe I'll end up drooling in a straight jacket or maybe I'll end up dead. Someone please help me. Can someone give me some crumb of goodness? What can I do to get help in this deep of a state with no insurance? I can't live in my abusive parent's house anymore, if I had to return there after a hospital stay I'd still want to kill myself. I've been trying to save up to move out to no success. Shit keeps happening that I have to pay for: antibiotics for an infection, a new food handler's licence because the old one says it was taken five years ago when it fucking wasn't and should still be good. It's all too much. Why should I fucking bother? Help."
3591,i cant,"I suffer from erectyl disfuntion since i was 12,back then i was a star kid, good at sports, i had a girlfriend and plenty of friends, right now i cant sleep at night, i dont have friends or any contact besides my family and im in the worst shape of my life, i get headaches and my eyes hurt like crazy, since i cant sleep my skin turned very saggy and i look like im 40 and im just 19, my parents dont want to listen to me they tell me im crazy and i should start focusing on other things, ive seen and urologist in the past but i cant afford the surgery cost, we dont have any type of insurance and im going crazy, i have this pack of tremadol and i can overdose right now, but i cant since im afraid of faiulure, sorry for the bad english since it is not my native language."
3592,im a burden,"i dont know where else to go. doctors don't help and im tired of upsetting my partner with my suicidal depressive bullshit. 

i want to die. i desperately want to die. nothing helps and no one understands and maybe if im gone, everyone's lives will be easier bc then no one will have to deal with me. 

maybe tonight, when my dad's asleep. i can drive somewhere and take a whole bottle of ibuprofen so no one can find me until its too late. maybe ill drive to the bridge so that if the pills don't work, ill only have to get out of the car, walk a ways, and jump. it's a long drop. 

or maybe not. maybe ill just keep fasting and go to sleep. maybe if i fast long enough my heart will give out and it would just look like my shitty health caught up with me. but then someone might find me before it's too late.

idk. i just want to go. everything is so cold and there's nothing ahead of me. everyone will move on."
3593,Just a gaze upon my table.,"Day after day i'm losing meaning of things. Things i used to love are turning into complete garbage. I have a few will to do such an easy thing as cleaning up my hair. It's been a while since I had properly washed myself -- without just standing still and stupidly under the shower. 

I'm taking a gaze upon my table, my room and my reflection in the mirror. 

Piles of excersise books. Wrappers. Empty bottles of nose drops and glue. Bottle caps. Coins. Pieces of paper. Pens. Cables and wires. A bowl full of breadcrumbs. 

Eyes wander over a room. Dress is piled up everywhere. Everything is in a complete mess. 

Floor is full of dust and dirt. 

And here i am looking at myself.

If I only never existed, it could be better. 

Because I am full of dust and dirt as well and have no will to wash it all away."
3594,Getting help is hard.,"I really want to get some help, but it feels like reaching out is impossible. My parents are just gonna go like ""Don't talk like that"". I'm gonna have one conversation with my friends and then they're gonna think it's all better. I told 2 people I'm suicidal and the responses I get are ""Your life is so much better than a lot of people's, so don't do it"" and ""Do it, you coward"". So yeah, I don't think I can get help, even though I want to."
3595,I started researching how to kill myself,"I haven't done that in a looong ass time. That's how I know I'm back at rock bottom.

It's the only thing I can focus on. Probably cause it's the only thing I care about now. Everything else is just fucking brain fog."
3596,What is left to do about a squandered life?,"Lately, with the help of alcohol, I've been going through my childhood memories. I've come to the realisation that my childhood was just full of traumatic experiences, in large due to my own doing. I'm afraid of everything: afraid to love, afraid to look ridiculous, afraid to look like my family.

I've been asleep, a sickening lethargy, for most of my childhood. It wasn't since the age of 17 that I awoke briefly, then dormant again. And from 22 onwards I've been awake, I can see what I did wrong; how clownish I behaved, how I never recognised that I had a sexuality even as a child and how that lead to traumatic experiences.

How I was always drawn to the arts, to literature, but how I thought that was *not my territory*. How me and my twin brother brought the worst out in ourselves; echoing insecurities to dramatic effect. How I've felt like a caretaker since infancy. How I've always felt that my mother picked my dad mainly to procreate with.

And how I always felt like my father when confronted with a woman, and could see my smile on my brother's face and felt disgust. And could see my head in my father's head and felt disgust.

It seems the only thing I'm good at is to be a cowardly wise-ass; I taunt people, make them think, I fish for people's affection but walk away when it gets real.

I'm a fraud, nothing but a fraud. I'm 30 going on 31 and I'm just a traumatised child who was dormant. It all just seems forlorn. 

Why should any of you want to see me live? You don't know me; I am a tragic creature but also a good actor. People mistakenly think I'm worthy.

I've disclosed my whole disgusting childhood memories and how I might have compromised others to my therapist, in writing with every detail, at the end of the last session. The first thing I'll notice is the look in her eyes when she opens the door. Where she previously seemed to like me, if she has a look of disgust or pitiful, then I will know. I will finally know."
3597,Ending it tonight,Wanted to wait a little longer initially but it's not working out. Finally I'll be able to sleep and stay asleep. Wish all of you the best.
3598,Despite leading a relatively nice life I think about suicide daily,"I’m mid-thirties, good job, nice car, nice family. I would say I’m fairly attractive. I guess I’m not your typical suicidal person.

I do have some big ups-and-downs in my life like anybody else, sometimes they are manageable and sometimes I sit and think of different ways to kill myself. 8 years ago after a heavy night of drinking and heartache I wrote a suicide note and got a knife to cut my wrists but I didn’t go through with it.

Recently I’ve been thinking about driving somewhere remote and leaving the engine on, feeding the fumes back into the car. I feel guilty because there are so many people out there who can’t catch a break but soldier on, and here’s me thinking of ending it constantly. 

I suspect I may have bi-polar or something similar but I’ve never been to see anybody about it.

I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I guess I can’t talk to anybody about it in real life. I’m not feeling suicidal right this moment but it comes and goes."
3599,What is paracetamol? Is aspirin a paracetamol? I am confused,
3600,Has anyone ever shot themselves?,Im looking into buying one online
3601,Ending it tonight,"Initially I planned to be patient and wait up until my birthday, but I can't for the love of everything hold on any longer. I've set my helium tank up, got my bag, everything is ready. Now all I'll need to do is ready myself and close my eyes forever. The pain will be over."
3602,Help,"no, dont, I'm fine"
3603,I am going to kill myself and I have set a date. I don’t want my parents to suffer. What can I do beforehand to make it easy as possible for my family?,
3604,This is my suicide note. Is it good?,"Goodbye.
I don’t want you guys to think this is all your fault. It’s not. It’s not even remotely your fault. You guys actually were the ones who were the reason I put this off for so long, but I’m fucking done. Every year has been stress, bullying, loneliness, worrying, sadness, pain. I can’t go on with life anymore. If you get this, I cared about you. I want you to live the rest of your life and forget that I ever was alive and be happy. The ones that caused this were bully and bully. It was their fault. I loved you all, and hope you guys do well. I cannot stress this enough. I love you, if you got this, and this WASN’T YOUR FAULT. Goodbye, I loved you - My name."
3605,I bought a pack of cigarettes,"I flipped one to the other side. I will smoke that one last, after I do I will kill myself. I have tried everything to help myself but every time I get close something comes and ruins everything. My only hope up until today was microdosing lsd, but today because of my lack of money and lsd plugs I realised that is not an option. I don't smoke a lot so the pack will probably last a week, enough time to write a note."
3606,I may just write another suicide notes not for soon but I'll be sure before i hit 30 I'll die so people who will find my book and other places with notes of it will understand,I think I've written like 4 now every few years. No I've no plan for soon or next year but I'll be sure to be gone before 30
3607,Anyone else finds it hard to socialize let alone be in a romantic relationship?,"M24. No friends. Never been in a real relationship. Ghosted a bunch of ""friends"" after getting rid of some nasty habits. 

As I get older I find myself with the grater urge to form meaningful relationships, but depression has taken over to a point where I'm a dull person. I do things but I do not care about them. I'm just boring. As soon as I open my mouth I simply want the conversation to end. I think its because I fake it all the time? I just have to.

No desire to do anything, to be anything, other than for pain to stop. I have nothing to offer to another human being. I think I yearn for a relationship with another human being simply because I want someone to see the real me, I want to tell all my secrets, how I feel - to another human being. I want someone to see my suffering. I think I think that another person can fix me.

Thank you for reading. Needed to vent."
3608,I had a dream that I killed myself last night,"Ive had suicidal thoughts for a long time, but this is the first dream. It made me realize that this is an option I can take seriously.

I saw how it happened, step by step I watched myself do it. And I wasn’t scared, it felt normal and natural almost like I’ve done it before. 

So yea, I’m really thinking about it now. I have the plan, I just need the date and the courage."
3609,I'm so close to do it and now I'm terribly afraid,"I don't see any other options for me but now that I'm nearly ready, I'm afraid of death. I know that it's because I want to live a good life but it won't happen, I only know suffering so I just want to die. I'm so afraid of death, I want to fix something I can't and I'm terrified"
3610,popping pills,"i just wrote out the note and im popping pills in bed. i hate existance. and i feel completely and utterly disposable.My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me after saying that im annoying and a terribke boyfriend. and she told me that she wouldnt care if i killes myself. and now she wont even reply. she just leaves me on read. i know this sounds so pathetic but she was the only one who actually made my days bearible. and now that shes gone i feel just empty. nothing else can replace her. and im just tired of pretending that i can cope. it feels like my friends dont really care or understand what im going through. i just feel so alone. i hope i dont wake up.

ps ive been depressed for over 4 years now"
3611,I like to pretend being asleep is like being dead and maybe some day soon it actually will be. Here’s my soul for you to read,"For me the last time I was somewhat happy was in high school and I owe it perhaps to having my life controlled by school, something I don’t care to admit . I went to college and wanted to study medicine but depression kicked in and it really affected every aspect of my life : I didn’t do well in school , gained a bunch of weight , had no friends . I was lucky in a sense that I didn’t have too much financial worry . I am also gay and really hate it because gays are extremely mean and judge you based on how you look , something even I do . I wasn’t even out as gay in school because I was told I couldn’t have a career being gay in America ( in medicine ) and I was and am deathly afraid of hiv/ aids ruining my life if I get it which made me afraid to be intimate, so I didn’t care about my looks or anything because of it . I guess the old artistic trope of gay men doing suicide has some merit to it based on my life . I am now 26 and life seems so painful and short . Despite my parents paying for my state school tuition and rent ( modest rent ) I never had too much financial problems , but now am poor making $15/hr. I just look around now and wonder what the hell this all means , I look around and see nothing but darkness and despair . It just hurts to wake up sometimes"
3612,what is wrong with me?,"even though i smile, i feel happiness, i am still lonely. this emptyness in my heart and the physical pain out-through my body aches every day. i think i am depressed but afraid to go to the doctors because what if they put me in a ward and i do not get better. i am a ninteen year old who is in college yet i am still in pain. i think my time is done. i am constantly getting bullied by women (i am a woman myself) and men contanstly flirting with me, trying to get under my pants, i feel distraught and cannot help to think if i should c\*t myself. i have not done it in years but i have the temptation."
3613,I have BIG sad,"I can't think of my future like it is going to last 60 or 70 years(I am 14). Every second not listening music or being high is just pain and suffering.

Even interactions with my family are plain and boring even tho I care and love them.

I also noticed the extreme spike in thinking about dying and suicide. I started joking about killing myself around a year ago and since about 6 months ago I cought myself thinking of methods of suicide multiple times a week.

Suicede feels like the easiest way out and I am realy worried about that.

I don't know if this is unnecisery or an acctual problem.

Thanks for any advice and apologies for any gramatical errors."
3614,"I wanted to end it , but my friend told me that when I do something bad to myself he is going to do something bad to hymself too .","What now ? :/

Well FUCK"
3615,Today is probably the day.,"I’m currently outlining a plan.  I’ll execute the plan once I get my apartment tidied up, so that people don’t see the mess that I’ve built up over these last six days.  I know that I’ll be found relatively quickly.  I do indeed have people who care about me, but it’s really not something that will stop me.  I don’t think that “there are so many people who care!!!” is a particularly compelling argument against ending my own pain.  They can care to the moon and back and it won’t stop whatever bullshit my life has decided to conjure up.

People say that life gets better, and it does, but only for a month or two at a time.  I’m going through a lot right now.  Everything has come down on me, and I know that everyone is going to think it’s their fault, even though it really isn’t.  It’s a decision I made myself.  One I’ve been contemplating for a long time.  I’ve had my note written for 6 months.  I told myself that if things are improved in 6 months, it will have been a sign.  Things are exponentially worse.  The note is still applicable, but will need more tweaks.  I’ll send a text message to the one person I know will blame himself the most, an apology for everything.  Out of context and without the knowledge of what I’m about to do, it will just look like I’m apologizing.

I tried once in 2017.  I got close—every morning I was in the hospital doctors would tell me that they were surprised at how my kidneys were bouncing back, that they were very worried about my numbers in the beginning.

This time, I will be successful.  I live alone now, my friend who took me to the hospital that first attempt doesn’t talk to me much anymore, and my friends who care wouldn’t go as far as coming here to check on me.  The only tip anyone will receive is my note, but everyone I know lives far enough away from me (at least 20-30 mins) that it will be too late if they do decide to come for me.  Plus, there’s the time in between them actually finding the note and then reading it.  If anything, they’ll start to get worried tomorrow afternoon when they realize I haven’t said anything to anyone and I haven’t come in.  I will make sure I’m successful.  It will be an extremely uncomfortable/painful experience for about 6 seconds, but after that... It won’t matter."
3616,privileged teenager wants to commit suicide because they’re selfish,"i’m 16 in two weeks, i have the best mum in the world who loves me so so much, we aren’t rich and have mild money struggles but there is always food on the table and i go to a really good school and get good grades. Basically i have a great life and the only thing i can attribute to my constant suicidal thoughts and depression is my dads abrupt death when i was 12 that i have never dealt with or gotten over. So so many people have it far worse than me, in fact i’ve got it pretty great and yet every few days i stare at some paracetamol willing myself to take it and just not have to deal with anything anymore. I feel so guilty cus so many people have it worse than me, so many people would kill to have a great mum like mine etc yet i want to throw it all away, it’s disgusting but i can’t help it and i just want to kill myself. I have reasons to stay i just don’t want to, it’s so so selfish and i feel sick just typing it but i’m too tired and just don’t want it anymore. 

I’m sorry to everyone that has real problems that reads this and understands how selfish i am."
3617,I self harm to keep myself alive,"Imagine being 8 years old and having a knife held to your throat for cutting your hair, and being told by your mother that she wishes god kills you off. Yeah, started self harming at 13 and have never stopped since. 

Not to mention, my mom is extremely gorgeous. She used her beauty to steal all my fathers money and me and my dad lived in poverty while she was out shopping with friends and talking to her sugar daddies. Great childhood!

I help others and act like I have life made out for me when I really slit my wrists every night because I never had a fucking mom. 

My mom was my first bully, and now I’m super insecure and try to be other people’s mother to cope. 

I feel so sad right now, I just need someone to talk to or to tell me that it’ll be okay..."
3618,"I'm so ungrateful wtf. Like I have a partner, friends and I'm completely able-bodied living in a 1st world country w access to education","I dont even know why I'm posting this here but I feel like idk I cant pass a bridge w/o having immense difficulties to suppress the desire to jump down anymore. Since my earliest childhood I've just had daydreams of different ways of dying and it always made me feel some sort of internal happiness. The first time I attempted was when I was about 12-13 but the thing I wanted to hang myself on broke. Started self hurting at primary school age and haven't stopped since although it was more when I was 12-13. 
Around 6 months ago I decided I'd definitely kill myself, already walking to the railway but a very special person unknowingly stopped me from doing it. A bit later they became my boyfriend and we've been a couple ever since. But everything I do is hurting him. I can see how sad he is that I have these thoughts and how much its pulling him down and as I'm almost sure I'm gonna do it in the next few days I suggested breaking up to him and explained that he really shouldn't be in a relationship w someone like me, but he just refuses to accept or admit how bad this is for him. He's the only person on this planet I actually care about, as I do not have any sort of connection to my family more than sharing a house (taken away by CPS at 11 but bro8ght back at 13) and I do have friends, but i just feel so numb when talking to them. All in all I'm just an ungrateful cunt that's being a terrible girlfriend and deserves to die"
3619,Really really suicidal,I’m not going to do it but I just want to collapse in tears and die
3620,Ending my life on Christmas night.,"Everything I do is a bust. It is why I am ending my life on my birthday next year in January. I am tired of being a failure and nothing ever working out or going good for me. I just can't handle it anymore. I have spent ten years trying to get a car to live in and when I finally bought one last year I got scammed out of 2.5k usd dollars.
 
I am tired of fighting to try to stay above water and all I am doing is slowly drowning. I have spent the past ten years trying to get out of Texas, get a GED, or find an apartment based on income or HUD housing, even tried for ten years now to find a room to rent I could afford while on disability. I have spent the past ten years trying to get on my feet and all I get is knocked down. 

I now rent a bedroom from an elderly woman who makes it miserable for me to live here. I have no where else to go. I have tried rooms for rent and they want too much or they won't allow me to rent to them. I was supposed to get my first apartment in February this year but I needed eye surgery at the end of February so I lost that apartment. 

I have spent the past eight years in the dating scene on every dating site free and paid and every dating sub up and down on reddit but all I get is rejected, told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, I have nothing to offer woman. I am trash, I don't deserve to be loved or in a relationship. Ghosted, told to end my life, laughed at, mocked at, made fun of. 

I been morbidly obese since I was 6 years old no matter how healthy I ate or how active I was. growing up I never was allowed anything but veggies and salads and chicken thanks to my grandma trying to keep me skinny but it never helped the weight piled on for no reason. In 1996 I was up to 700 lbs. I am now at and around 450lbs. I am 38 and have struggled with it my entire life. I was rejected by a woman 6 days ago who was around 350lbs and told me I need to lose weight and get around 200 lbs before I even consider dating or someone being with me but yet she was well over 300lbs herself and replied to my dating post. 
 
I am on disability and have tried for ten years to find a job either online or in person like a desk job or computer gig job but everything I find requires skills I don't have or can't do even if I tried learning them. I can't do manual labor anymore because I have arthritis in my lower back, knees and feet. just last week I went to go wash clothes and my arthritis was acting up in my feet and it felt like every step I took was stepping on shards of glass and nails. I also have learning issues where it takes me longer to learn things than other people and even then sometimes I still can't learn them no matter how much or how long I try. And trust me, I do try. it isn't just a few months then give up, no it is a year or two then still not getting anywhere that is when I decide to give up.

I just can't keep living life like this and spend another ten years or more like this. Constantly fighting to stay afloat and not getting anywhere and no matter how hard I try I just end up right back in the same spot as if I never did anything or made a phone call or filled anything out. It will be as if I never even tried and all the work and energy and time and effort and ideas I have put to use  never happened. I have spent ten years being homeless and on the streets no one ever helping me or giving me a chance. busting my ass trying to get a job but all I could get was day labor jobs or season jobs that were cash under the table. 

I just can't do another ten years or more. I can't spend another waking minute living this failure of a life and this lonely life having absoltuely not one friend or family member and constantly spending every waking moment by myself, no one to watch stuff with or share things with or who has my back or just someone there to listen to me. I haven't been hugged since 1997. last time anyone told me they loved me and meant it, it was my cat and back in 1995 when he meowed at me and licked my cheek before I had to have him to down because of cancer in his jaw.

I live in a dead end town with absolutely nothing but a Walmart, 30 fast food places. No uber, no lyft, no taxi, no bus. nearest town is one hour away one way and it is mostly nothing but dr's offices, hospitals, clinics, banks, fast food places. Nearest flea market is 3 hours away one way. I can't escape this town and I can't better my life. 

I just can't keep living life like this and spend another 10 or so years like this constantly fighting and trying to find things to help better my life then it just blows up in my face. Its like asking someone to live ten years with cancer and no pain meds no chemo. Its like slowly being cut into by a dull scalpel from a dr and being fully awake and no pain meds or anything to put you out. I am done. On Christmas  I am going to end it. I can't keep doing this or living life like this. I just can't do it. I am done."
3621,I can't go on if life is like this,"Everything in my life has gone to shit. I lost my girlfriend a few months ago. We have been talking but that is about it. We have been rough but she has expressed being happier without me. I think that she thinks that I am stupid. She likes being with her friends more. I discovered recently that my father and his siblings have disowned me. They manipulated my dad into thinking that I am someone that I am not so that I could be omitted from his trust (so that they will inherit everything). I wasn't allowed to come to Thanksgiving. I'm not welcome at Christmas. My fire department called me today and told me that I signed up for a shift that I did not show up for last night.  As a result I will probably need to resign, at a bare minimum I wont be able to go on any shifts anymore. Almost everyone in my fire department hates me.  I get no respect as a female in the fire service. I have been volunteering consistently for 2 years. I have no friends. Nearly no family except for my mother. I have issues at work, I have been fired repeatedly at work with having done nothing wrong (I'm a teacher). My current job is now on a thread. If I died no one would care, no one would miss me. Honestly if life is this shitty, then I just don't want to be part of it. I feel like I have accomplished everything that I have wanted to do, crossed off every item on my bucket list.  I have gained too much weight, about 20 pounds this year from all of the stress. I just can't deal with being in agony any longer. I see no good in the world, and I see no value in me. I feel completely misunderstood and alone."
3622,"I am scared of me . I don't wanna die , but at the same time I do.","Since the last hour I am having extreme mood swings . I feel empty , depressed and than I laugh and  think about killing myself .

3623,Everything I Do Is A Mistake,"Why is it whenever I do something, It all leads me down into a shitty person.... I can't take this."
3624,i am useless,"
I know it’s stupid. But my medication isn’t working. I still don’t see myself making it to 2020. I’ve already posted my crap here. But like I don’t know. I feel so useless. I’m such a burden. I’m a burden to my mom because I had to drop out of college to see my therapist more. I’m a burden to random people people because whenever someone asks how I’m doing I can’t keep my cool and just start sobbing. I am a burden. I miss my late father, late friend, and the god damn million other people that have left my life. I just want to be with them. 
I am so useless. I currently am employed at a store. And it’s a shaky business at best. I try to bring in lots of stuff from home, charger, pens, jewelry bags, Sale Signs, notebooks and other things. They used to praise me and now they loathe me. I handmade some business cards for the store while we wait for our shipment to come in. They threw them away. And have started getting rid of some stuff I brought in. I don’t know, it’s so trivial. But it’s little things that build up that make me feel like such a piece of shit."
3625,Narcissism is killing me,"I’m a narcissist. Text book. It’s in all the articles online. I have all the classic traits. It’s ruined my marriage. 
And now I think I’m done. I can’t go on being me. I’ve hurt my husband too much. I have too much to change. I’m too damaged. And too psycho and too weird and childish and stupid to go on. 
Even writing this is narcissistic. 
I can’t handle being me any more"

3627,About my forced unwanted life... and how I think about life in this world of the horrible humanity,"Reddit is the only place where I can 'meet' people who roughly think like me.
One of my problems is that unfortunately I am surrounded by people who love it to live and who are even fascinated from life, no matter what things they have to do or what happens. I hate them for being like that and they don't understand me. That are the reasons why I decided to stop keeping contact to my 'friends'. I can't stand their setting of life anymore and the topics they always talk about. I don't have someone who really understands my way of thinking. Only my mum is OK but actually I want to have someone else who I also can talk to!
I am 18 years old, female and I live in Germany (so English isn't my native language, sorry if my English isn't perfect)


I have always hated to live. The only activity which I love is sleeping. I fought myself through eleven school years.
I was always very very stressed because of school and many nights I had no time left to sleep before school starts again. I found it sooo cruel! 🤯🤯😱🤢🤮My grades were good but I hate everything. This school year I finally broke up school. I don't have real interests and nothing can give me such pleasure that I want to keep living! I think life is pointless!!! I hate humanity and I feel terrible to be one of them and it's very horrible that the humans force me to live. I am very angry about it.

And I totally hate the system of humans life. I mean the schools, the world of working, the amount of bureaucracy, money, environmental pollution, ..................
I never want to take part in it❗ Besides the world is already overpopulated and soon is going to collapse because of all the disgusting humans. It's a shame for me to be forced into this world and I wish it has never happened to me. 
The only thing I can hope is that I don't still have to stay for a long time in this prison of my human life. 
Best wishes from me to all of you who agree with me

3628,"The Ruin, The Release, The End.","Growing my parents cared more about my approval of them, over the approval of myself. They did things for me so I'd be happy, but more so happy with them.. instead of things to make me a man. On top of sheltering me.. it turned me into a big baby.. who's co dependent.. and  now I'm stuck in those ways.. cause it's all I've ever known. Idk what they ""expected"" of me.. like I would just be totally different than the way the were raising me.. I was raised as a spoiled rich kid.
 But was never rich. My dad would always make me feel like shit comparing myself to him.. but never once compared himself to his dad.. on actually being a dad. He ruined my potential as an athlete first off. I see kids playing now and think.. if I wasnt morphed into a giant fat ass.. I wouldve been much better on top of not self conscious and worried about how I look.. I only got to play when the seasons came around.. unless it was just by myself with a hoop for example.. unlike the other kids.. who were a friends and got to hang and play with each other year round.. no wonder I never broke out.. when I'd play street ball, and was playing all the time.. a d confident in myself, I was great and would dominate..even while still being fat.. but he didnt care if I grew up a diabetic I guess.. part of me thinks he wanted me to be like him growing up.. fat and nerdy.. for some selfish reason. So I was made fun of and an out cast.. I went from a skinny popular outgoing kid, to a fat loser stick in head when he came into my life.. and he always knew best according to him.. look how that turned out. Hell say he tried, he did everything right.. if that was the case I wouldve turned out much better. He did nothing his own dad did. He wanted me to be like him.. yet all I got was his fat body at the time. I was intelligent, naturally. I was a great school student.. which that was ruined thanks to my inability to focus cause my ass was parked in front of a tv, either watching cartoons or playing video games all the time. I did go out and play.. sometimes.. when I had the chance to.. to be with other kids.. which was rare.. most of the time I was trapped at grandmas house with no choice but sit my ass in front of a tv and get fed custard pie and pink milk. I'd go out and shoot hoop by myself sometimes.. but by yourself.. that would only keep my mind occupied for so long.. hed play with me sometimess.. for like a half hour maybe.. till he said ok I'm tired.. or just one game and that was it.. we'd throw the baseball around for 15 mins before he dodnt want to amymore.. nevermind football.. he didnt let me play no matter how much I wanted to, cause he was afraid my knees would get messed up. Which never fuxking happens.. what like a handful of professional? PROS?!?! I wouldve steam rolled through the kids I wouldve played against.. it wouldve helped keep me in shape also.. playing g football and practicing all summer rather tha  getting fat eating brownies, donut sticks, pop tarts, fruit loops cocoa pebbles, hot pockets, beefaroni, pink milk, custard pie, what ever it is. Cause he was too scared of the world and passed that on to me.. and I was too scared to argue with him about it, cause no matter what he was ALWAYS right. Even though looking back he chose wrong on a lot of shit.. ever since he hit me for freaking out when I was what 3? Cause I locked myself in the room on accident due to a fucked up door handle.. he got mad, yelled at me and hit me because I was a little kid scared from being locked in a room. What a fucking asshole.. for the softy he is, I was always scared of him more than anything.. and it was all a mental fuck more than anything.. I never swore or dis respected him in anyway.. going  back to his dad.. he just never made me do anything to learn discipline.. I was never even grounded.. I think he took my tv away for a day once. Half a day actually I got it back that night, after a few hours. He cared more about my approval of him, and just doing things by the book rather than teaching me how to be a man..I was better off without a father figure at all in my life.. he also gave up on me.. years ago, told my mom it would hurt her more than him if I ended up dead. I see him sometimes now.. I remember meeting his girl friend for the first time.. shes actually really sweet and I have nothing against her at all.. that being said.. he actually acted like he cared about me alot.. the first time in a long time I saw him putting enthusiasm and emphasis into me.. and he would continue to do that.. when she was there.. I began to really care about him again.. I dont think I ever not cared about him.. he was there my whole life and I've always loved and respected him no matter what.. but than I'd see him without her there.. and it was like it was before.m sure hed talk a little to me, but he didnt really give a shit.. when she was around her act like father of the year.. when she's not there.  I don't even exist.. showing me he was just putting on an act in front of her. I dont even matter to him anymore.. the only person i matter to truly is my mom.. everyone else would get over me being gone rather quickly.. which is fine.. but him.. I wish he was never in my life now.. I dont wish him to be unhappy.. or anything bad towards him, I just wish he was never a part of my life.. I love my mom, but she needs to be able to live without me.. shes obsessed with me and has been for a while.. which needs to end.. if and when I do end my life.. I just hope she can move on and live her own life. If she says something like she'd do it to if I did.. than that proves shes obsessed with me which isnt right. She shouldn't  need her son to live.. I understand being sad.. I get that.. but she has more to live for than just me.. like everyone else does. I've thought about it, how ending my life would hurt her.. and it really upsets me.. to the point I'd thinking I shouldnt do it.. but not now.  If I have the opportunity to do it
. I will follow through.. I'm just scared of the pain.. I dont want to go through pain while doing it.. so it's hard finding a way to end my life without experiencing some sort of excruciating pain. I would need a shot gun, potassium cyanide, a shit load of very potent opiates to inject, or a way to end it with carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. I know I have to work hard, be patient, and work my way out of this mess if u am to get out of it. But that's the thing, I dont have discipline or drive to do anything, and it just causes more anxiety and misery just doing the steps I need to do, to get through it.. on top of not even knowing what it is my life would have a purpose doing. So I gave up a while ago, now it's just a waiting game, till I can figure out the method of ending my life. If you read this, you cant change my mind, if you try, I appreciate the gesture. You're a kind soul, but it was a waste of time. I dont want sympathy, and no words from anyone can change this out come. Good bye."
3629,Watching other people have more people to back them up and you don't have any really sucks.,"Every time someone tries to mistreat me, I always have to stand up for myself for some reason, and it really feels like im lonely"
3630,Stupid problems,"I hate myself a lot. My problems aren't real, I'm just a little cunt begging for attention. Nothing traumatic happened to me, I'm not starving to death and I'm pretty healthy. Even with all of that, I feel like shit everyday. I have a very heated relationship with my mother and I'm underage so I can't get therapy by myself. Every day feels like a test
Will I be able to hide my emotions well-enough?
Will I survive the temptation to jump out of the building and die?
Will I fucking stay sane?
Nothing helps, things are only getting worst and worst. I'm getting blamed for more and more and I'm being tasked with doing more everyday. I don't know what to do anymore. No matter what I try, I can't force myself to study, can't make myself useful. And yes, I'm getting blamed for it daily. I wish that I would be brave enough to just cut open my throat in front of everyone and die, I bet their attitude towards me would change instantly."
3631,Why is life so exhausting?,"Hello, this is my first time using reddit so sorry if I'm doing something wrong.

I just wanted to know if anyone can tell me why life is so exhausting and what I could do to change this attitude besides suicide. 

What's bugging me about life is the fact that I have to do this shit for like 60 more years.
Waking up, going to work, going home, sleeping and then repeating the same routine.
Don't get me wrong, I love my job and I do go out with friends casually, but the thought that I have to stay alive another couple of decades is only making me more tired of life.

Also my girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me 3 days ago and although that's not the main reason I want to ""go"", It's definitely making everything worse.

I have always been a sad child but being of turkish descent, topics like depression are like a taboo for my parents. I once told my mom about seeing a psychologist but she yelled at me for talking such ""nonsense"" (in her words) so you see it's a little bit complicated to get help.

I would really appreciate some advice on how to change this attitude of mine or otherwise I think I might end my life some day.

Sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors, I'm not a native speaker."
3632,What reason is there to live?,"If not for anybody else. 

WHY do I have to stay alive? Why can’t I find the courage to kill myself? If a 12 year old can do it, I should be able to do the same.

And I will. Eventually."
3633,I’m a coward,"I’ve wanted to end it since I was 13 (F18) but I’m always too scared of the “what if’s.” What if it hurts really badly and I don’t finish the job? Then I’ll be in a psych ward? Even worse, I’ll be miserably a vegetable or something"
3634,I'm so mad for my inability to kill myself,Every day I think about it  and can never go through with it. I feel so sad and yet I'm scared of dying and never feeling anything for eternity. be it good or bad feelings
3635,My friend is suicidal and I don’t know what to do anymore,"I’m sorry to be posting like this but I’m really at a loss here. Me and one of my other friends has a friend whose been suicidal for awhile now. We’ve tried pretty much everything (support, advice, etc) but I feel like it’s not enough. I feel like it keeps getting worse as recently, they haven’t talked to either of us anymore and when they do, it’s about how life is a nightmare. I’m worried they’ll end their life. Does anyone know what I should do?"
3636,Please help me.,I’ve been feeling really down for a while. Anxiety and negative thoughts are eating me up and I just can’t take it anymore.
3638,"The weight on my shoulders and I think its time to go, I keep on thinking about this situation for a year now","I need help I don't know what to do sometimes I feel like to sleep forever and never wake up. My brother fought with my cousin a year ago and I still can't get over it. My cousin kept on giving my brother side comments, used him as a scapegoat, character assassination, kept on saying stuff over and over again. It pissed me off so I yelled at her to stop because it got to my nerve imagine constantly hearing""Bob this, Bob that, Bob is like this, Bob is a druggy ..."" etc. . That's my brother and I had enough and yelled at her because she wouldn't stop. Fast forward 2 weeks and my brother came back from uni and mind you whenever her brother come backs from uni they cut a cake for him like congratulation on finishing your 2nd year of med school. Anyway's, my other cousin invited us to a party and they live across the street my brother asked them for a ride and they said NO. I got pissed off like never before and I told my dad and someone they heard about it. They then have like some annual secret santa we were invited and all my cousins ganged up on my brother and me, being passive aggressive to us, giving us side comments. My cousin called my brother reta\*\*\*\*, druggy, stupid, and ruining her image. All of sudden my brother got super pissed and told my cousin to ""Sh\*\* the f\*\*\* up, you cu\*\* or I am gonna smack you"" I have personally never seen him that angry at all not even with me. He all of sudden stormed outside and all of sudden she ran upstairs like she was kid. My brother is 20 and my cousin is 28 - 29, no one talks to us and its always occupying my mind and I don't know what to do? They later told us that we are abusive etc. While she makes up lies, and is just toxic because she is paranoid. All my cousins made excuse's for her behavior that she is older then us so she can say that. Everyone pretty much estranged us and don't talk to us. My mind keeps on thinking about this and its been like 11 months already and I don't know what to do? I think that me and my brother are abusers and stupid, I shouldn't deserve to live. I joined the army too hoping to make my mind stronger and get a brotherhood and stop caring about people. I don't know what to do? I feel so low and on top of this I have exams and this keeps pop's in my mind."

3640,"About to lose my wife, I can’t stop thinking that I’d be better off falling from a bridge.",Me and my wife have been fighting a lot the last few weeks. Last night she kicked me out and told me that she doesn’t love me anymore. We were living with her mom who said that we both need to take a week or two apart. I’ve been with her the last 5 years and accomplished so much together. Ever since last night I keep wanting to just lean over a bridge and let go. I feel like I’ve been nothing but useless to her. I just feel all my options are gone because I don’t know how to fix things. If just want the pain to end. If I’m dead than I won’t be a problem to anyone anymore.
3641,"why juice wrld, why not me?","fuck it i'm not even a fan of him but you can't deny that he was a young guy full of potential and it just fucking enrages me thinking that good people like him keep dying but not me. he had millions of fans, definitely helped some people cope with their shitty lives daily and i? i don't contribute to society at all. i'm a useless fucking piece of rotting garbage, a waste of air. might as well just slice my wrist open right now and it won't make a difference for nobody. i wish i had that seizure instead of him."
3642,"No reason to continue living, nothing to live for","I feel an absolute lack of motivation to continue living. Nothing dramatic, it all went to this situation for a very long time.

I have nothing to live for: friends? mostly lose them, it seems I have none within 300 miles around now; love? no gf for some ten years, likely I'm undateable considering the amount of rejectiosn which I faced. goals? they mean nothing. hobbies? just waste of time. I don't even fit well into modern society, and neither I like it, as for me it's totally rotten."
3643,I need help,"One of my friends had been acting extremely strange and I'm worried. She's been sending pictures of bloody bandages on his wrist to me and a picture of a knife with ""Hi (my name)"" written next to it. This is seriously fucked up but I don't know how to help without making things worse. Please. Any advice would be appreciated."
3644,"Could easily do it, any day I wanted. I could be dead within the next 5 minutes. But I still haven’t.","I’m currently in possession of two mega potent opioids (1-2mg will kill a non-tolerant user), and have been planning to die for a long time.


Thing is, these drugs have kept me going for years now. I only got into them in order to die in the first place. But ironically, they helped me change my life up completely. I’m viewed as a “success” by all those that know me. They have no idea I’m physically dependent on pure fentanyl. 



All I’d have to do is double my daily shot, and that’s it. Now there’s a fucking legal chem available with confirmed equipotency available too. So of course I snagged that one. Lasts longer than fent, but isn’t the same for me. More expensive too. 


Idk the point of this at all. Sorry if I’m breaking rules. It’s just that nobody has any idea about this but me. Thanks for reading."
3645,what’s the point of living if this is the life i’m living in,sorry just had to get that out there
3646,Every day I have thoughts of wanting to die because I know nobody would care,"My whole family is a mess, I have no actual friends, every time I try making new friends and doing things with them I’m the odd one out and don’t fit in and I give up. My whole family fights and is miserable and toxic. I have no true, genuine friends where I live. I feel like a joke to everybody and I can’t even be myself without feeling the pressure of society to be someone else that I’m not. I feel like when people say they care they’re just lying and couldn’t give two shits less about me. I literally feel like I could die and nobody in my life that knows me would even care, deadass. It’ll be the same thing of mourning for a couple days and then they move on and it doesn’t affect anything. My heart sinks every time I think about it but I think of it literally everyday. I just woke up an hour ago and this was my first thought from waking up. Shit really hurts"
3647,Last Hope,"Last year i told myself that 2019 is going to be different but unfortunately it was not, and it was somehow worse and i also gave myself just this year to get my life together otherwise there is no other option but suicide and i am really considering it right now,i keep telling myself that it's not gonna solve anything but who am i kidding 2020 is just gonna be the same shit all over again. So, i wanna say if this is my last post ever(throwaway account) that i tried..."
3648,I'm having a good day.,"Not been out just watched a few videos. My delivery from Tescos arrived and I made pumpkin soup and had some Garlic bread. I even laughed at a scene from airplane. So to paraphrase worf:""perhaps today is a good day to die"".
I have my suicide kit ready and I am just plucking up courage to use it, so let's hope today is the day."
3649,I'm tired,"I can't keep doing this, I can't keep doing this I can't keep fucking fighting. I'm tired. I'm done. 

I will not keep doing this. I'm done. I was right. I'm not doing this. Fuck off. I'm done. I'm done."
3650,Do you ever feel sad knowing when someone who wanted to live died but you would have gladly taken their place,
3651,"Kind of sick of people telling me to ""do what I love""","Anyone else so apathetic they can't enjoy anything? I mean, why the fuck else would we feel this way!!?!?? FUUUUUUUUUCK."
3652,It's the kindest thing I can do for this world.,"My entire life I've been surrounded by violence, lies and manipulation. When you can't escape it at home or at school, it gets bred into ya. I've lashed out a lot and I've pushed a lot of people away because I'm toxic. I'm good for 2 things, violence and survival. But somehow I ended up prioritising the survival of the pack over survival of myself and even though I've experienced a lot of pain and violence I still don't hate others and I don't actively want to hurt people. But at the same time the more my life goes on the more and more I'm confronted by people that would go an harm others because it makes them feel better because they like throwing their weight around. That's something I don't do. I'd rather bring out the best in those around me but when people don't want you to bring out the best in yourself then there's a problem. They wanna take a swing at me, fine the first one is free. They never take that second swing because they know what's coming. But I'm so fucking sick of Violence in places that are meant to be safe and peaceful. 

I'm sick of being a slave to minimum wage which i have been for the past 5 fucking years; bled for rent, and I mean if it smells like shit everywhere I go then it's probably me but if everyone else is saying it's not me then I have no fucking clue. 

And I' angry about it. Angry that people who lie, manipulate, bully and steal get ahead in life where as the people who value peace get left behind. Unfortunately someone like me is built for war, and I'm even too fucked up for somewhere like the military and I'm smart enough to stay out of prison. So when I say I'm torn between killing others and inflicting pain,  Creating a Riot and killing myself you've gotta understand. I'm pretty far gone. I have one thing that sort of kept me going but having to eat; therfore having to work, therefore having a body that is constantly in pain and have no freetime are reality. 

I'm a disapointment to my family. But that's nothing new, I've always been a waste of space, good for nothing. I was never allowed any freedoms growing up. Mum even told me on multiple occaision,s that she regretted not having the abortion. 

So yeah, noone wants anything to do with me and I don't want much to do anyone because anyone who wants to be my friend is lieing and trying to hustle me/take advantage of me. Don't get me wrong I'd like to procreate, have a family. Wife and some beautiful kids but I'm afraid that I might lash out at somepoint, and I especially absolutely wouldn't want to hurt a hypothetical family.  
The cycle has gotta end with me. So if I kill myself; I can't hurt anyone else. I can't hurt a family I don't have, I can't be assaulted at work, I can't go blow up cars and buildings, I can't loot and petrol bomb shops and police cars in a riot. 

So if I die, it's better for everyone."
3653,Things to do before my suicide,"So, you see, I had some friends and one person among them that I really really loved. I still do. But he doesn't love me back anymore, he doesn't want even to talk with me anymore... So all these friends don't want either. I have literally no one right now, even to talk to. Everybody fucking hates me, literally everybody. The way they threat me now, the way they're looking at  me. They do hate me. And I hate myself the most. It's been few weeks since I lost everyone and everything is still so fucking painful. I surely don't wanna live anymore. I don't have a reason to. When I had friends we used to play computer games everyday, I was also drawing really often. These were the only things I enjoyed doing. But since these few weeks everyday looks the same. I cry for few hours, take sleeping pills, sleep for few hours, wake up, cry again and again and again, take sleeping pills. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Nothing at all. I'm not able to live anymore, so I'm just trying to sleep as often as I can. But even sleeping is painful - I have nightmares. Everyday. All these people are in them... They escaped from me but I'm the only one who can't escape from myself. I decided - I need to die. I already chose the perfect day. But I need to survive few another weeks then.

I have nothing and no one to lose anymore. I can do literally everything right now, because soon I won't be here after all. Do you have any ideas what I can do before killing myself? 

I've thought about some trips, to the places I liked or wanted to visit before I lost all interest in everything. I'll do few piercings I've always wanted to have (I wonder if they can make me be able to look at myself in the mirror). If I'll have an occasion, I tell some people what I really think. But how about some unwonted things? Do you have any ideas? I don't care if it'll be something weird, creepy, dangerous, shaming or whatever, I don't care about anything, but I don't want to just die - I wanna start really living for a short while."
3654,I can’t stop crying,WHY WONT ANYONECHELP ME???? I need help so bad
3655,Im going to fucking kill myself,"Im at the lowest point in my life, i used to be at my best last year, i used to be soo happy but now nothing is going right for me, all my friends, who i did way better than last year are beating me while im sitting here in the failure, im going to fucking kill myself i swear"
3656,Telling a parent?,"I don't know if it's a good idea or not. 

I've been really struggling these last couple days.

It seems my dad can see it now, always asking me if I'm fine (he never does that), telling me I look pale and stuff.

Everytime I obviously say I'm fine but I've been thinking of maybe saying I'm not.

I don't know what he would think of it, I'm not very close to my dad. I feel like he hates me sometimes but now he's all over me."
3657,I hate it here,I don't want to be here anymore. Existence is painful.
3658,I've gotten to the point where even I don't even care that my loved ones beg me not to feel this way.,"I have no patience to see it ""get better"". Yet I'm too much of a pussy to actually do it. 

My friends and family cry at the thought of me dying. But the pain is too much. It sucks to see them hurt. But I always tell them not to blame themselves.

I just feel like....I don't even care anymore! Alright... I'm still in too much pain. 

I ruined my life! I don't know what to do. I love my friends and family so much but the pain is destroying me. I don't know what to do. Someone give me the magic button that fixes everything. 

Does ANYONE feel this way? I can't actually go through with it right now."
3659,I lost my job because of my own stupidity,I started working in a hotel. It was an easy enough job. One of the guests seduced me. I'm just that depraved of female attention that I swallowed the hook right up. Needless to say she broke my heart. I don't know what I was expecting. I told my family I am having a great time with her. But I am alone sitting in the train crying. I can't face going back into the hotel. I can't the humiliation. I set myself up for failure because of my own naivete. I think this is what is going to drive me to kill myself. I will see you in the next life. If I live I'll reply within 24h
3660,Physical appearance influences your personality,"Just something I've been thinking about recently and this [article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201709/the-powerful-link-between-appearance-and-personality) i came across shows that it possibly holds water. How fucked is that? The way our stupid fucking flesh happens to lay on top of the shape of our skull influences what kind of person you turn out to be. Who the fuck designed this shit? If god is really that shallow then he's worse than human. This is so absolutely vile that it's gonna keep me awake whenever it is the next time I try and sleep. 

How can reality be so unforgiving for no fucking reason at all? I'd rather off myself than live among people that are ignorant to their own evil. Humans are fucking evil man, on purpose or not. It doesn't matter. I don't identify with or accept this ape bullshit one bit. Hard pass for me if things really are as shallow as they always seem. And yes, it's been shown to me time and time again that people are fundamentally shallow. This is just extra diarrhea-icing on the festering shitcake that is humanity.

No one gives a shit about who you ""want"" to be. You are what the fucking world and the disgusting monkies that live there decide you are. Hmmm you look like an incompetent, untrustworthy fuck, so you know what? You are now. Simply because *you were treated like you are*. And you'll be none the wiser. As far as you know, and the people around you are concerned, you're just naturally supposed to be a piece of shit! Jesus christ it's like some bad dystopian novel

Fuck all of you. Imma head out soon. Reeeeally soon. I'm over it. Fuck everything. It's just disheartening piece of information after disheartening piece of information. There truly is no end to life's unfairness. 23 btw still thinks like a middle schooler btw cringe btw iamverysmart btw. I will never be happy in a world like this. I'll never accept it. I'd rather die than accept it. No wonder I have no energy to do anything when I live in a world that doesn't want me. News flash I didn't ask to be born and I don't fucking want you either. My self-worth is so far off into the negative that a single article that hits juuust the right spot can destroy any shred of positivity i might've temporarily had. Just die already shiteater."
3661,I wish 'reaching out' was as easy as people say it is.,"Because it's not, I don't want to put a burden on my friends, I don't want to force them to take care of me, struggle to think of what to say to make me feel better. I've pushed all of my friends away so I can't just randomly message them ""hi I'm really suicidal"" so I continue to write suicide notes every night and cry myself to sleep listening to Frank Ocean just to repeat the next day."
3662,HI THERE. HOPE AT LEAST THREE OF YOU KILL YOURSELVES TODAY,"STOP BEING FUCKING FAGGOTS AND PUSSIES AND DO IT. GRAB THOSE PILLS, PULL THAT TRIGGER, MAKE THAT ROPE TIGHT!!! YOU GOT THIS.

3663,"I want to kill myself, because I deserve that.","(20F). 
I’m not a good person. I’ve done my share of bad deeds, hurt people. I’ve also been hurt. Physically, mentally, emotionally, sexually abused. But Im not defending myself. Im a horrible person who has hurt and betrayed someone who loved me. Maybe I deserved all that. I just want to kill myself. I keep getting thoughts that I should kill myself. But Im not actively doing anything about it. I just imagine myself doing it. I know people wont miss me. I dont think I’ve touched that many lives in that way. Something tells me that they’ll get used to my absence. All the memories of abuse keeps coming back.. all the rude things they used to tell me. Maybe its true. Im a horrible person who must die. The world does not need more bad people. I just wish I had it in me to end it all"
3664,I don't want to live but I don't want to make my parents sad,"I've lost my interest in living since I entered high school and ever since I can't bring myself to find any satisfaction in my life. And it's not that my life is super bad or anything. I have loving parents that may be a little bit hypereligious but that's neither here or there. I have friends. I have good grades. 
Yet, I still feel like I want to die. I hate myself. I'm ugly, even though I started to eat healthy to stop my acne I still can't get rid of it. Everytime I look in the mirror and feel resentment and hate. I tried to date someone but it ended in this person showing little to no initiative in the relationship and that made me hate myself even more. Now I found out that my crush likes someone else, someone way more handsome and athletic than me. I was never a sports person but I try to keep myself healthy through normal exercise. And it's always like that, I develop a crush on someone, I try to approach that person, I befriend her and then I find out she has a crush on someone else. It's getting comical at this point. My friends say that having a gf is not that good and then they give examples of how their gfs get jealous or shop too much, but I don't care about things like that. I want to love and be loved, that's all. Everytime I tried I got either immediately rejected or ghosted in the first month. It's not even about sex either, I just want to have someone I can cuddle with and give affection. 
I'm starting to believe that I will never find love. I'm just too ugly and weak to be worth anything in anyones eyes. In the future I'll probably end up doing some boring ass desk job and live alone to the day I'll die and I don't want to end up like that. I would rather end myself right now, but that would break my parents' heart. They love me so much and I love them too."
3665,"Tldr money can’t buy happiness, small dicks ruin lives","Waisted my life
I grew up middle class, average childhood in the suburbs. My family’s business success brought them success but also blessed them with a high intake of cocaine on top with drinking day. Apparently high functioning alcoholics are ok. 

As soon as i got to middle school, and i first had sex,  realized my dick really isn’t that big. 3.5” fml

Just always tore up my ego. 
I have no sex drive, no confidence. 
my coworkers think I’m scared with women but surprisingly I’m not. But what’s the point of talking to a woman when she’s not going to be satisfied.

Every girl i was ever with, had an issue or another with my size. 9 to be exact. 

I’m tired of disappointing women. 
“That Shit Fucking hurts.” 

Parents drug use is out of control. Moms always cracked out. Dad starts drinking at 10 am. Work quality is piss poor now at the company he built up.

My little sister doesn’t need to grow up with this. 
Our family is extremely small and extremely  bitchy. No one is in contact at all with each other. 

While i work my ass off in the family’s buisness, all the employees see my parents downfall. It’s depressing and everyone just shrugs when L &amp; a would do something crack head  

I’m not good at anything out side of work.  I don’t have any skills, talents hobbies or any special abilitys. 

I’ve spent the last 4 years working while everyone else is in college. 
Ive had tinder for the last year. It was cool, got some hook ups, has some potential date worthy girls. Nothing special.

Gave up on dating but checked tinder and i manched and talked to this girl. Personality’s just click. Same type of parents as i do too, so she knows my pain. 
We talk on the phone for hours every night for 3 weeks 

First girl I’ve ever fell this hard for. 
I’ve been with 8 woman, I’ve felt feelings before, but this woman is something special. 

When we finally could meet for the first time, and it was amazing. Im falling in love. This girl proved that love exists. She’s sweet, super sarcastic sense of humor, goofy as hell. I thought about her 24/7. 

After another date we end up sleeping together. 
She was not enjoying my size. 
I got so embarrassed that i was losing my boner. I’m now trying do my best with a limp member. 

Fucking hell. 
Awkward ass ride home. 
Her stepdad met us at the front door to drop her off. She’s being awkward  with the stepdad and then rushed into the house and said i Can leave. 

I’m 22 years old. Can’t make a woman happy, is working for his coked out drunk parents, and don’t have friends. I truly tried my best in this life.  What else can i do. 

Fuck."

3667,What happens when you’re in a mental hospital,
3668,"I am crying non stop, I'm thinking of suicide nonstop someone help me please","I can't do this anymore. I keep crying every fucking day not letting go of the past. I am alone and will probably keep being a fucking pussy all my life. I cant overcome my trauma. I wish someone would just give me some support or anything. I dont want to live like this all my fucking life but I want to end my pain. seeing a therapist is not helping me and Im scared on what to do here forward. help me please, im literally begging for someone to write to me or comfort me."
3669,My plan is set and I know what to do,"Just ordered a rope, have a place I know where I can put it, now I just have to wait. I have to wait just under 2 months to optimize my chances of not getting caught and put in a mental facility where they put me on antidepressants which will lie to me about my situation. Nothing you gamers say will change my mind at this point as i'm far past the point of sadness. Finna be with you gamers for a bit longer but my plan is set in stone. Fuck this trash ass world, fuck the flying sky man, and fuck being me. 🦀🦀🦀"
3670,I'm so fucking tired,"Usually when I visit my dad's place it helps with my bad thoughts because I can just relax, even spend the whole day in my room if I want to without anyone bothering me. It doesn't seem to be doing much good this time.


I even posted on here two days ago and a couple of amazing strangers took the time to talk to me, listen to me ramble and distract me. It honestly helped a bunch.


But now I'm back in the rut, and I'm so fucking tired. I can't just go to my room because my sister is celebrating her birthday with some relatives and dear god, dealing with these people is so exhausting. So many questions about school, about how I'm doing without actually wanting to hear the truth. Not to mention having to see my family play all buddy-buddy with laughs and smiles, but as soon as they're apart, the gossiping and talking behind each others' backs about how horrible they are starts and trying to pit me against them and I am so. Fucking. Tired of having to deal with their shit. Is a non-dysfunctional, caring, helping family really too much to ask for?


I just want to lock myself into my room and wash down all those pills with wine."
3671,I feel like I’m not supposed to be here,"I don’t fit in anywhere. Friends, family, work. 

When I try to reach out to family to tell them how I feel they tell me I’m too negative. And they’re excluding me from things because of my “negative” attitude."
3672,What a joke...,"he suicide prevention hotline is a joke. Idk if I'm calling the wrong one or what, but I've tried their text link, their phone number. I've never actually managed to talk to someone. I've been waiting for an hour to just vent to someone and all it's done is made me more disgusted with myself and feeling more isolated and alone. I don't know how much longer I can take feeling like there's no one out there to throw me a life line. All I did last night after giving up trying to talk to someone was come up with ways to kill myself. I don't even know why I'm here right now."
3673,Don't care if I make people upset,I don't care if I make people upset if I'll kill myself or not especially my mum. I know that it would devastate her but at this point I just can't bring myself to care. Also the last time I attempted she screamed at me some how made herself look like the victim and me the bad guy all whilst insulting me calling me selfish. People didn't care about me when I was alive so it won't make much of a difference me being dead
3674,i feel so empty inside,life is meaningless. i feel like i got an ocean of tears inside me but i can't let em out.
3675,"Having chest pain while we are depressed, is it normal ?","I always have this feeling like someone is stabbing me right through heart , crushing it . It hurts , it hurts damn so much , I feel like stabbing myself and get relived from this pain"
3676,i feel guilty for even thinking about it,"i know anyone can have depression, and suicidal thoughts don’t pick and choose people. just because other people have it worse doesn’t mean your sadness isn’t valid.

but i can’t help but feel absolutely awful about how i feel. every day i want to die. the thought of continuing on is exhausting.

the only reason i don’t just end it all (aside from the fact that i’m a coward) is because i could not do that to my family. i have the kindest parents and i know it would just crush them if they even knew i have these types of thoughts.

i used to self-harm in high school and when my mom found out, she was so devastated and worried and thought she did something wrong, like she wasn’t being a good enough, supportive enough mother or something (but she was. it had nothing to do with her. i just get sad for no reason idek what goes on with me). i promised her i’d stop. and i did. for her. i relapsed a year ago after being clean for three years. she doesn’t know. but i stopped again. it’s been almost a year this time.

another reason i feel guilty is because my sister has had a much tougher life than me. she has been through a lot and she’s still marching on. i know how difficult her life is and how hard she tries to stay positive. i cant throw my relatively easier life away while she’s staying strong. and i cant make things harder for her. i cant make her lose her sister.

i cant make my parents lose their daughter. my life may mean little to nothing to me, but it means something to them. i cant hurt them like that. they already worry so much about me because i live far from home. i cant add to their troubles.

but like i said, the very thought of continuing is exhausting.

this has gotten longer than i meant for it to get.,,.and i don’t really know what i’m hoping to gain by posting this. but i just needed to vent i guess."
3677,"I ""practiced"" killing myself (venting)","TRIGGER WARNING: suicidal plans, attempts to kill myself, belt, neck, suffocation
---------
DISCLAIMER: not trying to obtain attention or ""please don't do it"" speechs


Last night, I practiced the method that would be the best to perform... Which was: suffocation through a belt.

I was only practicing... It wasn't to kill myself. I have letters to write and things to do before I actually do it. But... It didn't go as I intended...

I placed the belt around my neck and closed it as hard as I could but I could still breathe. The only effect I got was neck pain and feeling like I was going to ""pop"" my head (it was cutting the blood flow).

I thought the problem was due to the belt being too big in width so I tried with my own hands in several points of my neck to see if the width was the problem but I only got the same effect - I could still breathe normally but my blood flow was getting cut-off.

Now, I understand why is it so hard to kill by suffocation... Maybe I have to try other method."
3678,15% of sufferers suicide. Here’s to being a statistic,"I (35f)have a condition called Pre Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder and every month I battle extreme mood swings resulting from an intolerance to my own god damn hormones.
For a week before my period I cry uncontrollably for days on end, I’m angry for no reason and I’m just so, so sad. Then my cycle continues, hormones equalise and life is lovely again. Research indicates it gets worse with age. Yay. 
Until recently the lovely part of life has been enough to keep my going. That and my delightful parents. 
However, after another failed long term relationship with someone who I thought would be my forever, I just can’t do it anymore. 
I’m destined to never have children and that on its own is increasingly hard to cope with. I’ve gone back to study to be a school teacher but having serious doubts about my ability to be successful. I feel like a failure in almost every aspect of my life. 
I’m barely hanging in there and only for my mother, it would destroy her and she’d feel like she failed me. It’s dreadfully tragic that I’m awaiting the death of my parents so I can die too.
I’m trying so hard to give them one last Christmas, I just don’t know if I will."
3679,i’m scared,"i’m scared i’m gonna lose the one thing i had left of me, i’m scared rhe one person i had left is gonna leave me and its gonna be all my fault. i don’t have anyone except for them, i can’t bare the sound of silence anymore, everything’s become way too much for me to handle i cant do it anymore

nothings worth i just want to die nothing changes in life

it’s all the same process over and over, i meet someone, they like me, and then they leave me when they find out just how much of  shit person i am. i don’t have my parents, i don’t have my brother, i have one friend that barely talks to me.

i’m scared i’m gonna lose myself next."

I want to shut down and not go through this again.. even if there’re positives outta of it cuz I know that happiness is momentarily and I’ll get to deal

They say light and darkness comes in cycles and if it’s dark now, light will come soon. I say fuck it! 
The default is darkness, and the sun only orbs the infinite abyss.
The default is fucking misery, and happiness is just a fuckin visitor that comes and goes.
I’m just super dark now and I’m tired of all of those positive, all-the-time happy people.

I feel broken down and fucking worthless and it never seems to get better. I don’t want to hurt my friends and family, but this shit just keeps hurting more and more."
3686,Life is a death sentence!,"Life is a prison and we are all sentenced to death. When our parents give birth to us they literally force us to go through years of stress to die at the end as if we never existed, but the majority of us don't want to admit it because they are afraid of the reality and because their survival instinct forces them to convince themselves that they exist in this world for a reason and that they have to keep living.
Life is pointless, meaningless and unjust.. And nobody should have to go through years of stress, anger and sicknesses just because of some selfish people aka our parents."
3687,"ur time is valuable, I appreciate whatever amount u spend to read this.","im 19, my life really isn't the worst right now, it's been bad, it's been good, but when i lay in bed at night I always conclude that i am not happy, and believe I never will be, my parents have recently split up. our family due to past events is split into many small groups. mine being my mam and my younger sister, I help my mam out with money when i can, she needs help, I don't mind helping. i know she needs me to help her in this time and i dont want to leave her alone. however I have a lot of hate for myself, enough for me to be mad at myself for being able to live around good people. if one small negative thing happens , or a slight inconvience, my mind falls and i frantically plan for a soon to happen suicide, last night i was out with my girlfriend and 2 friends, I sobered up after an hour, anxiety kicked in, and i couldn't enjoy dancing while sober around that many ppl, and i hated myself for not being able to enjoy it, anyway i stated thinking to myself. ""i need to leave i need to walk away, I gotta msg that guy he knows people with drugs he can ask around for some lethal shit maybe some thing with fentynal' and i thought about this for an hour going through my head, can i od in my room, my mam will have to walk in to it, outside with no one around eventually my body will be found. and i thought about how recently I haven't made ppl as happy as I used to, my gf goes to uni she has friends they hang out outside of uni, she doesn't need me to stay happy. and i cant be happy knowing that. i never wanted to be the person that's like 'oh I'm deppressed, oh yea im suicidal' but maybe there is something wrong and maybe someone can help. anyway idk where this was going but i had two ways to let this all out how I'm feeling , trapped in my own hate and missery, unable to leave bcs of the inconvenience it might be to another life. i had to either post this here right now, and let somebody know, or message the guy I know, and find my way to an od. 
I realise this is excessively long, thank u if u read."
3688,Is feeling suicidal an excuse to go home from school?,
3689,I'm coming to the end of my road soon,"I've only made one other post in another subreddit on this account because I don't want to risk anything getting back to the people involved in it or anyone I know and still don't want that to happen. I apologize for the incoming massive wall of text but I need to include as many relevant details as possible so that hopefully you can better understand where I am currently and how I got there, both physically and mentally.

TLDR version of that post is I became friends with someone who is in a relationship. Over time we become good friends. Over time I develope a crush on her but never act on it because first and foremost I don't want to do anything to mess with her relationship with her fiance, secondly I don't want to ruin our friendship, and thirdly at the time I was fine with just being friends because we were still kind of getting to know each other. She invites me to her wedding because she considers me a good friend, say I'm gonna go because that sounds fun. Late one night she messages me and she's breaks down and tell me a bunch of different stuff, mostly about how she feels like her relationship is failing, in the end I give her some advice because she was going through some things that were similar to my parents relationship before they divorced, advice works. I've been dealing with issues for a while and haven't told anyone at all about them, I'm about to leave my house to kill myself when she messages me really casually at first, then follows up saying she was concerned about me because I seemed down and I break down and tell her about literally everything that has been fucking with my head for a long time, she basically talks to me about a bunch of the shit she's been through and it turns out on top of us having a lot of good, normal things in common she's been through a lot of the same negative shit I have been and we're basically the same person, she hasn't told anyone including her fiance about some of the things she tell me. She talks me down from suicide. A few weeks later I message her because I'm concerned a out her, she was about to kill herself, end up talking her down. My stupid ass falls in love with her after all of this but I still haven't acted on my feelings.

I was living with my parents, my mom is disabled and my stepdad works away from home for months at a time. We live in a small town where it's literally impossible for me to find work and I'm failing in college. I told my mom I was planning on going to my friends wedding and she freaked out and told me if I do to find somewhere else to live, I'll go into greater detail about this if someone wants me to but I'd rather not, this greatly affected my decision to leave because I literally owe my friend my life and I don't want to miss her wedding. One of my other friends who still lives with his parents was in a similar situation a while ago gets permission from his parents for me to move in with them. Out of pure desperation I take them up on their offer, pack as many of my things as I can fit in a backpack and move halfway across the country unannounced. A week prior to this my mom was in a car accident and I took care of her until my stepdad could come home to take over and help her adjust to me being gone. When I get to where I am now I contact my parent's, they're shocked and confused but kinda happy for me because they were worried about me for a while. Since then things have been awkward between us, I don't think they're intentionally trying to guilt trip me but it's still been happening nonetheless. My friend amd his parents have spent an unknown amount of money on me so far helping me get my shit together and help me establish a life, I feel really bad about this because I personally don't believe I'm worth it. I don't tell my friend this because I don't want him to think I'm ungrateful because I'm not, if they hadn't opened their home to me I would have probably killed myself.

Now, back on the subject of who I consider my best friend that I've fallen in love with despite my best efforts. We've gotten even closer since my first and only post up until this point but i still haven't confessed my feelings for her. I still haven't told her how I feel for a multitude of reasons. Most importantly I respect her relationship with her soon to be husband too much for me to even risk destroying her happiness, more on why I feel that might even be a remote possibility later. Secondly I don't want to destroy my friendship with her or make things awkward because I'm still trying to kill my feelings and just stay friends with her. Thirdly even if she does feel the same way about me as I do about her, I know I'm not good enough for her, before anyone say anything, no she hasn't done anything to make me feel this way I feel like this on my own. While I do still think I would probably be better for her emotionally because we have a lot of shared experiences and trauma, in literally every other way I know I can't compare to her fiance and with how much of an emotional trainwreck I am I'd be scared I would fuck up and fail her, and she deserves better than that. 

Part of me thinks that she might have more than friendly feelings for me because of some things she's said to me and just generally how she acts and sounds when we talk. Not too long ago she randomly sent me a string of messages to me after we said goodnight basically saying I matter to someone, I have a reason to live and meaning in life, I'm too hard on myself, and that I'm one of the most important people in her life. She's told me things she hasn't told literally anyone else and she seems to trust me more than anyone. I make her legitimately laugh and when she's feeling down I always seem to find a way to make her laugh and be happy again and she has the same affect on me and I've let her know she does.

I'm going to her wedding soon as a last ditch effort to kill my feelings for her so that I can be happy with just being friends with her. Even if I can kill my feelings I'm not sure I want to live anymore. I've been suffering with so much mental shit for so long and it just seems to be getting progressively worse, unless if I can find someone just like her that I can be that emotionally intimate with, and can actually love me back I don't think I can ever even begin to fix myself but at the same time I need to fix myself because I feel it isn't fair for me to put my personal shit off on anyone I care about.

 I hate myself more than I can even begin to put into words but I'll try. I hate myself because I've hurt my parents. I feel like I'm taking advantage of my friend and his parents that have so graciously opened their home to me. I feel like a piece of shit for letting myself get so close to someone who is already taken and for allowing myself to develop the feelings that I have for her. I hate myself for letting her be as intimate with me as she has been because I feel like I've done something wrong because I think she should only be on that level with her fiance but she clearly needed someone so I doubt myself and whether or not I've done anything wrong where this is concerned. I feel like I've done nothing but fail and disappoint the people who care about me as well as myself all of my life and I've just been doing it more the older I get. My mind tortures me with all of these thoughts and I just want to blow my brains out to get away from them. I don't know who I am and haven't know for such a long time. I look in the mirror and all I see is a disgusting, self loathing, hollow shell of a man with nothing to live for, devoid of spirit of meaning.

I love her more than I can put into words. Before I met her I never believed in ""the one"" but I do now. She has helped me overcome alcoholism and has literally saved my life and that is a debt I can never repay no matter how much I try. I know that if/when I do kill myself it would hurt her a lot and that's one of the only things keeping me from doing it.

I'm just so tired. I'm tired of waking up and wishing I hadn't. I'm tired of the constant negative thoughts that fill my head. I'm tired of pretending I'm ok and faking smiles to convince those around me that I'm fine when inside I just want it all to be over. I'm tired of keeping everything inside because I literally can't let it out.

I apologize if I made any spelling, punctuation, grammar mistakes, or broke any rules. I've been averaging 4 hours of sleep for a long time now and it's taking it's toll on me, and I'm on mobile. I'm sorry this is so long and may be a bit rambley but it's hard for me to form coherent thoughts and keep them for very long. I just feel like I'm at the end of my road and I don't know where else to turn. I'm sorry if I cause anyone any concern, I just need someone to talk to."

A new house! Yes! Fina- *dink*. A big stone... Can I move?

A late essay. Under the word count. *Dink*. That was a big stone. 

A mistake at work. Big consequences. *DInk*

I love him so much and I stay here for him and I try my hardest. I’m just scared, scared of how much longer I have left and scared of the kind of life he will have if I leave him behind which I never thought I was capable of but I am really struggling.

After my father’s “death” it was more like suicide , I saw how him just escaped so many problems and now I want to follow him , to be free and careless about life .

He keeps saying that he can’t ever do things he wants because of all of my bills he has to pay on. I feel like I’m such a burden, I feel like I weigh so much on him. And then I have a few mental illnesses that I go to therapy and take meds for that just adds to it and I worry that I’ll never be truly better and I’ll end up being a burden to my kids.

I can’t function in a lot of settings and I had to drop out of school because of it. I don’t know how I’m going to keep up with this and I’m starting to consider suicide as an option more and more.

3700,Got drunk and self harmed,Just what the title says. Contemplated downing an entire packet of sleeping pills too. Stuck in bed with a stinging arm.
3701,I feel like my life doesn't worth to try harder,"First, I want to thank the one who created this thread. I'm not sure if it'll be helpful but writing a bit does help.

I'm only sixteen but I feel like my life is worse every new month. About two years ago my right hip started to hurt me for no reason. It was not something really important at first but in a few months the thing became so painful that I couldn't walk more that 10 minutes without feeling like a knife was in my leg, I couldn't stand up more than 30 seconds without it hurting and about a year later, I'm not even capable of sitting without being in pain. Me and my mother spent months to try to find what may have caused the pain. We tried every test possible and they were all negative. Even my region specialist wasn't able to find anything. We think the cause might be psychologic but we really have no clue.

I've been out of school for now 6 months. Almost everyday I just stay in bed, reading, staying on my phone or playing video games. Everyday feels long, way too long. I try my best to go out in city one day per week but ... Feeling pleasure for a day and a day of pure pain the day after that is a lot to bear. My parents always tell me that I spend too much time on my phone, that I don't help enough in the house ... I can't just spend all my money on books just so that they're proud of me !! I just need something to do so I don't become crazy staring at the ceiling. I feel bad for not helping to do anything in my house but what can I do ?! Each time I'm told that ""I'm pretending to be in pain just to do nothing"" it breaks me even more. 

I'm starting to wish I had cancer, because if I had it I would know that I'm sick for real and that I can be cured. Right now I just feel hopeless. I've lost contact with all my friends and I don't hang out with anybody. I feel alone. And as an autistic person it's really hard for me to go to new people and just start talking. Even by internet it just really hard. So I'm in the worst part of my life and nobody is here to support me. 

And even after that I'm just too afraid to be an adult. I want to be an artist. It's litterally the only thing that I want to do but everyone is just telling me that I will live an horrible life and that I'll probably never get a job. And seriously, working retail is really not an option. I'm reacting really badly about being in a group to work (even if it's with people I love), I can't move properly with my hip, I'm stupidly clumsy and I forget a  lot of things. So I'm just ... Stuck.

I have a few reasons for why I didn't commit suicide. I'm too afraid it'll hurt ot that if I fail depending on the method I used I might be even more handicaped. I know my familly cares about be and I think of them everytime I want to do it. They all had high hopes for me and I just feel like I need at least to survive. My grandfather died a few weeks ago and the last thing he wanted to told me is that he was proud of me and knew I would be able to do incredible things. I loved him with all my heart and went to his funerals even if it meant being in pain for days. I want to make him proud but I feel stuck in my body like it will last forever. It's horrible. The final thing that keeps me alive is the fact that after almost 14 years of asking for an animal, I finally was able to get praying mantises. They're the little things that help me feel good every morning and I love them. If I die, nobody will know how to take care of them and dying of starvation is too horrible for theses babies. 

So yeah, that's it. I'm just feeling horrible everyday and I'm trying my best to find things that keep me alive. Oh also, english isn't my main language (I'm french) so I'm sorry if some of my writing was shitty."
3702,Here we go again...,"On Christmas Day, last year, I had a failed suicide attempt. 

With almost a year of therapy and attempts at recovery. I feel I've gotten nowhere. 

Those of us with depression, all have our stories of worthlessness and lack of self value. I won't waste space with the long list of events leading to where I'm at.  

Simply put...  I'm 31.  I'm alone. No friends. Poor with insurmountable debt. 

I had found happiness for a few solid years. And then the one person I had invested all of myself into, left me. 

I know breakups are hard and happen to everyone but this felt more like having a winning lottery ticket and throwing it away.. She was perfect..  I screwed it up and I know I'll never find someone like her again. 

A year later and I'm not even close to over it. With that compiled on top of everything else, I go to bed every night wishing I won't wake up. 

Therapy, counseling, medication, etc. Nothing has helped. 

I think about however many years I have left in life, and it terrifies me.. 

How many nights sleeping alone that will be... How many unpaid bills and day's going hungry are ahead of me.. 

Sure, there's plenty of stories of people who didn't figure it out until their thirties but I just don't see it happening.. not even close. 

Idk why I'm here...what I'm expecting... I just don't know anymore. 

I have grown so very tired of being tired. Are some of us just genetically designed in a way that makes us incapable of living in this world today? 

I've always felt like a failure. And then failing at ending it just made that feeling even worse. 

And I think the only thing keeping me alive is the belief that I will just fail at it again..."
3703,This.,"I feel so dead and empty inside and I’ve tried brushing it off, getting “past” it, I mean...I’ve tried before (kinda a bitch-ass attention attempt...this is much different), and is it so pathetic that I’m afraid more of not succeeding and ending up in a fuckin lock down psych ward again? That’s worse than death to me. I just feel like I seem to have been the common denominator in everyone that I love and care abouts misery and I’m too soft-hearted to take that in and not care about what I’m doing to them. I’d rather just excuse myself of life since physically relocating whether it be state to state or even room to fucking room, doesn’t matter. I still hurt the people I care about most. I don’t wanna be someone who lives in the past although I always do...only in comparison of the amazing person I used to be instead of this worthless disgusting loser that no one wants to deal with or love anymore. I’m not an idiot...I know what’s going on around me and my intuition is pretty much always on point. I can usually tell when someone’s done-zo with me. Or maybe not....since the last and most painful blow was the family I’ve loved more than anything for almost two decades just dropped me. Without personal explanation. Just let someone else, who I barely know, tear into my soul and who I am as a person....I can’t get over this hurt. I always said the shit you go thru makes you stronger and I think a lotta things I went thru did, but not anymore. I’m weak, worthless, disliked, unloved, unwanted trash. Why should I care anymore than the people I regard in the highest form? I don’t. I was already my own worst critic. Now I’m just...nothing. I am so sorry to the people that I have said bad things to in the past, I have been out of line so many times and I will acknowledge and admit my immature and emotionally-driven mistakes. I am beyond regretful and apologetic in the most sincere way for ever hurting anyone, which tended to always be the people I truly love the most. There’s no blame towards anyone here, only myself. I let myself become this empty shell. I’m sorry. I love you."
3704,I’m tired of this shit.,"I’m only 15 and I don’t care about my future anymore. I’m doing bad in school because I’ve been so slow lately. I just want to run away from home and die, I always expected I’d be dead by then so why not get it over with sooner. A few weeks ago a girl I liked moved away and just the thought of never seeing her again is too much for me. A few days ago another girl I’m friends with but I also liked broke up with her boyfriend, I wanted to do something but If I tried to get with her or at least wait till she’s interested in me I would have felt guilty for using someones sadness to get them to like me. I’m always gonna be the lonely quiet kid no one wants to talk to. I’m always helping my friends with relationship advice, yet I can’t seem to be in one. A year ago I did something I feel very guilty for and I wish I could just go back in time to fix it. I started texting a girl I used to like, then I found out she liked me. I was hesitant, but I told her I felt the same way. She started talking about long distance relationships and I realized I shouldn’t have told her how I felt... So, I erased her from my memory and forgot about her. Till this day I want to fix it, but there is no fixing the past, there is only living with it. There can be few less scumbags like me in the world. I’d be better off dead than ruin peoples lives."
3705,I’ve done everything right... but here I am,"In the past 2 months I’ve had 2 suicide attempts. 

After the first one, I decided to reach out to my friends and family, I let them know how I was feeling, and they listened or cried. That’s all.

My second attempt was a week ago. It wasn’t completed because I wasn’t sure if I had enough time and stopped. During the attempt I had no fears or regrets, so I decided I’ll repeat this method in one week.

I told the people I was with about my attempt, my best friend and another person. They looked at me and continued their argument. I repeated what I said but they shrugged. 

Today is the day. I’ve been shredding papers, recording voice memos, uploading pictures on flash drives, and arranged for my friends to gather and meet each other 2 hours after. 

I’d like to mention, I’ve tried everything in regards to getting help. The best private mental wellness retreats in Europe, multiple shitty month long hospitalizations in the US, and a psychiatrist who I saw for a year consistently (medication included).

I think I’ve done everything I’m supposed to? Nothing worked for me and I can’t imagine how people without with the financial means or access to help survive. So strong.

Small note: I’ve really enjoyed life the past week. I’ve given many people great memories and hopefully they’ll learn a few lessons too."
3706,I trashed the rest of my depression medicine,No longer be given them like a diseased animal
3707,I tried to kill myself.,"I tried to kill myself a couple nights ago, and I have the physical damage as a reminder. I’ve been managing bipolar 2 through medication and frequent therapy. My family all knew how much of a hard time I’d been having with my depression, and I was under close supervision by my SO, psychiatrist, and therapist. 

This has been building up for so long, that one particularly bad day where my boss tore me down and humiliated me in front of the employees, and the day continued to spiral down into complete shit. I get home after a long day and my SO said one wrong thing to me, and if you can imagine a snowball sliding down a hill getting bigger and bigger then that was equivalent to my emotions. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

I stormed off to my room all while my kitten (who was meowing up a storm while all of this is going on) tried to follow me. I shut the door in his face, I didn’t want him to see what I was going to do. I harmed myself. I cried the ugliest tears you could imagine. My kitten was outside my door basically screaming and throwing his body at the door. The noise must have signaled my SO to come check on me and he caught me before I did damage that I couldn’t take back. 

I felt so relieved, and so pitiful all at once. He didn’t yell at me, even after I told him he was going to hate me. I could see how panicked he was, and in that moment I didn’t want to die. I’m glad my cat was so persistent with wanting to be with me. Without him I wouldn’t have gotten medical attention as quickly as I did. I’m still dealing with it, but it’s been a beautiful fight."
3708,Suddenly can't post here,
3709,I keep looking at my pill bottle.,"When I have bad days like today, I can't stop looking at my pill bottle. How easy it would be to swallow them and go to sleep. I'm so tired already... I know it would disappoint everyone, they would wonder where I was, probably wouldn't notice until 9 at night tomorrow when I would usually get home. My roommates don't get up until like three so no one would find me until it was too late. I already feel like a burden on everyone. My best friend can't help me. I'm so alone... I just want to sleep and not wake up."
3710,Granduation or Suicide,I've been on a high school in Germany for 3.5 years now and within these 3.5 years I was institutionalized twice because of pressure during the classes and being 42 hours in this hell hole. I went there September 2016 and started drinking and cutting daily. I needed to get out of this repetitive circle and I made myself a deal. This school better say this granduation gives me the chance to get a P.h.D. and leave my world behind. Not because a P.h.D. will heal my chronic depression but it will give me a foundation where I can build my life on away from the toxic household I live in till now. I haven't attempted suicide suicide since May 2017 and my last para suicidal behavior was Feburary 2019 since then I was more or less stable. From September till November 2018 I had my first institutionalization and my second went from September till November 2019. Now on January I will get back to school after being in home for 0.5 years. Now I don't know whether I'm stable enough to get through it. I have suicidal thoughts again. I wake up every not not merely with the thoughts of regretting to be still alive but ceasing out my existence rn. I need my granduation but I can't live with this terrible promise of either granduation or suicide anymore. I can't move out of my toxic household cause the government doesn't give a damm that my family let's me mental health deterariete rapidly. I need the structure from school but I hate this hellhole almost as much as my household. Damm I don't want to live with this dependency of a granduation for my terrible live anymore but I can't stop because if I don't depend my live on it anymore I will cry out every day to friends because I get suicidal again. I don't know what to do although I'm aware of the ridiculously of this self promise. I know I will graduate easily from the perspective of intelligence (the only thing I'm proud of is my eloquence - ignore the irony of my spelling/grammar mistakes) but I'm not stable enough to study enough for the main courses. So basically I can't use my intelligence adequately enough to graduate there. I don't know what to do and now I cry out for help here. Thank you for your time to read this and maybe even respond.
3711,"Shit just fucking repeats itself. Wake, dread, eat, bathe, work, home, sleep, dread, repeat. This Cycle just never end.",
3712,Gonna do it,"Don't know when, don't know how. But I've seen enough to make the choice. I'll figure the rest out."
3713,hi,"i feel like i have generally been doing somewhat good for the past month or so. i have been taking care of myself, it’s been easier to get out and see friends, and i have been more motivated in my studies. as someone who struggles with an eating disorder, food really hasn’t been the first thing on my mind. i haven’t been restricting my food intake or turning to food when i get stressed. i’ve just been ... normal. 

friends have commented on how much happier ive been. i have been very motivated and dedicated to getting help. im in the process of finding a therapist near me and i just (literally today) got a new antidepressant after not being on any medication in 9 months. i haven’t taken it yet, im supposed to start tomorrow morning

it is finals week, and i’ve been working on a research paper nonstop the entirety of the past week. i have pulled all-nighters at the library and sometimes not even visit my room for days at a time because i was always out studying. the due date was set for friday at 4 pm and i managed to miss it by quite literally 3 seconds. i know it was irresponsible of me to wait so long to submit it, i have heard it a million times. i know. i have been beating myself up over it for the past 24 hours. 

it just fucking sucks how no matter how well you think you’re doing one thing can come your way and fuck it all up. it’s fucking terrifying knowing that im one inconvenience or anxiety-inducing thing away from being /this/ close to killing myself. i don’t want to turn to food, i don’t want to scream or act out in anger. i feel like giving up. i have an entire week of exams ahead of me and assignments to complete by tomorrow night and im sitting in bed like a fucking pathetic piece of shit just thinking about how badly i want to kill myself. i can’t even reach out to family or friends to get my mind off of it because it’s 1am and everyone is asleep. even if it were earlier the last time i spoke to my mom she yelled at me and scolded me for being careless and missing my paper deadline. 

im making the efforts to reach out and get help, im trying my best in uni, my birthday is in a fucking week and i thought i was going to be able to say that im in a better headspace then i was last year, but im not. im still the biggest piece of shit. i came into the year wanting to die and im ending it wanting to die."
3714,"I must help my friend, but i don't know how.","He has some kind of mental illness. He sometimes looses control and he's trying to hurt himself. Then when he ""wokes up"" he doesn't remember anything. Beacuse of that he was bullied at his old school. They said ""Kill yourself it would be better for you"" or ""Only your mom would miss you"". He never had a friend before. Now in new school, he found friends, but he says he just cannot feel happy. He can't forget what happened, and thinks about it everyday. He says he don't want to die, beacuse he don't want to hurt other, but he thinks about suicide. He says he doesn't deserve help, he agrees with the kids from old school, and he's looking for a new ways of hurting himself. Thank you for reading, and please give me an advice."
3715,I feel like I'm stuck where I'm at and death is the only escape,"So yea like the title says i feel stuck cause of work,family, and some other things but i just feel like the only escape is death now I've tried talking to my family about it......like they try to understand but they don't and it's not really helpful. I just ..... Idk. Maybe venting it out on here will help,maybe not you never know, i just wish i could escape it all."
3716,I’m gonna kill myself in 2020,"I’ve made a New Years resolution early, I’m gonna hang myself sometime in 2020. I just can’t take being alone with my thoughts anymore.

I have a 3 week break between my first semester of college to my second semester coming up so I might kill myself sooner but who knows"
3717,My parents asked me to kill myself,I have always heard how if one is suffering they should reach out. So i reached out to my parents after a meltdown. Its been years since i am in depression nd suicidal nd have anxiety issues. I don't share the best relationship with my parents but some part of me still had hopes from them. Anyway yesterday i cried all day trying to explain to them my situation but they said i am lying nd i have no reason to be depressed about. My own parents told me if i am depressed then i probably want to kill myself too so y don't i do it if i really am depressed. Great solution actually. Now i might as well go ahead nd do it finally. Maybe i won't be a liar anymore...maybe i can finally find peace
3718,Real talk,If you're part of this group something or many things are making you wanna end your life.  I'm right there with you.   I dont know what u believe I dont know who you are dont know what u been through.  Heres the thing.  Say God is real and so is heaven and hell and say it's real whether u believe it or not.  Ur suffering bad right now but let's just say that perhaps hell is a real place and people that kill themselves do go there.  I know were suffering  what we cant handle right now or for a long time but honestly are u willing to roll the dice on an eternity of suffering that's a billion times worse than what u got now.   I think were at a place where we gotta start loving ourselves more than anyone we know or come acrossed.   Are u willing to roll the dice on an eternity of worse  suffering for urself and if so over what.  What could be worse than that happening to you.  Think about it cause that can be a catalyst to build off of to not end ur life and move through shit.   Let's start loving ourselves.  Nothings worth chancing our souls to a possible eternity of hell.
3719,....,"My life is shit rn, I’m lost , stuck in an endless cycle and idk how to change it. I want to quit my job n just say fuck it to life and finally end it.. had these thoughts for a majority of my life as long as I can remember.. I always have random thoughts about how I would end mylife, the details and then different ways I’d do it as well.. but idk what’s stopping me, I have so many options and easily accessible ways to do it, I feel like I have no one, the one person I could goto for everything has passed away long time ago.. idk what to do anymore, I’m stuck at the bottom"
3720,"For the first time visited therapist and talked about my childhood, even reached the point when I relived the time I wanted to end it all","Digging out all the old pain and hurt I hoped it will help me but now It hurts again... maybe I deserve it? Maybe I was born to suffer? Maybe I deserve pain, being abused, ridiculed and neglected. Maybe my hope for happiness never had a chance in the first place. I feel like the person who supposed to be near me at this time is trying get away from me as far as possible,did I just rentered that cycle again? I wish I was just never born, ending everything in the middle of the way would affect people, perhaps. But I will be finally free, won’t I?"
3721,Please hold into me just a little bit longer,"I’m 19 turning 20 this May. I tried to commit suicide when I was 16 and the second one was a few months ago. Firstly, i’m sorry if my English is not good. It is not my first language. I wanted to tell my mom and my aunt (who lives with us) about my anxiety and depression. I remember while we were having dinner, the news was about teens having depression and so on. My aunt went saying “it’s because they aren’t close to God that’s why they’re suffering like that.” My mom then added that it’s something that teens only invented. I wasn’t able to speak up.

God knows, every night before I go to bed I pray for me to get better. I cry myself up asking him for help and strength and when I was about to ask them from my family, they judged before I could even tell my story. Then a few weeks back, I finally told them. I thought they’ll change their thoughts about it but sadly they didn’t. I started to be secluded from my family. Only my older sister is the one who kept talking to me. They usually have plans to go out, I wouldn’t even know about it except when my sis talks to me about it. They’ll ask me why I eat less as if I haven’t told them about what I am feeling.

And my mom, I don’t really get her too at all. One moment she’s cursing me out, calling me names, shouting at me or hitting me with a short pole. Next moment, she’s all good as if she haven’t done those things to me. I’ve had my dreams and now it’s nowhere. In a few days, i’ll be going back to school and I am anxious as hell on how will I cope along with everybody. 

I also remember my aunt bringing me to church and asked the father to bless me saying ‘I’ve had a bad spirit on me or the devil’s cursing on me’ because of my mental state. I’ve never been more broken when I saw how they reacted and treated me after telling them the truth. They said they’ll always be there for me and listen to my problems and feelings without any judgements. I doubt that now. I just want them to at least be there when I need someone to talk to. 

I want to be better but these past days, their treatment became worse as if they’re giving up on me. I really am trying to be better. It might take a really long time but please just hold on for a little longer. I am trying, I swear. I just wanted a little more help from them to make me feel not alone. I never knew, my mother, my very own mother would have treated me worse just because of my state.

Thank you for reading, I hope everyone’s having a great day. We might be on the darkest times right now but stars and moons shines when it’s the darkest. I’d like to see the beauty that this darkness holds more. And I do hope so that you will too."
3722,I might do it,"So a little background, I just came out to my mom and she’s devastated, I can hear her sobbing in her room and I know I make her miserable because she’s told me this many times already. I feel like I’m a burden to everyone around me and I have so much crap on my mind that I just want it to be silent. I’m planning to sell everything and then buy a gun and jump into the ocean (my least favorite thing cause I have thalassophobia so they won’t think to look there. I’m going to apologize in my suicide note and also give all my money to my parents cause I at least should do that for all the trouble I caused them I say I might do it cause I know it’s a selfish thing to do, I do have people that care about me, but again I feel like I’m a burden and they’re better off if I never existed, I talked to a therapist and that only made things worse cause they sounded to annoyed so I stopped seeing them. I talked about it to some really close friends but no matter what they said I still want to die. I’m putting my fate on finals, if I fail, I know I’m a complete loser. Again, I know a lot of people have it a lot worse and I’m selfish, but I feel like everyone’s lives would be better without me in it."
3723,leaving this group.,"not because i’m doing it but quite the opposite. i mean i still think about it all the time, but just now i was in a relatively decent mood until i saw a post on here and it reminded me of my dark side again, hoping to start getting out of this mindset, it’s harder than hell and won’t be anytime soon for sure but leaving this group is a good start i think. wish me luck"
3724,Don’t know,"How do people live normally. How do people handle having a job. How do people handle responsibilities and stress. I can’t, and I haven’t. Now I’m facing the consequences, I guess. 

I want to give up, I’m not cut out for living. I can never be a normal person because my brain doesn’t work right. What can someone that can’t handle having a job do when they keep getting older. I can’t rely on my parents forever, they don’t even want to help me anymore. They think I just need to get over my fake depression. I was supposed to be the kid that powered through it all, lived a normal life like my brother can’t. Little do they know the only difference between me and my brother is that I was heavily conditioned to hide everything wrong with me. 

I can’t keep up the facade anymore, I can’t keep trying. My mind is exhausted. I can’t work at a job with losing composure anymore. I hate that I can’t control my life anymore. I’m so tired. How do I tell my parents that I can’t do it anymore when they’re already going through so much. 

I’m wondering if I’ll end up like my cousin, I’d hope my family could handle my suicide like his family did."
3725,The First Time I Googled Methods to Killing Myself,"It's not my first time committing suicide. I was sure, overdosing on sleeping meds in a hospital bed was enough to stop those thoughts. Nope. 

It seems to have gotten worse. Pretty much, I have bipolar disorder and I guess my depressive moods are heightened with the winter seasons (darker and more gloomy). Plus, I barely see my friends at all, same with my family and cats/dog. So I'm pretty much alone. 

Added to that, I have this huge guilt of not wanting to share my thoughts with friends/family because I'm scared I'll become a bother. In a recent and past experience, a best friend of mine stopped being friends with me because he never felt like we had a friendship. He felt like a therapist in my life and he suffered for it. So now I don't even share my problems with anyone anymore, especially my boyfriend. 

And lately my brain has been calling me ugly, so now I'm justifying the act of just starving myself. My boyfriend didn't talk to me at all today, so I'm just ruminating and thinking he is over me and he's bored of me. He's not thinking of me and he deserves better. 

I think he doesn't have feelings for me (no reason given) because that has happened to me before (first year of college with some boy). And that ""some boy"" sexually abused me, and now I feel incapable of handling love or trusting that someone actually truly loves me. 

Plus it's finals. And as I'm studying, I am also beating myself up for feeling bad BECAUSE THERES NO TIME TO FEEL BAD. YOU HAVE EXAMS TO PASS. 

And then all this together sums up the pressures to just end it all (plus, global warming and climate change and the world ending soon). 

TL;DR I want to kill myself because life is giving me too much pressures right now simultaneously."
3726,I feel so lost,This is my first time posting here so im sorry if this isnt how it works. Ive been depressed ever since I can remember being a teenage and im 21 now. When i was 17 i tried to take my own life by taking a decent amount of ambien xanax and a couple hydros (I was just trying to take as many pills as possibe) my mom and sister found me in my room and the rest of the night is blurry from there. Ive never been able to share my emotions or how i feel im always to embarrassed and feel like my problems dont matter to anybody so i bottled everything up my whole life and I shut people out and turned to drugs to self medicate. Even after my attempt I still kept taking xanaxs and coke and smoked a bunch of weed and drank a bunch which never helped. And now im in college and people ask my about my life before i moved here and I struggle so hard with my memory to remember anything before my senior year of highschool years of my life just erased which just keeps spiraling me into my depression.  Ive always been suicidal but I put on a fake smile and nobody suspects a thing and if i have to keep fighting this myself I dont know how much longer i can take it I always have my bottles of anti depressants and anti anxiety right next to my bed and im always tempted to wash them all down with the vodka right next to it. Especially recently i’ve been feeling so down it comes in episodes and ill just spiral out of control. Im sorry this post is all over the place I have a hard time getting my feelings out and ive never posted on bere before.
3727,One more thing crossed off the “guilt checklist” today,"I really think that my dog is the only thing keeping me alive at this point.

My mom would be destroyed if I died but she’s abusive towards me and only knows how to show love with money.

My dad chose his new wife over my brother and I when I was 8.

My little brother was the only thing I’ve been holding onto but he has a superiority complex and I today I found out he and my husband have been texting about me behind my back being “the way that I am” - I have PTSD from years of being stalked and assaulted. I had an anxiety attack during Thanksgiving and everyone was disgusted. The stalking is still going on. Everyone around me is tired of it and doesn’t think it’s a big deal. This person raped me and physically attacked me. The police never enforced the broken order of protection and he’s still out there. 

My husband explodes on me in anger all the time and blames me for it. I used to have so much love and respect for him but now it feels like I’m living with a dumb brick who only cares about his dog. Because I’ve been sexually abused I can’t be intimate with people who are threatening to me and so the thought of having sex with him feels like rape. 

I randomly cry for no reason, I just get choked up and can’t breathe. I can’t function at work and asked for a demotion so I could start fading away. I need Xanax to sleep. I’ve been in therapy for a year and it’s not helping. Before that I’ve seen 4 other therapists. 

I’m in my 30s and everyone’s pressuring me to have kids. Fuck that. I know I’m at a huge risk for postpartum depression, even psychosis. I’m scared about what I’d do to a baby.

I wish I would die in an accident so that people would just fuck off and blame someone else."
3728,this sub only ever makes me more suicidal,"can anyone else relate lol

if nobody can think of a good reason for me to continue to suffer like this then please just tell me to die"
3729,I’m struggling,"This is just a dump. 

I came forward about being sexually assaulted by an old teacher of mine and, as a result, many of my friends have been mad at me. They were mad at me for not waiting to talk with a therapist about it before going to the police. Nothing ended up happening and the teacher is still teaching children. 
I am a part time caretaker for my disabled older sister. I have been my whole life. 
I’m 16 years old. I’m transgender and most of my extended family won’t even talk to me. 
My mom is my best friend. I love her so much. She’s the only reason i haven’t killed myself. 
I just feel so lost. I keep screaming out for help and it doesn’t seem to matter. I’m ignored or blocked out by so many people."
3730,IM JUST GOING TO KILL MYSELF,I WANT TO DIEEEEEE I JUST WANNA DIE I NEVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING EVER AGAIN. HOW CAN I GET AHOLD OF CERTAIN POISONOUS GASSES TO KILL MYSELF WITH? EVERY MALE JUST WANTS ME TO KILL MYSELF. ALL MALES WANT ME TO BE DEAD
3731,I'm just so tired,I'm tired of jumping through hoops just to get myself to a tolerable place mentally. I don't want to be under all this stupid fucking stress anymore. I'm tired of being such an emotional person. I'm tired of feeling lost within myself without a bearing on who I am. My heart just can't take this. it just hurts so much.
3732,No one cares,Sometimes cutting my wrist feels less painful than continue to exist
3733,Trouble Sleeping,"I'm lucky enough to not be in a constant state of wanting to kill myself. But then there are those low moments. I tend to have really low moments.  It seems consistent. Every other week. I'm getting help and it sometimes works. Talking to friends also helps. I just find myself feeling like I'm drowning and everyone else is on shore encouraging me to swim to them. Every now and then someone I'm close to is drowning next to me. In those moments, I pretend I'm stronger then I am. I try to hoist them up so they can make it back to shore. A lot of times when I'm not feeling great I try to talk to strangers struggling. I know how lonely I feel so I just want to listen, want them to feel heard. If I'm stuck in the bad space, the best I can do at that point is weather the storm and see if I can help out the fellow citizens of suicidal-thoughtsville. Tonight I'm there. I've been there for longer than I've been there in a while. I'd really like to listen and help others but tonight I don't think I have the strength. The best I can do is reach out and hope someone hears me. For what its worth, maybe at least someone can read this and know that they aren't alone in the shithole. 

I promised myself when the knot slipped that I'd take the long way, the scenic route to the end of my life. It's suffering with brief slivers of peace. I'll relish in the tiniest moments of anything that's not suffering, not pain. I find peace in the truth that life has no meaning. We are all just space dust. Every shitty feeling. Every good feeling. The assholes we meet. The good people we meet. The feelings of loneliness. The feelings of normalcy. Pain. Pleasure. Once the tiny ember that is our life burns out, there's nothing. No pain, no peace, just nothing. So i'll suffer til the end because what's the point."
3734,I cant last any longer,"Ive gone 50 hours without cutting myself. I cant help the pain anymore, i hurt so bad i miss the distraction. I need it, i miss it. Someone tell me how to stop"
3735,Let me make you a playlist please,"Howdy y’all, I’ve had depression/anxiety for a long time and after several years of self harm and a suicide attempt, I know the struggle intimately. Music is basically what helps me stay alive from one day to the next. If you’ll let me, I want to make you a spotify playlist so you have something to listen to on the especially hard days, or maybe just days that you need a reminder that somebody cares.  Drop a descriptor for your music taste/what you’d want and maybe a few of your favorite songs and I’ll give you a link to the playlist I make for you :)"
3736,please just say anything,"i feel so empty and i'm so alone and nothing helps. nobody cares about me. nobody even pretends to care.

i've exhausted every option in the hope of finding support. none have been successful.

why should i stay alive when nobody wants me here?"
3737,"""It'll (eventually) get better!""","Everyone just says ""Yeah it might take forever but it'll get better eventually!"" Yeah it might take 10 years but it'll be good then and you'll be grateful!


But then you have to sit and think. Is that amount of suffering worth what might come after? That's a question I think only the person experiencing it can answer. Other people can't, none of you can.



I say my life won't be ok for 10+ years and when I explain why you agree with me, but then you say somehow it's worth it to suffer that long.



What if it isn't? What if the scale when you put 30 years of absolute suicidal misery on one side and 40 more of average existence tips to the side of misery? What if this suffering really isn't worth what MIGHT come after? Even in a best case scenario maybe I'd be too depressed for too long for it to even matter?



And again, you can't decide that only I can"
3738,I am incapable of knowing what happiness even feels like anymore,"i am nothing more than a shell of a human being. if i'm not completely apathetic to the world around me, i'm busy crying. i think optimism is delusion. i haven't actively looked forward to anything in years. i just except everything to go poorly, and i tend to be right.

the pills have kind of worked, in that i can actually leave the house now. i couldn't do that like, 3 years ago. but going outside doesn't make me feel happy. it makes me feel a whole lot worse, actually.

i haven't had any kind of real interests or hobbies since i was in elementary school. i have absolutely zero motivation to pick any up. i'm physically incapable of it. my brain tells me it's a bad idea. speaking from experience, it usually is a bad idea. I'm extremely fucking stupid, so whenever i try something new, i never understand it, no matter how many times someone will try and explain it to me. so i just end up crying.

this isn't fun. what even is fun? do i know anymore? is the feeling i have when i'm not crying ""happiness?"" i can't remember. maybe i haven't experienced what other people consider happiness in my entire life."
3739,It's over,"I can't do this anymore. I have never been close to anyone, and by that I mean friends or lovers. I am so alone, I truly do think it's time for me to leave."
3740,I will try to kill myself again.,Because apparently the first time it wasn't enough to do it.
3741,I want to go back too bad,"I wanna go back, I need to go back... I want to be a kid again so badly it sends me to bed every night in a heap of tears. As someone who struggles with depression, this is my only desire. Not to be rich, not to be famous, nor to go back a year or two. I want to go back.. too badly."
3742,Make the emptiness end,"There is no hate, no sorrow. Nothing. My life is permeated by the lack of all emotions. I'd rather be despised or abused, at least someone would feel something towards me.

But this crushing apathy and anhedonia coupled with the ceaseless loneliness. 

There's no way out.

There was never a way out.

I'm not someone who will be able to taste of life's greatest buffer of emotions. Love, fulfillment, hope, hate, sorrow, anxiousness, all these aren't real for me.

Instead I'm empty.

I can't stand being empty for much longer."
3743,i hope you guys have a better life than i had,you deserve it more than me
3744,I'm tired of trying,"I'm trying and it doesn't even matter. I can't get the feelings to go away.

I started taking antidepressants again. I downloaded worksheets to try manage my feelings while I'm on a waitlist for therapy. I'm exercising regularly and eating healthier and trying to sleep more regularly. I reached out to my only friend and kept in contact throughout the semester despite feeling the compulsive need to bolt. I registered to volunteer at my library.

But I can't stop feeling like it's meaningless. I'm 23 and I have no job, hardly any friends, a sixth year of university to ""look forward to"" (because I'm a failure) but with no idea what my future holds (also because I'm a failure). I haven't been able to actually volunteer yet because I've been so miserable and I'm scared the organizers have run out of patience with me. I'm scared I'm going to be like this forever, that I'll always be off to the side and unremarkable and unwanted, that I'm unlovable, and I'm scared I missed out on my opportunity to have fun and be carefree and to really feel young or be happy because I've felt like this with no respite since I was twelve years old, and I've compulsively isolated myself for almost as long.

I use other social media in an ill-advised attempt to connect to other people and it hasn't had any effect. Nobody seems to want anything to do with me. I don't have any hobbies beyond my academics because of how depressed I am and, understandably, nobody wants to talk about that all the time. I can't think of anything else I enjoy doing, I don't even enjoy my studies that much anymore but if I don't force myself to focus on academics I have no reason to be alive. I can't make myself enjoy popular culture because at some point I've developed this almost nihilistic view of the world and I don't see the point in anything that seems so pointless.

I've talked to people in my classes but they all seem to hate me for some reason or another. I'm not socially inept in any way, and I know I can be fairly easy to talk to and almost charming at times. But nobody has any long-term interest in getting to know me. I never want to impose myself on others' lives so I don't force the issue if somebody stops talking to me with no warning.

I just don't understand what about me is so repulsive to others and nobody will tell me what the problem is. Even people online have decided it's fun to taunt me and call me ugly and to tell me I should kill myself. I know that's my fault for being so immature in the first place by looking to the internet to connect to others but that doesn't stop it from hurting.

I can't connect to people my own age for friendships or anything else. It feels like everyone has their own circle of friends already established and I feel like an outsider. And other people my age tend to be successful, starting their careers with things to look forward to and happy memories to reflect upon, and I have nothing in my past or future besides a slow decline and massive gaps in my memory from when every day faded together into years of isolation and depression.

I haven't dated since I broke up with my girlfriend last year and the only people interested in me are desperate men in their fifties, most of whom seem to just get their kicks from insulting my appearance. It sounds fucked up but I feel bad knowing that nobody even wants to use my insecurities to take advantage of me.

I keep spiralling several times a day now. In the past few months I'd cut down the number of serious breakdowns I have from a near-daily occurrence to something that only happens once every few weeks. I don't know why it's gotten so bad again and I'm scared because I don't feel in control of it at all. Earlier today I was convinced that I'm literally subhuman in a way that other people can instantly notice, and that's why people don't approach me or talk to me except out of pity or in order to treat me like shit. I'm still playing around with the idea in my head because it seems like the only explanation for the pattern that's shaped my life up to this point. It's like there's something seriously wrong with me, either a deformity or a behavioral abnormality, that I'm unable to identify and destroy. It's my fault because the responses I get are a natural response to whatever it is. But I can't fix it no matter how hard I try.

People are running out of their patience with me. I don't even fucking bother anyone with how I feel because I don't want to put that burden on them, but sometimes it slips through and all I ever get in response is annoyance. With my body dysmorphia, people tell me not to be vain, everything else and I'm told to see a therapist, not out of any concern for my wellbeing but just to get me out of the way. Everyone just wants me to shut up. I go on places like this one and beg anyone to pretend to care and nobody ever does.

I'm so tired of being unwanted in every aspect of my life. I hate that I can't get a job or make friends because I'm too much of a failure to do anything besides lie in my bed and fantasize about dying violently. I'm tired of my pain being secondary to the fact that I'm inherently repulsive in some way that I can't recognize or fix. I'm tired of being a burden on the few people who even know who I am.

If I died nobody would find my corpse for weeks, and if someone found me they'd be only somewhat more disgusted by my bloated, maggot-ridden corpse than they'd be by seeing me at the grocery store. I want to kill myself and rot in the ground and be totally forgotten like I guess I deserve."
3745,Ideas,Trying to figure out the best inconspicuous way to connect my exhaust to my window. I don’t need reasons to not; just look for honest answers.
3746,Just got back from a party.,I hate myself. I feel so awkward. I have no one to talk to talk to. Not sure why I'm posting this but I just need to vent. Just drunk and sad. Good vibes to everyone else.
3747,Working up the courage,"I'm a borderline crazy cunt, hopefully soon."
3748,everything seems pointless,"hi everyone, I'm sill pretty young and new to the sub/Reddit so pls cut me some slack. I'm still getting used to all this. 

It's my first year in college and i just feel so profoundly lost at this point i don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. I was a pretty good student in high school and I go to a pretty good liberal arts school now but i still just don't feel drawn to anything. even stuff that is interesting to me for a couple of days or weeks eventually fades. I've always been sort of an unhap\[y person, and have had like sort of suicidal thoughts since i was like 11ish. Not really serious ones I guess but like the kind that just tells you its an option you should take. every day. 

Im sure this is gonna sound dumb, but im having a lot of probelms with this boy. I go to school with hims and he's a couple years older than me. I relaly tried so hard to go to a different college, just becsue i thought ot would be better fro me to be bey myself, and i ended up going here bc its the best potion fr my middel class family. I didnt want to put my paents in debt bc im to pussy to deal with this boy im in love with. So this big coincidence happens. And again, I know tjsi sounds dumb, but today, i relaized he doent care about me at all or even think about me. I consider him one of my claest frinds and i know npw taht he doenst even ever think about me. Iv ebeen in a really abd place all week, just very lethargic and doen on myself, but today i just broke. I dont know how to decribe it, im completely beyond repair. I feel like suicide is my only destiny now, which is so scary bc ive never feklt that before.

And i feel so dumb saying it becise it seem slike such a stupid thin t o get hung up on. It hutrs that he doent love me, so bad, but it hutrs even more to reailze that the peopel i would die fro dont even think about me. I dont knwo if any of you have ever been in this situtaion.

Usullay i would tun to weed or booze right now (bad coping mechanism i know, but better than dying) but for the first time i have no desire to. I juets want to go to sleep and never wake up. I have enough here for me to die, but im still scared. Someone help please."
3749,Sharing my testimony of Jesus Christ in the case it might help someone,"I started drinking when I was 16. I would drink at parties, but I also started drinking alone because I was unhappy, and I was in a lot of emotional pain all the time. My mom was very aggressive when I was younger, and my brother hated her and so did I. He started hanging out with shady people, he started failing all his classes, he was never home, and my parents fought all the time. I also ran away several times. I was always trying to figure out a reason as to why I was here or what the purpose of life was. So, I started looking at different philosophies, religions, and beliefs. When I was 18 after I was hungover, I got on my knees and I prayed for the first time. I asked if God was real that he would show me he was real because I couldn’t take it anymore. I was crying when I prayed for this. At that moment I felt a presence come over me like a wind. It was barely noticeable, but it was unlike anything in my life I had experienced up until that point. I was surprised when I felt it and I remember saying “what was that?” after that experience I pretty much forgot what happened and kept partying, until my senior year when I got arrested. After my arrest, my parents lost all their trust in me and I was expelled from high school. I was told never to come back. At that time, I felt afraid and hopeless. That’s when I started looking for God, and I prayed that he would reveal himself in my life and that he would give me signs. My prayers began getting answered so consistently that I couldn’t deny that God was doing something. It was mysterious and compelling. I ended up in Church and started reading the bible hours a day. I stopped hanging out with all my other friends because they were continually getting arrested. I was able to forgive my family and myself and to ask to be forgiven. I noticed how at Church people were judgmental and how they formed cliques but were afraid to be around anyone else different from them. It increased my faith because I realized Jesus was not like that and ever since I was young, I saw people as people regardless of who they were. After a while, it’s like I could see God's presence was in my life and then it felt like he wasn’t, and then he was, and then he wasn’t. One day I woke up and felt more depressed than I ever have in my entire life. I felt like I was dying on the inside. That night I prayed, and I said, God, I don’t see my life five years from now I'm going to die Jesus save me Lord, please save me. I was weeping when I said it and when I asked him to save me, I felt a presence inside of me like a heartbeat, and I felt it once like a pulse, and I said Lord please save me and I felt it again even stronger. It was like radiance. When I woke up the next morning, I had transformed everything felt brand new like I was a kid again. All my fears and all my racing thoughts everything was gone. I looked at my hands, and I said this can’t be real it’s impossible. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I saw a different person. I started praying, and the holy spirit became entirely real to me it was washing over me and inside of me. It was total love and peace, and I heard a voice but not an audible one, it was an inner voice. It said I am with you; I love you, I will never leave you, it’s done it’s finished. That was May 3rd, 2009, and ever since then I’ve followed God, I have seen many things change and many things I know wouldn’t have changed without faith and belief. I know what it’s like to be lost to feel you have no hope. Don’t ever think you’re stuck, or life can’t change because it can. My mom is a Christian now, Its night and day. Some of the things that went away during that period were severe anxiety and my addiction to alcohol. I’ve seen and experienced so many things that are miraculous and seen how God has worked in my life. When we ask God to forgive us for what we’ve done and turn away from our sins and wrongdoings and we believe in Christ's sacrifice everything changes. His word says if we confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and believe in our hearts that he died and rose again we will have eternal life but not just life after death but abundant life in the present. Our sins are erased not only past, present, and future but our burdens and fears are lifted also. Our thoughts, our minds, our hearts, our souls are transformed and united with God and we know his spirit lives in us. If you seek, pray, and knock you will know JESUS IS KING!!! HE LIVES!"
3750,I want someone to tell me to kill myself,"I think that would be the final push I need to finally get it over with. Demolish all my hope with those three words. Please, I’m begging you."
3751,Attempted a year ago and a friend got in the way.,"At least once a week since, I’ve been so mad at her. Wish it had worked. This fucking sucks."
3752,My now ex bf also father of my son..,"Idk where to begin, i am (28f) my ex is (33m) its been a 4 yr roller coaster that i can no longer take.. I have a child with a man that i barely new (i know, mistake) he was perfect in my eyes BEYOND handsome but had nothing going for himself really.. We had this party life relationship drinking no responsibilities and living with our parents..i was GOOD to him but ignored some of the warning signs. Months passed his dad died and he took it kind well ( obviously hid his emotion) i helped as much as i could..i TRIED MY HARDEST TO LOVE HIM AND NURTURE HIM TO JUST BE THERE!..11 months into our relationship i was pregnant. While 5 months pregnant we got into a bad fight in his truck he was drunk and grabbed a knife and was trying to kill himself , i of course jumped on him begging for him to stop but he just ""wanted to die"" i then started to learn more about him....We have a beautiful happpy LOVING son i wouldnt change for the world. We lived together for some time maybe 2 yrs, it wasnt good at all. I started to become afraid of him and my childs saftey he has never laid hands on me , i actually have punched him once and our fights got worse...and worse. I found him cutting himself in the kitchen once while our child was asleep. Then i started to learn (hes always been suicidal)  he joked one time drunkingly ""whose gonna die today me or you"" while he flipped a quarter...IM NOT SAYING I WAS THE BEST WOMEN IN OUR LATER RELATIONSHIP but part of me is scared i hurt him to be this way or i am the reason he is pretty much ""satan"" now. He's a dark soul and loves the idea of evil and heavy metal. I feel hes an evil man and its best i run now. I have been living with my parents whom are heaven sent. I text this now not knowing what is right or wrong. I HAVE gone to his mother and told her he NEEDS help i habe gone to his family his friends...he just seems to BE THIS WAY. And no one tries enough to help him. I habe helped and i cant anymore, i give up...and im probably making him MORE MISERABLE and hurting him more. The story i told you today was 1 percent of our FUCKED relationship and how hes has mind fucked me , belittled me, mentally abused me. Its been 1 week since my final decision to leave him and hopefully co parent (which isnt gonna happen i guess anytime soon) and he has been non stop texting me how hes gonna kill himself. Hes has been doing this to me for so long that i could just throw up with all the anxiety....i have a son to love and help grow RIGHT...i cant do this anymore... If anyone that took their time to read this and has advice on how to get complete rights to a child that would help. Id never take my son away from his father fyi but this man has used our son against me and pushes my button. I hope im doing the right thing for the sake of my son. Pray for me."
3753,"I have an illness, and I’m stuck in a circle","I know something is wrong with me, something has been wrong with me for a very long time. Around the age of 12 I started having odd mood swings and stages of apathy. 

A lot of my moods and inner thoughts could be explained away by puberty and teenage drama. But there was always something deeper there. 

It seems to ebb and flow, I’ll feel good, then drop so down low. It’s been nearly a decade of this ebb and flow that I’ve somehow managed enough to be successful. I graduated with a 4.0, I’m in law school, things should be good! Things should be looking up!

But there still something so clearly wrong with me. My mind feels constantly scattered and torn. I have waves of motivation, mixed with thoughts of helplessness and general apathy. Yesterday I woke up at 8am and stared at the ceiling for 4 hours before I could work up any sort of motivation to even go to the bathroom.

I tried to get help a couple months ago, I spoke with a psychologist at my law school’s crisis center and I started to feel like maybe I would get answers. He seemed to think I may have some form of bipolar, which may be true, but then I started getting thoughts about how a diagnosis can ruin my future

About how all of this shit, that I’ve managed to hide so well for 9 years will come crashing down on me the moment I get a diagnosis 

And so I stopped going and I thought I could deal again but now I’m back in a spiral

I have a lot of pills, I have narcotics left from when I got my wisdom teeth out, I have a bottle of rum. And maybe the only way out is death. Maybe I’ll finally be a coward and end it all. Despite the fact I’ve been given everything I need for happiness maybe this is the only way out"
3754,Anyone else feel like they aren't normal?,"Because I do. I completely don't know how to act normal and do normal things that a human should and normally does do.

He told me details of how he had killed a suicidal girl before and wanted to do it again. He only does it to willing women.. and I was willing. We planned it for a long time. He was going to fly me to his town... but I chickened out. I feel so regretful now, and wish I hadn't deleted our convo."
3758,I don’t want to be alive tomorrow,"I’m turning 20 tomorrow but in reality I was supposed to be dead 2 years ago. I never saw myself getting this old and now I don’t know what to do with my future. I’ve thrown it away. Nobody I know truly appreciates me for who I am so if I die will it really matter? I’ll be forgotten in a years time. Will anyone know about it? Probably not, and nobody will know about what I’m going to do after I get off work. 

I’m just tired :("
3759,Simpler,"Every morning i awake knowing what will come. When i was younger i use to awake wondering about fun. I go through my day hoping for the night. I never thought i could feel so wrong. It all use to be so easy to belong , but as the sun sets and the moon rises i only think of what death could be hiding. Will i go back to just wanting to run. Or will i still cry over everything ive done. I lay my head in my pillow and close my eyes , and hope in my heart that i will die. I dream of wants, i dream of love, i dream of things that make me less numb. As i go through these dreams i dread the sun, and hope that maybe it will never come."
3760,I just deleted everyone,"Please someone talk to me so I don’t kill myself tonight, please."
3761,What’s the point,"Ive talked to people a lot. My mom has Cana right and isn’t much longer for this world. My dad is an abusive alcoholic drunk. My other siblings I have 8 are all depressed or suicidal. My favorite little brother recently started cutting himself and it fucking broke me. I spent hours crying. I’m a guy and before this I never cried. I spent 2 years curing myself and planning my suicide. I haven’t yet but everytime I’m drunk it I think about it I want to. I hate myself so much. I wish I could kill my father or stop him, other times I think I’m over reacting and I’m in the wrong. I’m self conscious and even when drunk can’t relax or let loose because I’m scared.  He hits then yells and makes them feel like shit. I moved out at 17 and I feel guilty for leaving them in that shit hole. I have a profession set for me that pays a lot of money but I still wish that I die in my sleep every night. Idk why I’m posting I’m just drunk and figured why not"
3762,Something from the internet,"Something from the internet- if you are feeling suicidal now, please stop long enough to read this. It will only take about five minutes. I do not want to talk you out of your bad feelings. I am not a therapist or other mental health professional - only someone who knows what it is like to be in pain.

I don't know who you are, or why you are reading this page. I only know that for the moment, you're reading it, and that is good. I can assume that you are here because you are troubled and considering ending your life. If it were possible, I would prefer to be there with you at this moment, to sit with you and talk, face to face and heart to heart. But since that is not possible, we will have to make do with this.

I have known a lot of people who have wanted to kill themselves, so I have some small idea of what you might be feeling. I know that you might not be up to reading a long book, so I am going to keep this short. While we are together here for the next five minutes, I have five simple, practical things I would like to share with you. I won't argue with you about whether you should kill yourself. But I assume that if you are thinking about it, you feel pretty bad.

Well, you're still reading, and that's very good. I'd like to ask you to stay with me for the rest of this page


Start by considering this statement:

Suicide is not chosen; it happens
when pain exceeds 
resources for coping with pain.

That's all it's about. You are not a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed, because you feel suicidal. It doesn't even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If I start piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights... no matter how much you want to remain standing. Willpower has nothing to do with it. Of course you would cheer yourself up, if you could.


Don't accept it if someone tells you, ""That's not enough to be suicidal about."" There are many kinds of pain that may lead to suicide. Whether or not the pain is bearable may differ from person to person. What might be bearable to someone else, may not be bearable to you. The point at which the pain becomes unbearable depends on what kinds of coping resources you have. Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to withstand pain.

When pain exceeds pain-coping resources, suicidal feelings are the result. Suicide is neither wrong nor right; it is not a defect of character; it is morally neutral. It is simply an imbalance of pain versus coping resources.

You can survive suicidal feelings if you do either of two things: (1) find a way to reduce your pain, or (2) find a way to increase your coping resources. Both are possible."
3763,;(,"I'm 18, I'm a freshman in college, I've never been in a relationship, I've never had friends outside of people I met online but even they dont like me. I've never accomplished anything. I can barely get a part time job to support myself because of my poor social skills. I've been abused. I've been neglected. I've been hurt by many. I've been ignored. I haven't been interested in living in a very long time. Due to situations, I was never able to stick to anything long enough to get good at it. Although I consider myself to be kind of attractive, no one looks in my direction. I've had a very mediocre life and I think it's time to call it quits. Cant say I've let anyone down because no one even had high expectations for me, not even myself. Not sure how I wanna leave yet but I'm going to get in my car somewhat shortly, maybe within the next 2 hours and figure it out from there. Its currently 1 am.

3765,fuck life,"  So lately. I’ve had a lot of stress because of school (I have midterms, tests, and a whole bunch of projects due within the next 2 weeks). It’s kind of overwhelming. And it doesn’t help that I get anxiety over every single thing. On top of that I have depression. I don’t have a lot of friends. And even those friends, I don’t feel like I can talk to them about how sad I actually am. It just feels like a burden to them and I don’t think they’d understand the pain I’ve been through On top of that, I came out to my parents , and my mom didn’t take it so well, and told me that it was just a phase and that I “shouldn’t go around telling lies”. like, I’ve known who I am for 2 years. You wanna know how she found out I was bi? My mom looked through my text messages. I never gave her the password to my phone, I honestly don’t know how she got in, and I don’t know if I want to know. I don’t really trust her as a result. One time I must have really looked like shit, because my science teacher straight up asked “are you okay, I’m here for you?”. I told him that, nah, I wasn’t really ok, and then he referred me to the school therapist. That was the first time I felt like some one cared for me in a while.  But I honestly feel that no one would care if I died. I just want to be gone and disappear. Sometimes during class I get random thoughts of suicide, and that scares me. I’m scared that I might actually go through with killing myself. It’s a paradox; because I feel that the world would be better off without me. But there’s one or two people I know would be hurt and I don’t want to hurt them. But the majority of people won’t give a shit if I die. I’m just a huge waste of space.  And that’s basically my long rant."
3766,i think i'm gonna do it soon,"i'm so exhausted. waking up hurts, going to school hurts, trying to sleep hurts. i'm just sick of it. i have schizophrenia and it's taking a huge toll on me. i just want it to stop i just want it to be quiet. everyday i think about attempting. i wish i had a reason  to stay"
3767,"I think I’m happy, but I want to kill myself","I’ve been having these thoughts for a couple of weeks now, and I just can’t shake them. They’re thoughts where I’ll get the urge to kill myself, and they come out of nowhere, it doesn’t matter if I’m in my room or in my college’s dining hall. I’ve also been very depressed the last weeks or so, and have been thinking of myself to be a “party pooper” to my friends and thinking that they secretly don’t like me but don’t want to tell me to my face. 

I thought that these thoughts were coming from being alone too much, as I didn’t talk with very many people over thanksgiving break, so when I came back to college I forcefully inserted myself  into the figurative butthole of one of my friends to eliminate any alone for me. This kind of helped, but the first night back I still had those suicidal thoughts, and I actually tried to kill myself that night, and it really hasn’t gotten any better. 

I’ve tried hinting these to my friends, but I have quite the fun and bubbly personality, which makes me feel pressured to always be smiling and/or cracking jokes. Because of this, my hints usually come out in self-deprecating jokes that I tell with a huge smile on my face (my most common one is bathtub-toaster time). My friends usually laugh at them &amp; say something along the lines of “don’t say that,” but then we move on.

I guess the point of this is a question that I’ve had. How do I go about getting serious about my suicidal thoughts? I don’t want to have a forced discussion, but I’m such a passive person I more strongly don’t want to change a relatively positive conversation into a serious one. I also know that if I keep going the way I’m going, it’ll eventually be bathtub-toaster time. I can’t afford professional help, so my friends are all I’ve got."
3768,Too much of a fuckup,"I am a useless, cowardly fuckup. If there was a way for me to just disappear, for every trace of me to be erased from the memories of my loved ones and friends, I would hit that switch in a heartbeat. I am a waste of resources and oxygen. I am bound to keep causing those around me worry and pain, and being alive is unbearably painful for me. It's been 31 years and it's been downhill for so much of my adult life. I wish to fucking hell my death wouldn't cause yet more pain. There's no way out of this fucking trap of an existence."
3769,Help lol.,My best friend fucked my mom and beat the shit out of me the fat fuck is hige he destroyes her hes older than me hes 15 its fucking crazy he is pounding my girlfriend too i cant fucking believe this man he made me watch while he pounded them both at other days they loved how he was so much stronger than me physically and mentally i want to cry this is crazy
3770,I know this is a double post could someone tell me it will get better,I just  need some positivpositivity please really anything
3771,The brave ones.,"They say people who commit suicide are cowards but for me its the other way around. I envy their braveness, to end their lives, like they have a total control of themselves. Real brave people knows when to quit. If its useless or hopeless anymore to carry on might as well end your struggles. I hope someday, I will have the courage to be brave and dont worry about what might people around me would feel if i end it."
3772,I'm scared,For the first time I feel peace when I think about suicide. I feel like I have lived enough. I've seen enough. I've loved and lost and I feel lost all around now. I don't know what to do. I'm scared.
3773,I will talk to you.,I will talk to you about whatever you want. Just don’t make a final choice.
3774,Looking for a reason,"A few months ago I suffered a sudden breakup, my live-in partner of almost 3 years chose the day I took my son to college (first time leaving home) to send me a text saying he'd taken some of his things and left because things were 'kind of crazy' for me. He's a 52 yo 'man' btw.

I spent the next day so drunk I can't remember much but it must have been bad because when 1 drunk text meant for him accidentally went to a friend she sent the police to check on me.

The next day I stood on the river bank and wondered if going through the dam would hurt. 

Anyway, long story longer, it's been 4 months. My life has meaning and purpose, I have 2 sons (freshman in college and senior in high school) and a couple hundred middle school students I love who also depend on me. Yet I can't stop the pain, the gaping hole where my heart used to be. I just want the hurting to stop and I'm tured of trying, tired of crying myself to sleep, tired of hurting and tired of being.

I can't even seek counseling because I recently lost access to health care. So I'm looking for advice. Looking for one fucking reason to keep going rather than throw myself in the nearly frozen river and stay there still spring. Help?"
3775,Thinking about cutting myself,Up and down
3776,I don't want to live anymore,I know too much and everything is meaningless. I have lost faith in humanity. I didn't consent to being born.
3777,Hope,"For a few days this past week, I had hope. Which gave me reason to think that perhaps [2020 would be better](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e2f3dj/2020/) after all.

Nah. Literally hopeless."
3778,"CHILD PORN Whistleblowing - Land of Medicine Buddha - Soquel, CA -.NOW I can die!","I've failed multiple serious attempts ( over a dozen.. I've been hospitalized for them in 2 different countries about 5 times ).

I now have brain damage ( an abscess among issues ) from the last few attempts and have increased the lethality of my attempts to the point of having a firearm accident during a recent attempt.
I am also facing legal trouble, ie; a felony terroristic threat charge... For trying to end my own life after being abused and trying to leave a Buddhist cult called FPMT / Land of Medicine Buddha where I discovered child pornography being viewed on the computer of a former staff member, sex abuse / rape of members by a monk and financial crimes ..?!?!?!!!

ALL this shit AND there is a childrens school at 'The Land' and even after trying to report child pronography with the police knowing that there are kids there and even after I attempted suicide.... I get fucking charges?!?

Mer, like you said ""i'm temporary"". So what the fuck does it matter if I air your dirty laundry. I hope someone reports this to the fucking FBI for the love of God and that they investigate the entire FPMT organization and every retreat center and everything they own because children are in danger, people are being enslaved, there is rampant sex abuse and this group is laundering money through property purchases! you'll never get your laptop back bitch and I have all the fucking evidence on it as well as all your emails. Infragard knows how to get in contact with me, somebody have a SAIC call me!

Endentured servitude and slave labor.... 
And ""you have no rights, we OWN you?!?!!!""
Fuck you.

I never threatened you! I have a child and you put my goddamn life in danger. If anybody needs to go to jail that's you. Tonight I end my goddamn life but now everybody knows that YOU protect sex predators, run a cult and that your hands are dirty!!!!

Google : 
FPMT drugs trafficking 
FPMT sex abuse
FPMT blackmail taley

""Lama Yeshe was not Geshe Kelsangs Guru, and luckily Chip had the good sense to also not condone drugs in Dharma Centres. I'm so happy that Venerable Geshe-la has had the courage to stop the drug trafficking in the buddhist centres.  If there is any negativity surely it is the FPMT and those responsible for the drug trafficking who created terrible negative karma by financing their Centres through illegal means. How horrible and what a disgrace to the Buddhasasana.""

Fuck you Mer Stafford!"
3779,Those days when you get blamed for everything again and don’t want to be alive.,Even when you had no involvement and proof to prove it
3780,Not feeling too great.,"Well. It certainly all seems downhill from here folks. 

I recently moved to a new city after deciding to take a year off of school to focus on myself (recently was diagnosed with depression, and have considered myself to be depressed since I was about 14). My friends at school seem annoyed with how much I’m texting/calling them and I’m really struggling to make friends here. A repetitive cycle of me asking them to hang, them being busy, or saying they want to then not following up. Literally, tonight, this guy I met a few days ago was supposed to let me know what time to come hang because he was having people over - and he just never did. I’m sure it wasn’t on purpose but of course I think it was and in my mind I resort it to me having put off some sort of vibe. I’ve been trying so hard to seem normal and interested in being friends with the people I’ve met. I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

I just feel worthless. Like nobody gives a shit about me. I don’t talk or text anyone unless I reach out (which I do!) I’ve never been so lonely before in my life. 

Now without school, I spend my days doing nothing. I never have had a job (20 years old) and just today started applying. Having majored in something art related - the thought of working fast food/serving pretty much makes me want to blow my fucking brains out although I knew it had to come one day and I know that’s just life and I need to suck it up. I can’t believe Ive never had a real job and I feel like shit about it and don’t even think I could flip burgers correctly. I sound like an entitled prick but I guess that’s what I am. I couldn’t give two shits less about my diet or health right now. 

Started smoking cigarettes again, and have been pretty much living off a diet of fast food and other horrible food. Alcohol isn’t as easily accessible now that I’m back to living with my mother, so I’ve gotta make myself feel like shit some way. I feel the most relief whenever I beat the shit out of myself which happens on a daily basis. 

LDR gf and I recently broke things off too and she was pretty much the only person I had to talk to. I loved her more than anyone I’ve been with. I feel like I’m doing everything wrong. I feel like I’ve done all of this so wrong.

I’m in therapy right now and it’s been helping but it’s nights like these where I really don’t see much of a point."
3781,I tried to jump out of the car today,"I got into an argument with my mom while she was driving, at first it was just me staying quiet while she berated me with insults but then she said to me “maybe if I had beaten you like in Trinidad you would have turned out better”. My response was “Jesus fucking Christ” then she hit me. Apparently dad used to beat and swear at her too so she said she had enough. Twenty minutes later she says something to me I can’t remember and I try to jump out of the car. She stopped me and now I’m with my dad."
3782,Keeps Coming Back,"Things are going well in my life. I have dreams and a new job and an amazing boyfriend that I love but every now and then the feeling of just dying comes back and seems so sweet. I'm not good enough, I will never be enough for anyone so whats the point. I want to just walk out of my apartment right now and disappear. It goes away ever now and then but it always comes back."
3783,welp. that's that.,check my post history if you want to. my life was awful and wasn't going to get better.  just washed down a bottle of sleeping pills with a fifth. of Jameson. hope it works. goodbye
3784,I want to die again,I thought I was better. It hasn't been this bad in like 6 months. I don't know what to do
3785,Just a fucking worthless tranny,Earlier this week in the hallways at school I came untucked and a group of kids were like ‘haha look at this girl with a penis’ and I’m pretty sure one kid took a picture of my crotch and I didn’t do anything and I’m too afraid to report in case I’m overblowing things and ahhhh I wanna throw myself off a fucking balcony
3786,...,"I'm struggling with something I've been struggling with for years; being single. I'm 18 going on 19 and I've never had a girlfriend and never lost my virginity and honestly the pressure of being a single virgin in today's society is unbearable. Today my room mate told me I'll never get a girl friend and it really fucking hurt, my friends and family have been virgin shaming me for a while and it really bugs me, I just want to prove them all wrong (and I apologize if I come off as a sad incel)"
3787,Help something feels really wrong.,"My life at this point isn't bad. It's pretty good tbh outside of my parents being shit, but that's always been like that. But for some reason something feels really wrong. Like I think about what's happening in my life rn and it feels so wrong and I even get a bit scared. Can someone please help. I feel so lonely and depressed. Thinking about going to school on Monday and continuing to live feels so wrong, but suicide also feels wrong. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to be alive but I don't want to die I'm so confused. Idk what I want anymore."
3788,Can anyone give me an actual reason not to kill myself?,"""You've got a full life ahead of you."" 

Nope. No I don't. What else ya got? 

""People care about you."" 

Ah yes, true. So I guess I should just suffer and pretend I'm fine for the rest of my life, yep totally worth it. 

""This will get better""

No. I'm progressively getting worse and there's no way out of that. 

Thanks guys."
3789,Is this place I ask help from?,I don’t feel too well and I need someone to talk to
3790,I could use a friend tonight,Just lots going on. I am so mentally exhausted
3791,The thing that’s keeping me from doing it is having my family having to pay for the cremation and burial,The thought of them asking for handouts makes me bawl.
3792,I can't live normally,"I have the horribly naive life goal of knowing everything. I want to know every person and every ounce of information that exists.

Before, I could distract myself. But as I get older, I have lost interest in things like Video Games and TV or Videos. The only thing I'm truly passionate about is music. I want to be the greatest musician to ever live. I want to be the greatest person to ever live. I'm an idiot. I preach the death of ignorance but I am ignorant in saying that  I am not ignorant. 

It's stupid shit like that that just makes me want to fucking die. There is never an answer to anything. I feel like anyone who claims to have an answer to something is just too naive to come up with another question. There is never a finite end. Even me saying that there is never an answer completely contradicts itself! It just goes on and on and on and on forever.

I'm 17, I get that I'm very young. I get that I have my whole life ahead of me and all that bullshit. But I just can't live with the fact that I can't possibly achieve my life's goal. 

And now, I thought that maybe I could find happiness through love. And I thought I loved someone but it all came crashing down around me. And I'm sick and fucking tired of people telling me that it gets better. I KNOW it gets better! I don't want it to get better! It only gets better because you grow to ignore it over time. But my entire philosophy revolves around the opposite sentiment.

I know how I felt in the moment, I know how happy I was and I know that that is gone. And regardless of the fact that I will be happy again, I will never have those moments back. I've always even thought that the best times were underwhelming. When I have to wait so long and suffer so much for a tiny pay off, it just doesn't seem worth it anymore."
3793,"One day to my birthday, and I'm roping tonight.","Of course this is a throwaway, and I'm sorry for formatting as I'm on mobile.

My 16th birthday is tomorrow, but I don't want it to happen at all.
In all my 15 years of life, I haven't done one significant thing to change my life or help others. I've just sort of... existed.
Ive stopped socializing outside of school years ago, and I don't invite people over anymore. I'm not worth it. They're not worth it. Everybody and everything sucks.
Social media demonises men, how the fuck am I supposed to express myself and have an opinion if it gets shut down by two words, ""toxic masculinity"".
My family doesn't like me much, as I tend to keep to myself due to depression, and I'm diagnosed with it and take medication. I bite my nails since early childhood, and I can tell my moms patience is weaning with taking care of my hands. 
I've been going downhill in terms of grades, as I feel less and less motivated. Math has given me multiple panic attack with hyperventilating and massive headaches, and I don't get it. 
I used to have so much potential. I got high 80s with no effort at all. Where the hell did I go wrong? 
I take no drugs, I don't smoke, so my brain should be fine I think. 
My sister gets away with a ton of shit like underage drinking and shoplifting, but it's ok because ShEs oLdEr and I cant talk because I'm ""still a kid"". 
It's a rant, I get that, but I needed to get my thoughts on paper before I kiss my pointless existence goodbye."
3794,What can I do?,"I just feel like there's no point in living. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do for help? I've tried therapy and self-help books, but it's been a year now and nothing has changed. 

I don't want to bore you with my life story but I feel like it's worth mentioning there's nothing obviously wrong with me. I feel like I've done all the things I'm 'supposed' to do, just that there isn't a place for me in this world."
3795,Invasive thoughts overrun me,"Im drowning in debt, and have just started a new job a month ago.. but im back like ive always been, feeling hopeless and invisible like those around me dont see how I struggle.. my wife has all but told me to quit talking about it when im down like this bc she doesn't like feeling helpless to help me. 
I drive home (to my in laws house where she and i are living right now) every day and honestly just wish i had the courage to roll my car or speed into oncoming traffic.
I make alright money now, but it doesnt feel like enough. I dont feel like im making any progress and im terrified.
Im just so full of anger lately and i started smoking again. I dont sleep well without drinking. And as soon as the new year rolls around the cost of all my insurance will be coming out of my paychecks so my take home pay is gonna be cut another 25% every month. But the hours arent conducive to a second job.. 
I just want to feel something.. i want help.. but dont know where to turn.. i feel like ive already lost"
3796,"I want to die, scared to kill my self","Each day, suicide becomes more and more of a tempting and a true ending of the daily pain, anger, sadness, fear, anxiety, loneliness, and ruining my life. I am all alone, so what’s the point? I’d like to not be in pain anymore, what kind of quality of life is that? It doesn’t seem worth it"
3798,Throwing caution to the wind,"I wanted to do it tonight, but I never have the willpower to just go through with it, so instead I threw caution to the wind. I drove him when it was dark with no seatbelt on and faster than I should’ve. If I were to find the strength to finally do it, all I’d have to do is swerve into a tree or electricity pole. Or maybe chance could take me and I’d get into a legitimate accident that would hopefully kill me. More than likely though, and what happened tonight, I just keep on driving and feeling terrible, but somehow not terrible enough to just swerve my wheel a little bit."
3799,I'm planning again,"Last semester I almost committed suicide I had it all planned out that I was going to jump off this bridge on my campus I managed to get some help and go to therapy and I got better but just recently I've been tanking and all I can think of when I lie in bed is that bridge. I'm going home to family over winter break and I always get worse when I come home and I think I might just do it after break. There's just no point I'm just a burden and who actually would really care, sure people would mourn but how long would that last. Eventually everyone I care about would move on and be better from it. It's just so painful keeping up appearances I just dont want to do this anymore."
3800,My family continuously invalidates me and I don't know why I'm staying alive for them anymore,"So they all know that I'm struggling with my mental health, but they don't know anything more than that, and I guess I've hidden everything pretty well. They all started making jokes about suicide and were just laughing about everything and talking about how they were all sure I didn't have any suicidal tendencies. Some of them have fucking watched me try to kill myself. I've tried twice. But apparently my problems aren't that bad and I don't have suicidal tendencies. They don't seem to really believe in any of my problems, actually. They all think self harm is just for attention and refuse to believe that I might do it while hiding it because I explicitly do not want attention for it. They all think I couldn't possibly have an eating disorder (I'm anorexic) because I'm male. They all think I can't have anxiety because I'm quiet about it, I guess? They just invalidate absolutely everything I'm struggling with and then go off talking about how selfish suicide is and how people like me should just get over it. I can't deal with them. Every time mental illness comes up I just feel so much more alone and misunderstood, like why am I staying alive for these people that don't know me and make no effort to understand?"
3801,She’s the only thing keeping me here,I’ve been with my girlfriend a year now. I’d never tell her but she’s the only part of my life keeping me from ending it. I fuck up all the time and I consistently hurt her even though I never mean to. I’ve lied to her more times than I’d care to think about. I truly hate myself and im worthless. My biggest and only fear is losing her or something happening to her. We fought today and things are really dark for me right now.
3802,is here space for a non suicidal person who is just super loneley?,"i feel super sad and loneley, have many days without porpuse. use to play videogames as my big hobbie, now i dont want to play anymore, tried to fix my 6 years relation but i failed, now im lost and alone, have no friends, just tellme that this is just a down, that i going to meet a girl amazing and some great friends, tellme that you, unknow person, are with me. i cant write more. many tears U.U"
3803,"There's basically nothing I, or anyone else, can post here that adequately describes the hell of spending days on end without eating, only drinking and crying. Even if one could, it wouldn't matter anyway. What comfort can I truly get in someone's comment telling me that I shouldn't kill myself?",
3804,I feel like a failure,"I feel like a failure, I hate my life. I haven't accomplished anything."
3805,2 years,It’s been two years since I attempted not sure much has changed or least things haven’t changed for the better.
3806,I just want it to end,"Damned if you do, damned if you don't... so what's the point to try and do? Both my boss and boyfriend acknowledged that I try hard, yet my trying isn't good enough..... So why the f**k should I keep trying? I'm a piece of shit, I know, I hate myself just as much, if not more than they do. I'm tired and I really wish it would all end."
3807,Having a breakdown over tinnitus,"A lot of bad shit has happened over the last several years and music has been one of my coping mechanisms. But I've been in complete denial about my tinnitus. It's been there, I just haven't been able to accept it. It is suddenly hitting me how bad it is. I have permanently ruined my life. Also recently I've lost my job. I have no support network at all and have been running on empty for years. Also other things are catching up with me about the past and I've been coping by serious alcohol abuse. This is so crazy. I am having a breakdown and I'm not in my right mind. I am looking at ways to escape by hanging myself. In going to try and see a doctor but I don't know what they can do. The hearing damage is permanent and it's worse than I can ever believe. I need help I do not have the strength to go through this alone. If I die today I would be free from this horrible life."
3808,Do you think....,Do you think they'll care that my hair is dirty when they find me? Do you think they'll comment about how heavy I was to carry out and talk about how fat I am? What about how I just ate but didn't brush my teeth. I should shower before I go. I should brush my teeth and comb my hair so I look decent as they take me out of my home. It's just hard. I don't have the energy. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep now. Why do I care if they care? I'll be dead
3809,Im ready," So guys this is it. In 4-5 years of depression and suicidal thought, ive never been so close to doing it (even more than when I tried to do it). Ive written letters and bought a scalpel (surgical knife). If I do it, Im gonna take a lot of pain killers and cut an artery. Im gonna do it somewherz crowded because I dont want to die alone."
3810,I don’t see the point in living,"I used to be really deep into depression and idk if i ever got better but now I’m just so sick and tired of living. Thing after thing goes wrong. I can barely afford rent that I’m basically being overcharged for, i have a major in something I don’t even care about bc the chances of me having a stable job in the things i care about is like 0.1%. i have had failed relationships and friendships over and over again so i feel like I have no one to share my problems to. I can’t remember the last time I was genuinely happy. 

What even is the point in living?? Who would want a life like this, constantly crying over not having enough money and knowing my future job won’t make me happy. if I die things might be better for those around me.

i lie awake at night wanting to be stabbed or strangled to death. i need to die so bad, i keep sacrificing myself for others, i help everyone so they can be happy so why can’t i be just a little selfish and leave for good?? 

there is nothing good for me in this life and i don’t even see a point in continuing this, there’s no possibility of anything being better ever again, just the fact that i still exist hurts me more than anything"
3811,I want to die,I just want to die my mom is a piece of shit to me she treats me like shit when I tell her I just want to die she acts like it's attention seeking I tried to slice my throat so many times I can't count it anymore and I'm really good looking it's not that I could not find someone I just can't take this fucking bullshit anymore I don't know with what I'll make my money with I quit my school because my mom said she would pay me my school but she never could pay it without a credit from a bank and I didn't want her to take another one she's owes banks to much already that she can never pay it back but she just said it's none sense and thinks I'm just lying and telling shit to her today she punched me and I got 4 bloody spots she insults me all the time and tells me I'm the one that does that wich I never do and when I argue with her I every time just tell her how I feel completely honest and she just acts like it's ridiculous and would not have anything to worry about  and she never could stop insulting me she does not even notice it she's insane in the worst way what should I do I love my mom and never met my dad and I got a feeling everything she's telling me about him are lies cause she constantly changes the story just a little about him and she always says he was a piece of shit but I'm thinking more and more she is. Sorry for the bad writing !
3812,I had a list of letters,"I had a folder of letters I had written for people. 

Some were notes, in case I finally broke but some were letters. 

I finally deleted that folder today. 


I promised myself one day I would show everyone I had written those letters to all the letters 

But I guess I’m even worse at keeping promises then I thought

I’m so tired."
3813,Anyone else not care if their family gets upset over their suicide?,"Because I don’t. Chances are they’ll fake cry because admitting they are glad might make them look like bad people. And if they do get sad? That’s their problem to deal with. They had their chance to care. I don’t hold it against them though. I don’t care about me so I don’t expect anyone else to. If my parents kicked me out tomorrow morning I would completely understand.

I am a problem in everyone’s life, including my own. I don’t want to get better, I don’t give a damn about the future anymore. Killing myself is the best solution for me and I don’t care if someone else has a problem with that."
3814,Almost able to eliminate the problem,"I'm the problem. I've always been the problem. I've always been a bad person. The worst part is how many people believed in me and supported me, just for me to let them down again and again. Every person who ever supported me was wrong. Every person who ever thought that i could change my behaviors was wrong. Every person who kept trying to assure me I was a good person was wrong.

I've come to the point where I realize me continuing to live does more harm than good. The people I've hurt and let down and disappointed have made their peace and moved on. Now is the time to leave before I fuck anything else up."
3815,How come every sub removes any mention of suicide or depression?,"People always pretend like they care about mental health, but when you use the words ""suicide"" or ""depression"" in most subs, you automatically get either banned or your posts removed.

Why do people treat us like lepers?"
3816,I can't keep doing this,"Failed an exam today... one i studied really really hard for being as though it's vital to my degree. I've failed 5 courses to date and am about to fail a 6th. I was in college for 4 years switching my degree to do what I've always wanted, which i needed to do to increase my gpa and fix all my high school grade. I finally got accepted into a university and all I do is fail. I'm too fucking dumb but I've invested 5 years into this education and i have no other skills and no other driving passions. I am planning on dropping out and killing myself if i do fail this course. I don't even know why i wrote this all out"
3817,What would you do?,"I tried to suicide few month ago but obviously I didn't ended up. I told my mother I wanted to go to a psychologist and she said she would look for one but she isn't, she is pretending like nothing happened. I can't tell my father for various reasons. I can't tell my friends either I tried and it didn't ended up well. I keep thinking about it. I almost killed myself in other occasions after that first attempt. I still feel like shit. What would you do in my place?"
3819,I've got the perfect window and I'm hesitating,"It's been 3 years and a day since my last major attempt, where I blacked out and someone found me before I got to do anything major.
I haven't been able to see or speak to anybody in weeks, really, I haven't really been able to leave the house. 
I have everything I need to do it quietly, now, and everyone's out of the house. I just had my hair done, I have my affairs sorted, and everything's going to be okay... I feel fucking awful because I promised so many of the people I love that I'd not be like this anymore, and I wouldn't act on these feelings, but I've been planning this for months, really.
I can't get over the fear that someone's gonna come home and find me before I can finally fucking croak... Or I'll have severe brain damage because someone thought this was their business. I feel like it'd be better to make sure everyone's home safe and asleep before I do it."
3820,Dying to have someone care about me,":,("
3821,Sitting on “hold” with Suicide Prevention Lifeline Chat for more than 2 hours.,"I don’t want to call the voice line because I’m pretty sure I’m going to start crying, plus I’m at work. I’m  worried about burdening my friends, and I think I’ll feel less anxious about an “objective” listener. But if I was ready to do it (I confess I have a very well-organized plan), I’d be dead by now."
3822,Running out of reasons to not kill myself,"I've been going through the motions and wanting to kill myself since I was 16. I'm 32 now, nothing has improved and I'm just getting more pathetic. I have no friends that would miss me, my family  doesn't need me and would be able to get past it. I've never been in a long term relationship and online dating has not been working for me. I'm just a waste of everything. Taking up space, resources, I'm in debt and am taking a job from someone else who could do it better. I just can't see the point in trying anymore, I'm just going through the motions and nothing ever improves no matter what I do. I just can't see the reasons anymore."
3823,Ive never wanted to die as much as i do tonight,"Im not going to explain what went on in my life for me to feel this way as that would take far too long but basically my mental health has been going downhill for the past year and it seems to just get worse and worse. tonight is the first time ive seriously considered suicide, how i would do it, what my note would say (as cliche as it is yes id want to write a note, my parents at least need closure) and how the world would be if i was gone. ive pushed away every last person in my life who cared so theres really no choice left than to just end it. im not going to do anything tonight, i cant. but i dont know what the future holds. im just unbelievably numb and cant take my life anymore."
3824,It's been a long couple months.,"I don't know, I'm getting tired. I'm generally an anxious person and it's been getting so much worse lately. I'm crying constantly and I know it must hurt my girlfriend (was fiance) to see me like this. At work I'm too anxious to be of any use, I'm literally working the least number of hours a week that I've ever worked in my life because I keep having breakdowns. 

I'm lonely all of the time because I'm a needy piece of shit who needs constant validation. I constantly feel hurt and frustrated because I'm never anyone's first choice when it comes to my friends. At least, it feels that way. I feel like I'm an awful burden and people put up with being around me because I do stupid things sometimes and have a super fun partner. 

I'm too tired. I've fought depression since I was a child (age 11) and have coped with self harm the whole time (24 now) and it is just stupidly exhausting at this point. I used to be smart and interesting and now I'm just..sad. I don't see a point to continuing when every day is the same rat race again and again. People used to tell me it'd get better, but now they just tell me ""that's life kiddo"" and I'm scared I missed the window to get better. 

I just want to die.

I don't think I can kill myself, I don't know. I know my friends would be sad. My partner, my parents would all be sad. But I wish daily that I would get hit by a bus or just not wake up, and more and more, the idea of doing it myself is becoming appealing again. I feel like I'm rotting inside. 

Right now, the only thing I'm keeping myself around for is a fun trip with my friends in March. But on the other hand I'm constantly telling myself that I'm butting in on their fun and that I'll bring down the whole group. Between that and the constant worry that something will financially ruin me between now and then (keeping me from going), I don't know what to do with myself. 

I'm tired."
3825,Why shouldn't I just go away if i'm a monster anyways,"I'm a horrible monster of a person. I abused the trust and kindness of so many people by lying about cancer. Now everyone at my school hates me. I don't blame them of course, I really deserve all the hate I get. I want to make people happy and i've wanted that all my life but I can't say that anymore after what i've done. I feel like ending my life would make so many people happy again. What's the point of living if it just makes people's lives worse?"
3826,is it possible to ever feel better?,"I was six the first time I thought about killing myself. I shoved myself into a Rubbermaid container and begged my friends to put the lid on. I do not know what it is like to live without wanting to die. I've done meds, therapy, and all I want to love life. But I hate myself. I hate feeling like this. I am lonely and cowardly and weak. 

I go to a top tier university on a full scholarship. I have a job that I love. I have a family that cares. But I want to die. I want nothing more than to never have to wake up again. 

Will I ever get over this feeling? Is a life outside of this misery ever possible?"
3827,The only reason I don't try to kill myself anymore is because I know I'll be successful,"I've been shackled with whole array of mental illness for as long as I can remember. Even as a young child I was turbulent and emotional. I used to try to kill myself every few months or so. Nothing too committed, always something with a bit of hesitation and ineffectiveness. A few years ago, I had one extreme attempt. I nearly died. All the doctors said it was a miracle I was alive. Ever since then, I haven't tried killing myself. I'm not any less messed up. I just know now that if I were to ever try again, I would be successful. I know exactly how to kill myself. I know that I have the commitment to do it.it terrifies me that I am capable of this. I know that the next time I attempt suicide I will succeed."
3828,almost killed myself two days ago,was going to do it but i was too pussy. i got nothing to live for but  here i am being a sack of shit again.
3829,yikes,"i'm going to start writing a note, just in case.

i already have a plan; escape the house after the holidays (most likely at sometime late in the night), leave my note on my bed, see if i could go stargazing before i do what i need to do, find a pretty view at some lake far away from home (at least a couple miles), then jump in.

i'll wear my favourite articles of clothing, bring some of my prized possessions, turn on some music, and as i'm in the water i'll close my eyes and just listen.

people say drowning isn't peaceful, but you'll never know if you never try right?"
3830,I wanna die,"Here is a list of the fuckery that has been my life for the past week and a half. 

1) I got my license revoked. 
2) I had to go to the ER because I couldn’t remember my bf of 2 years and got a spinal tap
3) I got diagnosed with Transient Global Amnesia 
4) I got fired from my job 
5) My wisdom teeth decided NOW would be a great time to come in. 
6) I haven’t been able to move for the past 3 days because of the spinal tap 
7) My boyfriend is nearing a mental breakdown. 


I can’t deal with this yo."
3831,I can’t do this anymore. I just want to be done.,I’m 20. I’m completely overwhelmed with life. I feel so suffocated all of the time. I completely fucked myself and failed this semester. My home life is fucked. I’m expected to be a caregiver for my nephews because my mother won’t and I’m trans and my mom is adamant that I’m not and refuses to even try to even use gender neutral pronouns. I’m in an extreme amount of student loan debt and I’m only half way done with school. I just want to die. The longer I live at home the more I want to just end it. But I can’t. I’m too scared to even try and I just wish something would happen to me. I can’t do it anymore. I wake up every day dreading even just getting up and I don’t want to do it anymore.
3832,decided to join this subreddit so;;,"i feel forgotten? my dad only talks about how my step-brother hasn't visited him, my mother is always getting drunk with her friend, my distant family barely visits us, my step-brother decided to move out and live with his mom, and there's just.. no-one here i guess?

i feel so petty whenever i talk about stuff like this, because the truth is, i have it better than alot of people. but i'm stressed, not eating nor sleeping, missing schoolwork/projects, and generally just haven't been in the right head-space. i feel like i'm not here, and if i just took myself out of the equation then maybe my parents would have enough money to get eachother gifts or something idk. i've become really paranoid and keep thinking that someone is in my house, and my elderly neighbor who was like my best friend passed away a couple months back. i don't even know my true identity

i can't stop thinking about my own death. i'm scared but also welcome to the idea. it's all just confusing nonsense to you, i know, but yeah;;"
3833,What to say,"I've written out 4 different suicide notes and I'm not really happy with any of them. It's hard to write a note! What do you say when you're ending your life? I have so much to say that I don't want to ramble in it but I don't want to write a half assed note either. Or should I not write one at all.

3834,"Brother (22) is putting my family through the ringer, and my parents (50+) are just done with him","Brother (22) is putting my family through the ringer, and my parents (50+) are just done with him

It’s taken me a lot to find the energy and courage to write this down, and finally seek help from people other than my therapist. Originally posted to relationship sub, but they removed it. 

In the last week, he has lost his phone and only car keys, and is nearly impossible to get in contact with. 

He lives in a cooperative home with a lot of college students. I just found out he dropped all of his classes, as a 5th year senior. On several occasions he just will blow up at us for no particular reason. Like very angry without warning. He consistently skips therapy appointments, and just is struggling to do things right. I really love him to death and so do my parents. If I had to diagnose him, I’d say he has bi-polar, but there has not been a diagnosis given. 

As an example, for Thanksgiving, I had to go get him from his house because he was strung out or high on who knows what, while I was hungover myself (lol). I’m a 24M and I have a good job and a stable life right now. I drove him to my grandmas and he just sleeps the whole time while we were there, then proceeds to throw a party at his Co-Op on Thanksgiving. 

My parents have been dealing with this for a long time, and they are just at their wit’s end. My brother is suicidal at this point, and has no issues telling us. He blames all of us for his mental state, saying it was how he was raised or treated. I know it’s a cry for help but it just breaks my parents. My mom just completely broke down again today, essentially begging God to let my brother kill himself, because it is so hard for her. She thinks it would be easier for him to die at this point. It hurts me so deep to see her like this, and I wish I could help her. It honestly scares me that she could think this. 

They both are fairly traditional so my attempts to get them into talk to a therapist have been completely rebuffed. They just don’t have “time.” Which is somewhat true, they are building a house and that’s extremely time consuming. That’s no excuse and I think the stigma is the main thing holding them back. 

Anyways, I really don’t know what to do. I’ve considered trying to get him into rehab of some kind, but I really don’t think he would go voluntarily. The only other solution I can think of is to try to bust him for possession so he is forced to go because of the charges. I really don’t think that’s a great solution either. 

Any ideas? To make matters worse, I’m going through my own transition (LTR breakup) and trying to plan out my life, and it’s hard to sort of put some of my life on hold for him over the last 2 months. 

TL;DR Brother (22) is potentially mentally ill. It is starting to really destroy my nuclear family and I’m seeking advice."
3835,There's no hope anymore,"Im exhuasted. 

Plain and simple. 

I go to beauty college 30 hours a week, and I've already been struggling with suicidal thoughts, and the fact that I'm unemployed and homeless. I finally found a job, but it's graveyard shifts for 40 hours a week. I'm already barely hanging on as is. I think this might be the end finally.."
3836,Any jumpers? Why have you chosen this method?,And how have you overcome the fear of jumping?
3837,I don’t know what to do,"Death has crossed my mind recently. I’ve been hurting a lot. I know I’m not alone. I’ve told my family, especially my dad how I feel. He’s been my support. I’ve gotten a lot of advise. “Let it out, cry. Meditate. Go for a walk. Take it day by day. We love you. You’re loved. This will be a lesson in your life. You’re strong”

I’ve been drinking a lot recently to fill my pain.(F24). To a point it’s only made my emotions harder to deal with. I know it, I see it. Yet I do it anyway. 

I’ve been going through a break up. 3 years we were together. 3 weeks we’ve been separated. Due to my bad drinking habits in the past and not stopping, ended our relationship. I’ve made a lot of mistakes. He gave me so many chances. What’s done is done, I know I can’t take it back. This pain in my heart. The regret, shame, and guilt. I can’t forgive myself. 

I’ve been missing work. Digging myself deeper in this hole. Building walls. Sleeping all day, up all night. I’ve lost myself. I’ve stopped the drinking. It’s been hard. Suicide crosses my mind and it’s scary. This sadness is exhausting.

My family has been going through a lot too. Financial problems. I’m suppose to help but haven’t been. My heart is so broken to deal with anything. I’ve lost friends. Got one who is always there, on call all the time. Idk why I still feel like this, after all the support I have. I feel so weak and worthless. I hate what I’m doing. I hate feeling like this."
3838,I dont know,"I feel like the only way out is to kms. My parents say their lives were better with out me. My extended family hates me. I dont have any friends. I try to use art, music and playing games with people to cope but my parents broke my headphones, burned my sketch book and ruined my computer that I use to game and to do school work. Now i cant finish finals for college and I'm probably  going to fail because if it and I am in to much debt to afford an apartment."

3841,Thoughts of a depressed college student,"I feel done, I can't go on anymore. There's so many people that love me and I'm not broke or am homeless and I feel like such an ungrateful piece of shit for still dealing with these thoughts. I hate myself so much and I wish I could just get into a car wreck or have a terminal illness so I wouldn't let anyone down for taking my own life. I have an amazing girlfriend who would do anything for me and lovely parents but I still deal with major depressive disorder and nothing seems to be working. I can't go back to the doctor or check myself into a mental health clinic because I don't have health insurance and my professors are so done with my shit. I'm just so tired"
3842,There isn't a point anymore.,"I cant take the pressure of life anymore. I'm procrastinating too much. I cant handle it. I have a ton of things I have to do and I cant be bothered to do them. The deadline is around the corner. I had to be moved to home study because I didnt want to be around people. 

I just want to talk to someone."
3843,Death,Ugh i really want to kill myself like right now but since it's so soon until Christmas I don't want to put that burden on my family and if I fail and don't die I don't want to draw attention to myself either. Can the 25th just be here already and be over cause every day I'm just existing not living.
3844,No one cares about me,"I really want to kill myself I bought paracetamol yesterday and I can’t fight the urges to keep taking it

No one cares about me I think that after I die people might be sad for a little bit but then they’ll get over it and be happy that I’m gone. I can’t stop hyperventilating and making myself throw up (it’s not even working) I feel so weak right now 

I only have one person that I’ve opened up to but he doesn’t care about me. He pretend that he cares and he tells me he cares about me but I know that he doesn’t 

I don’t what to do I can’t even kill myself I’m living with a friend at the moment I don’t want her to come home to a dead body I don’t know what to do

3845,Reasons for suicide that nobody understands,"Can someone write in the comments reasons what reasons someone (not nescessary you, though it'd be appreciated as well) have to kill themselves that nobody understands.

I'm not talking about reasons like being survivor of rape, or bullying, or losing a loved one. I'm talking about reasons that the majority of people wouldn't consider the ones that could drive anyone to suicide."
3846,A Work Friend Killed Himself,"It’s weird, we were friends when we worked together, I still have his number. But we hadn’t talked since we both quit about a year ago. 

A month and a half ago I happened upon a missing person report and it was him, three days later his mom posted on Facebook that he had taken his own life. 

This is the first time that someone I knew killed themself. And I mean, we hadn’t talked or seen each other for a long time.

When I saw the missing persons report and then found out he was dead, suicide literally didn’t cross my mind. Like there wasn’t anything in me that suspected he’d killed himself. But then I found out it was suicide later. 

I’m pretty desensitized to death, when I was 12 my brother died in a hay ride accident, my cousin died when he was three, my other cousin died when she was 7, my grandmother and uncle both passed away.  It’s safe to say that I’m pretty good with handling grief, I know the process and I can work through it. All of these deaths have been people very close to me. 

But for some reason this work friend killing himself has just stuck with me. I will literally think about him randomly all the time. I hadn’t thought about him once in the year that I hadn’t seen him, but now so much reminds me of him and every time I think about him there’s just this emptiness inside of me that I don’t understand. 

Is it normal for suicides to be so different from other deaths? My brother died on a hay ride that I was on, my cousin had brain cancer, my other cousin had heart problems, my uncle was paralyzed and just overall in bad health, and my grandma had a stroke. With all of these deaths I was able to grieve and not move on, but come to an understanding of sorts. I’m at peace inside of myself about these deaths. However, this suicide has really messed with me. 

I guess I’m just looking for help understanding this feeling. And finding ways to overcome it?"
3847,Never enough,"Well reddit it was fun while it lasted i was fairly new here and i made some great friends, but today i just got the news i’ve been cheated on again and by my own best friend. Living alone has its perks. No one will find me until it’s time to pay rent. Goodbye reddit i love all of you"
3848,I’m going to kill myself,"I’ve been suicidal for years but I’ve finally decided that I’m just going to kill myself. 

I have no reason to be here. No one wants me anymore. I’ve just been waiting to see if things would get better but they don’t."
3849,I think about it a lot,"I’d rent a hotel room, listen to music, slash my arms. I’m comfortable with that kind of pain, used to it. It’s the one method that doesn’t make me feel queasy. I’m just afraid of being unsuccessful. If I truly attempt, I want it to work. One of these days. I’m so sorry."

3852,I destroyed my life,"I had a loving husband and have two beautiful children but it wasn't enough.  I have been severely depressed for years,  most mornings I wake up disappointed that I didn't die in my sleep. I have been acting out for months and hurting my husband but I can't stop. I feel guilty for feeling this way when I have my kids.
Last week I cheated on my husband,  he has left and we are set to lose our home and due to his reaction when he found out then he will probably end up with a criminal conviction and lose his job. The kids were taken into Foster Care and now we are under review as a family. Despite all of this he says that he will stay my friend and we will work as a team for the kids.
It's not enough,  I just want my family back. The constant desire to die has now become an active research into passive suicide.  The only reason that I am still here tonight is because of my kids but they will only need me for so long. I am trying so hard to stay in control but the only way I can stop the tears is to self harm and even the worry that the social will find out doesn't stop me.

3854,No reason to exist anymore,"Ever since a year ago I've been on a rapid decline in mental health. When I met him, I felt like I finally found the love of my life. We dated for 6 months, and each day was better than the last. The week summer started, we went to a party. We broke off when we entered the house and we did our own things. I thought I could trust him. I was looking for him everywhere when we had to leave. I called him. Texted him. Asked our mutual friends if they'd seen him. After almost everyone left, I found him in the master bedroom with 3 other woman in the same bed. I broke down in front of him. I couldn't hear anything, or see anything. I felt the thumps of the woman running out of the room. A mutual friend, Britney, ran up and saw the scene we were in. She helped me up and brought me to her truck and drove me home. I threw myself into my bed and tried to stop crying but nothing worked. He was constantly trying to text me and call me but I didn't want to see his name anymore. After the silent treatment didn't work I showed him what that traumatic experience did to me. I tried slicing my wrists lengthways but I didn't have the guts to. I sent him an image of what I tried doing and then blocked him. A large group of our friends started texting me and telling me how much of a piece of shit I am and that I deserve to die. They brought my mother into this. They told my mother what I did to myself. They told her that I was dating another guy. I became alone. No friends. No family. When I finally met someone else they did the exact. Same. Thing. But this time I didn't feel anything. I expected nothing better from this world. I'm finally going to have peace. Away from the evil of this fucking world.  I didn't just want to disappear, that's why I'm posting this. Don't do what I did. Don't act out in anger or sadness. Don't become me. I loved what I had when I had it. But it's not going to get better. I'm not worthy of having love anyway, not even I can love myself. Goodbye"

3858,How some redditer saved my life,"Im pretty sure I deleted the last post but I’m not sure. In summary, around a week ago maybe I decided that enough was enough, I’d had enough with the loneliness, the numbness and all that shit and decided that I was gonna kill myself. I decided to post on here and had already taken some paracetamol (I think it was paracetamol anyway) and was about to write out a suicide note and take the rest of the parecetamol when a notification on my phone distracted me and almost snapped me out of it

I can’t remember his user but he had measaged me giving me his number and telling me I can message him whenever to talk about things and so I decided it wouldn’t hurt to talk to him. But I told him everything about why I was going to kill myself and a that shit and he talked me out of it and calmed me down, talking to me for hours until he knew I wasn’t going to do anything stupid.

He pretty much saved my life that night. I had nothing to live for anymore and I was at an all time low but hey, I’m still alive so it’s okay. I kinda became inactive on most social media’s for a while afterwards so I’m sorry to anyone I scared or who thought I was dead. 

Don’t get me wrong I still want to kill myself but the difference is that I’m not going to (yet) but if anyone is going through hard times then I’m always here :) x"
3859,Hanging from the ceiling fan,"I am alone. I have tied a rope to the ceiling fan in this room and have prepared the noose. My neck is in it. I am sitting on this chair. 
Thinking. Floating perhaps. Crying. Gut wrenching cry. A grown 30 year old so called 'man'. Bawling. 
Why me? Why? And i know the answer: because i am worthless piece of shit, a wastrel of a human being, a pathetic piece of being.

I laughed at my own pathetic condition. And now i cry. 

My maa would not be able to see my dead body. My paa would be heartbroken to his core of existence. My little brother will be desolate.I know this will happen.

But i also know that if i do not take this step right now, i will be a burden on them for the rest of this life. I will be the reason of their pain, constant endless pain. So, why not end the reason of their pain and mine as well. 

That's me. I feel and i know that if i am out of their lives, they would so much more 'happy'. May be not now. May be not for sometime after i am gone. But surely after a period of time, they will be atleast unburdened from me, from my sorrows, from my endless turmoil.

After a point of time, time will heal everyone who had known me a liitle. I will gradually be erased from their memories. Slowly. But still. 

Life is fleeting. Life is chaotic. Life is nothing without a career. Career is not made without any skill. 
Skill which i don't have, for which i have failed to even try to get it because i failed miserably. 
I don't see the point of my existence. 

Yes, i am a coward. I am a loser. I am and will remain an abject failure of a being. I don't have even an ounce of energy to go any further. Their is no point to it. The chair will fall now in another 5 mins.

Bye."
3860,I need help,"I quit heroin recently and I’d rather die than go back to it, but ever since I quit I’ve been anxious ever second of every day, and I get hit with these times when I feel so lost that all I can think about it killing myself. My life was looking pretty decent before I quit, I have all sorts of connections in the drug buisness because I used to be a dealer so the dope was never expensive, and I spent so much time numb that I forgot why I even started in the first place. Right before I quit I managed to get a girl that had her shit together and I started making lots more meaningful connections with friends. However, I wasn’t really going anywhere with my life. I’m 17 and live with my parents right now and I’ve never got a legitamate legal job, and my parents arn’t going to let me live under their roof forever. So in an effort to better myself, I went out and joined the army, and got one of the most exclusive contracts there is that would set me up for life. I’m scheduled to ship out in 37 days to become an army diver. I seriously can’t think of any other job I would want besides that. The dilema was that I had to quit doing drugs because they drug test, so in an effort to get an early start I dumped about $300 worth of heroin and other opiates down the toilet. Ever since then its just been a downward spiral. I can’t control my emotions, and every night I just want to end it all. I’m on edge all the time because I’m not ready to let go of everyone back at home, but I know I have to take this opprotunity. This will not only give me a job I love for the next 5 years, but it will set me up for a commercial diving carrear for life, if I can survive the next 37 days without doing anything stupid. When I’m laying in bed at night feeling like I have no chance at being happy, I know that if I were to call my girlfriend she would know exactly what to say, and she would just help it all go away, but I’m too scared. I havn’t asked for help like that in years, and I don’t want to dump all my shit on her and strain tf out of the relationship, but at the same time I feel like I need to bring it up or else this is gonna be the thing that causes me either to relapse or self harm or end it. What do I do? Should I ask her for help, and if so how tf do I go about that without destroying the relationship and making myself look like a needy bitch?"
3861,Tired,"I’m just tired of everything. I’m tired of not having a single friend. I just found out recently that the people who I thought I was friends with hate me. They were making fun of me in a separate group chat for well over a year. If that wasn’t enough, I’m tired of engineering classes just killing me. I don’t even know what to do at this point. I’m just weary. Sorry for the rant but this just hurts.

I hope all of you at least have a good day. I’ll be honest, mine has been pretty terrible."
3862,last post,"I am so pathetic, that in the course of 72 hours, not a single person on this planet decided that they wanted to talk to me. Not one person was compelled to say hello. I've been lonely all my life, and I'm just so tired of it. I'm so tired of feeling alone. I'm so tired of wanting to be wanted. I'm so tired. It's no one's fault. People are the way they are. Robin Williams ended his life despite having had something I long for. The ability to make others happy. Maybe that's his essence, and mine is my undesirability. But, if he found no respite surrounded by such joy- then what hope have I? I can either run away from my nature and try and change, or accept my miserable life for what it will be as I continue down a path I have not been able to really leave no matter how hard I try. No matter how many things I learn, no matter how many times I try to grow in some respect, I find myself back here. Alone. Unwanted. Uncared for. Selfishly wanting these things. Shamefully wanting these things as there are surely those who would wish to be in my position- but maybe not. Maybe the same way I repel everyone I've tried to be close to, I'd repel any considerations of life in my shoes. It's no one's fault. I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry that I leave only a legacy of spite, and hate. I don't want to hurt you, but it simply hurts too much."

I’m moving soon, and supposed to be planning a wedding. It feels like everything is just stacking up and up and up and it’s about to fall right on top of me. 

I can’t talk to anyone about it, because it’s not as important as anything else that’s going on. I’m terrified to see yet another therapist, and meds are incredibly difficult. 

I’m at a loss, and i know ending things would be easier for me to handle. I’ve gotten close before but whimped out, but now I’m not sure I even have the strength to stay anymore"
3864,I just want to die,"It’s a long story. My girlfriend/partner of 13 years doesn’t want me anymore. We went to therapy and things got better. Our therapist went on maternity leave and things got worse. We had our first session back today and my girlfriend said she doesn’t think she wants to have a romantic relationship anymore. She may not come to our next session. I just don’t know what to do. We made so much good progress. We had a small fight and I know I said hurtful things, but nothing too bad, I though. I wish I could change it. It changed overnight. She got so depressed and stopped taking her medication. I’m in bed now. I cried to my mom all day afterwards. I just want to die. I tried to kill myself last year and thankfully woke up. I’m not back there again yet, but I just wish something would kill me through the night. I pray she’s not really done with me yet."
3865,i woke up half an hour ago,"I attempted to overdose nearly two hours ago, I was out for a while and just woke up

Im tired, Im so tired I cant do another day"
3866,I ruined my own life,"In the 1990's, my grandmother was dying of alzheimer's disease and it created a metric shit ton of drama in the family, but I was very young at the time so I didn't have a good idea about what was happening. To sum it all up, my uncle is the only one who did the right thing but his three brothers (including my father) were the sleaze-balls who made it look like they were the saints and he was the devil. After all this happened, no one saw this particular uncle for awhile because he basically left the family due to how he and his wife had been treated. 

Fast forward to 2013 and I had the opportunity to meet this uncle and he started to talk like he'd take me under his wing and help me get out on my own during college and afterwards. Looking back on it, he was just manipulating me to get back at his brother (my father) and absolutely none of the promises he made ever came true. He followed through on exactly none of what he said he would do to help me get away from my parents who were holding me back in many ways. 

Fast forward again to the present day, and my situation is far worse than if I had not gone to college at all. I'm stuck in the shitty job I went to college to avoid, and a week ago the self-excommunicated uncle had the balls to basically tell me that he knew my choice of college was a stupid decision but he let me make it anyways because he does everything in his power to avoid participating in my life, other than destroying my self-esteem and confidence whenever he gets the chance. He was really good at keeping my hopes up when I first met him. He was always a bit of a hard-ass, but he'd give me gas money to get to and from his house and always invited me back whenever I had a chance to come see him. I seriously thought for many years that he would start acting like a relative and help me move towards my goals and dreams. 

But at this point, I don't see how I'm going to recover from being run hard and put up wet. I don't have any connections, college was mostly a disaster, and the only income I have is from my awful job on night shift because my parents have never been well-off. That's one reason why I was trying to kiss this uncle's ass, is because I have always been depressingly poor and I've never had a comfortable lifestyle where I didn't have to worry much about money.

Everything opportunity I have pursued lately has fallen apart as soon as it was about to work out, like a sand castle that gets knocked by a wave over as soon as you start adding details. I feel completely hopeless and hollow, and I'm almost 25 at this point. I met this uncle when I was 17 and the drama from the 90's resurfaced just in time for my senior year of highschool. I should have stayed away from him, but I was completely desperate for a way out of my problems that I was willing to spend time with someone who was not likely to ever love and support me like a relative should. How the hell am I going to get back on track at this point? The idea of dying scares me because tomorrow might be sunnier than today, but sometimes suicide seems like such an enticing option because I can't find relief anywhere."
3868,[18F] i don't know where to go from here,"(i made a post here earlier but i still have a lot on my chest that i need to get off before it eats away at me and i can't tell anybody else really because i already scared a lot of my friends last night without meaning to. this is kind of long but bear with me)

at this point in time, i feel that i contribute absolutely nothing important to the world and never will. since graduating i have absolutely no idea what i want to do with my life, what i want to study in school, and i am currently going through an extreme personality crisis. i used to be extremely into art and would make collages, paintings, zines and comic books regularly but at this point i see no point. i have had mentors and peers say some rather disparaging things to me about my work and at this point its just not fun and i don't enjoy it anymore. ever since i was a kid, i wanted to study film and video production but at this point i'm not even going to bother.

i was extremely close to moving to olympia, washington for college (for context, i live all the way on the other side of the country so it would be a far move) but after my grandmother passed this spring and my parents separated, i decided i needed to stay back home. in my state, the first two years of community college are free as long as you attend right after graduation...and i didn't do it. and now my family loves to remind me of how badly i fucked up. and how i shouldve never taken a break because it wasn't like i was ever going to do anything productive, anyways. my father even told me regularly that he didn't even think i was going to graduate high school. 

i still haven't gotten a job because i need to get my ID and nobody will take me. i feel like a lazy piece of shit and i hate the person that i have become. i understand why most of my friends don't really want to hang out with me these days

i feel like i am a burden to my friends and i feel like shit whenever i run to them looking for comfort because i don't like using my friends for free therapy. i just feel so alone and need to let everything out and there are very few people i am willing to share this with.

the person i love says he can't be with me right now and i am afraid i have done something wrong or just wasn't good enough. he is still my best friend, but when we were together i genuinely had never felt that much happiness in my life in a really long time. realistically, i know this is probably just because we were long distance and only got to see each other twice in the span of a few months, but i can't seem to shake the feeling that i have pushed him away even though he has even told me i didn't. i am considering moving to where he is so we can still hang out and i also just need to get away from everything and leave my past life behind. i genuinely believe this would help me and while i dont think i will ever stop feeling suicidal, i think being able to start a new life in a new place will help me heal to an extent. i would want to cut out most of my family except for my mom, aunt, cousins, and a few extended family members and keep in touch with my friends. even just dreaming about this and saving up my money is enough to make me feel a little better.

i've also been thinking a lot about my past traumas and just how hard i've had it my entire life. as i said in my last post, the first time i remember feeling suicidal was when i was in the 6th grade, just 11. i remember telling my friends during recess that i wish i had been aborted and didn't want to be alive and that is the first memory i have of ever feeling that way. i can say that i still feel the same way at 18. i don't think i ever really realized just how bad things were until just a few years ago.

 lately i have been considering lots of unhealthy things, such as hurting myself physically, sneaking alcohol and just drinking until i cant remember anything, or just not caring about myself and having reckless sex with whoever. i have enough self control to an extent but the fact alone that i even think about that kind of stuff is alarming for me because i can't control it.

i know many people say they don't want to die, they just want to end the suffering - i genuinely want both. i'm not going to attempt anything right now but i have come close quite a few times. i hope things will start looking up for me and maybe i won't feel so hurt soon but i think that's unlikely. i have not lived a very nice or easy life and i don't think that will be different anytime soon. i do not have a sense of stability in my life currently and very little to live for. the only thing that stops me from ending everything is my best friend, my other friends, my mom, and my 15 year old cousin who looks up to me greatly. i'm just tired of letting everyone down, that's all"
3869,Done,I must be fucked in the head or something (obviously) but I get unreasonably angry at stuff I like cause I can't keep focus on jack shit then cause I can't focus I don't feel the need to pursue anything cause why TF should I I won't apply myself cause my dogshit head won't cooperate even if I go to college I'm 25 a quarter of my life gone max I'm out of shape bitter full of hate for everyone and everything cause the one thing I'm good at is convincing myself that shit won't get good decent or anything life is pain but I don't wanna put burden on my family since my mom died 2 months ago were poor and me dying would just put more stress on my family I mean I could be more productive but why I'll die alone cause no one wants a total loser piece of shit idk how I got here but I give up that's it nothing left to do but wait to die I guess cause nothing else going for me college would be a waste cause I'll ruin it for myself some how always do I could get a better job to what wait till I'm 60 to do stuff alone? I wish life could be worth living but this ain't Disneyland life fucking blows or I blew it idk but fuck this bullshit
3870,How to get through suicidal thoughts/intentions or when you want to hurt yourself,"&amp;#x200B;

# When you're having a crisis or thinking on hurting yourself the thing that really help is giving it a set time. Like a minute or a hour, a day or month or a year (you choose). If you still want to kill/hurt yourself at the end of that time you can say ok i will do it... but when that set time comes you need to tink, I was a WHOLE minute or hour or day or year fighting and that's a lot. That's a victory in its own way, so you can say more confident if i can go through the double of the time and still want to ending it all i will do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I been doing it since i have 16, now i have 25 and there is no day in what i don't think on killing myself, but hey, i'm still fighting even if i dont have any reason to do it. And I'm willing to give my best to help other people who have this illness too... 

If you want to be heard please talk to me, I dont judge and I will try my best to understand you.

Please reach for some **help**, please **don't hurt yourself,** please **don't kill yourself** and please just if you can listen or give some love to other person who needs it.

**Take a hand and give a hand when you can.** 

I know we can make it through."

3876,Post attempt TRIGGER WARNING,"    You know, just yesterday I would’ve sworn I wasn’t suicidal. Sworn that I have control. Sworn that I didn’t even want to die but last night I attempted. I was drunk, the rest of the night was blackout up until part of the attack on my wrists and the moment after i took the ibuprofen and midol. 4000 mgs. The symptoms of overdosing are still strong. 


       I am a self harmer but I never /// on my wrists because that’s dangerous and I  wasn’t suicidal I thought. Last night i covered my wrists but was too drunk to //// very deep.


     I’m not sure if I did damage to my internal organs. When I first woke up I had no control of my balance. Other symptoms were, really bad chills and shaking,dizziness, hard to breathe, stomach hurting horribly, panic, cramping, sweating while still cold, then later heat flashes. I was in and out of sleep all night and half the day.  Still experiencing most of these symptoms.

     My mom isn’t worried because I said I have a hangover. My girlfriend ,which I have a deep connection to, knew something was wrong despite no clues and snapped me asking if i had a really bad nightmare or something. To which I replied, “not a nightmare, way worse that that. I can’t tell you because I feel you will tell someone out of fear for me. Im sorry”


       I need support from them but i know they will tell my mom and she’ll freak out and probably cry.

        So how do I feel? Horrible. I hope I don’t die. I don’t even know what triggered me to try to kill myself, all I know is in that moment I did want to die.  Y’all can say go to the doctor all day but I’m not doing that. My dad could get the records and then get custody on the bassist that I “attempted suicide because she’s miserable at her moms” no he gave me ptsd. He gave me anxiety. He gave me depression. Now he could be the reason I die from some type of organ failure.


     Does this even count as an attempt? I mean I was drunk and my sober brain knows how unlikely it is for ibuprofen to kill me. The //// on my wrists weren’t very deep."

3879,I have no purpose in life. When is it time to give up?," 

This is a bit long so bare with me. So im a 29 year old female. ive had a very tough life to the point where i wouldnt be surprised in the slightest if someone told me i was cursed. Ill give you some info on somethings i have dealt/dealing with.

I cannot work ( a story for another time), i do not get money from state or anything ( havent tried and do not plan to), i have some health issues, have major depression, anxiety, and PTSD from things that have happened in my life. Pretty much i have gone through more in my life so far than many people go through in their entire life. I wouldn't wish my enemies that pain, hurt, and struggle i have to deal with. Hell if i had money things still wouldnt get better. Okay well some things would but money can't solve everything.

I have insomnia and i do not remember the last time i have had a good nights sleep, ive been on many insomnia meds over the years and my body gets use to them quickly. The doctor said "" there is nothing left to try"" when i asked to try a new sleep med because the last ones i had stopped working. That was a few years ago. I have permanent 24/7 headaches/migraines that do not go away and doctors do not know why but they refuse to do a brain scan due to ?? Been dealing with horrible headache pain since 2013. Sometimes they get so bad i can barely function.

I have no friends anymore, i got tired of being treated like shit adn taken advantage of and dropped everyone. Which is probably a good thing to be honest. I enjoy helping people and people know that, so i was taken advantage of easily.  
I have no family except my father and he spends all his time treating me like shit trying to get me to kill myself, its been like this my entire life. Hes an cruel man that is an abusive psycho path. His threats are endless. My last ex was very abusive and almost killed me a few times, but hell im still here.  
My mom actually killed me as a baby but i was saved by doctors. Im not sure how long i was dead. I happened to die while she was at a forced dr appointment. Forced by who or how? I am not sure.  
Before anyone says anything... No, i do not go to therapy, it doesn't work for me and always backfires. For instance, apparently its my fault that i was molested for years starting in preschool. Yeah you read that right.

I think because i died...I'm taking up space in the world that was meant for someone else. Basically... I wasnt suppose to be here but i was saved and have lived a horrible life due to it. Yes that is a crazy belief but if you knew all i have went through , you would understand why I think that. I guess trying to find a reason in all the bad luck.  
I think because im not suppose to be here; i am tested daily to see if ill finally give in and grow a pair to hang myself. I am not religious by any means for reasons i feel arent important to talk about.

I wasnt able to go to college, another long story. Hell i got a lot of long stories.  
And it is impossible to go to college( poor and cannot get aid or loans), and because i cant work it wouldnt matter anyway if i had a degree cuz it would be useless.  
My boyfriend works two jobs, mainly because he had to get a new car and the payment is high. But it kills me not being able to bring money into the house. I have sold off most of my things over the years. I dont really have anything left. I do make money time to time making things to sell or what not when I can but its rare. I was able to make a little bit of money recently on a few sales and was able to do the reddit secret santa thing this year. First time. I was hoping id be able to make someone smile with a gift for christmas. My boyfriend was not upset that i did this. I actually made myself upset because i felt even though i didnt make a lot of money, that i still could have put it towards a bill. My boyfriend said "" It's your money and you rarely make money and i love you even more knowing that the little money you did get, you decided to use to give a stranger a gift in hopes of giving someone a smile. Never change who you are. This is one of the reasons i love you."" He is a great guy and loves me but i know he could do so much better!

The last few months things have been pretty clear to me, i have no purpose.  
I am literally a waste of space and i have nothing to contribute to the world. I have no purpose and its just making me realize theres no reason to be here.  
Ive given up on my dreams as they are unreachable. All of them unless of course i win the lottery. With that being said i should probably buy a ticket huh? As i said before though. money still wouldnt solve everything.

What is the point of living if all you do is exist? Hell all the trash humans create on earth and im just alive making more trash not being able to contribute to help with anything. Not having a car thats reliable and hell dangerous to drive even. I can't even volunteer places because i don't have the means to get from point A to point B. Living around nothing doesnt help. I like to make people happy but hell, i cant even give or donate because i don't have the means to do so. I am not able to do the most simplest thing. Its heartbreaking. I cant even donate blood because i cant get to a donation place. Something so simple, so simple and i cannot even achieve that. There are no busses where i am , and i couldnt afford that anyway. I'm thankful i am able to have a cell phone and a roof over my head. But i have no purpose, there is no reason for me to be alive. There truly isnt. I guess im posting to see if anyone else sees this too.

And as i sit here, acknowledging that i have no purpose and am just a waste, i ask myself, "" When is enough enough? When is it time to give up? Do i just sit here and try to move forward knowing things wont get better?  
When is it time to say goodbye and give up?"" I ask these questions daily.  
Oh and before you bring up optimism. I use to be very optimistic trying to move forward in my life, until a life altering event happened few years back.  
Sorry for typos.

3883,"Someone I love tried to kill themselves, who can I talk to?","This is going to be a rambling wall of text and I apologize for that.

My long distance girlfriend (F21) and I (M24) have been on a break for just under 3 months, we had issues to work out and have been focusing on ourselves to build independence and confidence. I don't want to talk about that really, it was incredibly difficult for me and we are very close to getting back together (under a week).

However, last night she called me at 3 am about something her friend had done, they have an incredibly toxic relationship and she will treat my GF like shit until she needs something from her and then they're thick as thieves again.

She places almost all of her value as a person on how this friend thinks of her and when this happens she calls or texts me about how she has no friends and everyone hates her, and that she is a burden to anyone close to her. She uses the examples of her friend as well as what she's ""done"" to me with how hard this break has been for me.

She has so many friends besides the toxic one, she has so many people who care about her and love her but all she cares about is what her friend thinks of her. It's made even more difficult because they are roommates, she can't put distance between herself and her friend.

I'm posting here because in the middle of our call she said she had ""almost done something"" the last time they were in a fight (3 weeks ago). I pressed a little bit and she admitted she wanted to commit suicide and the only reason she didn't was me and her family. I'm incredibly scared as I am not there to help and since we are still on a break I want to give her space that she needs. This being said, the break has pushed her closer to this friend and I'm starting to think it's no longer helping her.

But I can't do nothing, and I don't know if I need to tell someone, I checked the risk guide but I didn't press on if she had a plan or was just thinking about it and I'm scared talking further about it will make her focus on it more and try. So I don't know if it counts as an immediate threat. I want to show her how much she means to everyone else, I have never dealt with anything like this and I am honestly so scared."
3884,Im so close to ending it all,Im so tired of my mom being against me over every little thing. I dont want trouble with the damn law but apparently having a breakdown everyday and arguing is a crime but my mom constantly hitting me and my dad isn’t. I’m at my limit. I don’t care anymore. My family doesn’t care about me so why should i keep going. I wished i was loved and had a functioning family.
3885,it is either in 2021 or 2028 i have to script it if nothing ever gets better anyways.,no point in my opinion to rotate or wasting any other time to expect something to get into that could rather change my mind or be good to see and there is no future to see on the path i'm looking at because all it is are a bunch of broken promises because there's no clear reason to still continue on if it isn't for those expectation that are rather blind or pointless at all tbh then again living sucks and this planet sucks too reasons are none ofc.
3886,I wanna fucking kill myself,I wanna kill myself so bad right now please someone just do it for me just end me please shoot my brains out or something anything at all
3887,Sorry if my post triggered anybody last night,"That's pretty much it, it's been deleted. Take care everyone"
3888,Lost,"Hey guys, I'm not really deppressed right now. I'm very anxious though but I'm always anxious like 24/7. Anxiety is still a horrible feeling I'm tired of feeling.

I still really want to die right now. I could just hang myself tonight but I want a painless method. It's so hard to find a method online and it's even harder to find someone to answer my questions.

I want to leave this life and go on to whatever. My mom says if I do kill myself I'm going straight to hell, I don't care though because I'm already in hell. I don't know what's after life but I do know it isn't just going to be dark forever for me. I don't want to stay here. I'm scared of being an adult now sense I'm 18. I don't want to be an adult.

I have alot of reasons why I want to kill myself. I already have my suicide note ready I wrote months ago, I edit it every once in a while.

I'm just so lost and confused."
3889,Whats the fucking point,
3890,Suicide note and stuff,"Should you actually be worried about yourself when you wrote a suicide note/letter?
I wouldn't consider myself being realistically suicidal, but I think about it everyday, plus I wrote a suicide note/letter like 3 times when I was drunk asf when I tried to drink my worries and pain about my other mental issues away.
Can I even consider myself suicidal without an actual attempt or further plan on how to do it?"
3891,I'm going to do it,"This refers to my last post about killing myself on the 19th. After this week, I now know that I can't keep on living like this. I can't go on another year with things slowly getting worse. I'm too tired to try and fix the unfixable. I've tried but it just didn't work out I'm not cut out for this."
3892,I don’t think I’ll be here much longer,"And that is because i am a disgusting human being. Please don’t try to tell me otherwise. Abusers, especially emotional abusers, deserve no sympathy and neither do I. 

I somehow managed to go from being a hero in someone’s life to being the worst of villains. I don’t think there’s anything more I can do but end my life. I can’t do anything to repair the damage I have caused, as that would make me a hypocrite. I can’t move on as I will always be reminded of what I did. 

My mental health issues, autism and learning disabilities are no excuse for being an abuser. I have no right to be here any longer. The universe was testing me and I failed. I have no other options. I need to die. 

To everyone who’s reached out to me before, you are good people and I appreciate your concern for me, but I’m not worth your time or your love; you should save it for the many good people in this world who will improve and learn and reciprocate your love. I am a bad man. I do not deserve love, because I cannot give it anymore. 

This might be my last post. I’m sorry. I’m leaving this world soon. Please don’t forgive me. Forget me. I’m no good."
3893,A strange anxious feeling,"Today I started the day feeling irritated and numb.. and kind of suicidal. then when I got back home from shopping I slowly started feeling anxious and i dunno what that means. I do know one thing, its trying to tell me that theres still at least one small thing i want to live for (but i dont exactly know what it is).  i also had a considerable amount of beer so i might just be over thinking. cant tell if slightly drunk or just straigt up anxious. 

i want to sleep this off. lets see where the rest of this lonely day brings me."
3894,I tried my best,I’m at peace with my decision because I know I’ve tried my best to change things for the better but didn’t succeed because I’m unfixable. I’ve a perfect plan to end this miserable existence in few days.
3895,I was told to open up,So I'm looking for someone to talk to. Anyone is okay
3896,I want to Die,"But I don't want to kill myself. I know that people would miss etc. But still, live is more of a chore at this point"
3897,sad and suicidal,
3898,I don't want to go on,"It's all too much.  I'm living 2 hours away from my family and I feel so lonely.  I feel like a lost cause.  I've failed almost every class in my college studies.  I'm running out of financial aid, so I may not even be able to finish my degree if I don't fail out first.  I lost my job.  I have so many health issues.  I can't handle a physical job.  But the only thing I'm qualified for is minimum wage entry-level fast food.  I've applied at every desk job and fast-food job and no one is calling me back.  No job wants me.  I feel trapped in my marriage since I'm financially dependent on him, and he's the only person I know in this new area. He treats me well enough, and I know he loves me, but I would never be able to secure another relationship. He would be devastated if I divorced him. He'd handle being a widow easier. I'm not ""pretty"", I'm extremely overweight, I'me worthless, and I'm chronically depressed and I don't think anyone else could deal with my bullshit. No one would want me. We almost didn't have enough to pay rent last month, and that was with the job I just lost.  I don't know how we are going to keep paying rent now that I've fucked up too bad. I can't afford therapy, and even when I could, it never helped.  It made me feel like more of a burden.  I'm ready for it all to end.  I feel bad cause I know he won't be able to handle paying the bills on his own, but at least he'll have less food to have to buy. He won't have as many of those bills, so maybe he could. He can move back near his parents.  They'll help him.  He'll be back near his friends and he could sign back on at the only job he loved. He'll be happier.  I know my pets will be taken care of.  My parents love that damn cat so much. The dog would have a yard to run and play in again.  I've got those sleeping pills that my doctor gave me for insomnia.  If I take those, maybe no one would question it.  I went to sleep and didn't wake up. That happens all the time right? No one would find me covered in my own blood, I wouldn't destroy the only car we have.  It would be easier for someone to find."
3899,im tired,"all i want is to go to sleep and not wake up. i wanted someone to hear me, but i scream and i scream and nobody hears me from this glass box im in so its hopeless. no one really understands, no matter how much they try. 

im tired, im hungry but i cant eat because the more i eat the fatter and uglier i get, my hobbies and my art dont make me happy anymore, my body is fucked, my brain is fucked, my family is fucked and no matter where i go it feels like nobody fucking hears me and nobody understands me and there's nowhere i can go where i don't feel looming judgment and disdain swinging over my head like a sword on a string. 

i want to apologize to my friends, my partner, and my father but no one wants my apologies and i dont blame them. my apologies are almost as worthless as i am. 

i want to kill myself but im afraid of pain, ive got no more pills, i dont know where my dad keeps his gun, i dont want to destroy my car and fuck over my father's finances even more and excuses, excuses, excuses, motherfucking excuses. 

everything is empty and i want to sleep. but i keep waking up."
3900,Have you ever seen the sun in a gloomy day?,"It's 4.30 AM for me. I've been awaken for the whole night, watching some movies and waiting to fall asleep. It doesn't work well, apparently.

I turned 17 yesterday. No one remembered, as usual. No parties, no gifts, not a single word. Fine, I guess that's who I am in people's eyes.

I've final tests next week. Still, I can't seem to focus and get anything done. Brain doesn't function well when the depression strikes. It's like my IQ got halved.

I've been in a two-month contest. No pressure, it's just my last chance. And I'm falling behind, feeling hopeless and not knowing what to do next. It's like being panic, and not having anything done.

I'm about to be at home. Alone, for a month. It's kinda fine, I'm used to it, but it still sucks when it's Christmas. Hopefully loneliness won't push me over the edge and commit suicide, because there will be no one to stop or save me.

And, I don't have any friends to share it. No one is closed enough, and it feels a bit frustrating to tell the whole story to strangers. Some cares but can't understand, some listen but don't care, some just don't reply at all.

It's freezing cold, and I dress pretty much nothing. I still wonder why I don't catch flu, common cold or anything more serious. At least that's a way to go.

I tried to commit suicide last night by blocking blood flow to my head, passed out and slept til my mom woke me up. No consequences, no one knows. Even the Death refuses me, how lucky I am...

So yeah, what a way to get old. I think I'm a coward, feeling depressed because of those little things. Being 17 makes people expect you to be mature and behave like a grown up man. That's life, I guess?"
3901,How do I deal with guilt after an attempt?,"I have tried to kill myself a few times now. But i would say that my last attept was the most ""serious."" I did it july 26, a friday night. I took a lot of meds and slit my forarms open. Of course it didnt work. My family was home at the time i did it. I did it in the bathroom, and after i realized that i wouldn't die, i called out for my twin brother (we're both 21) for help. He saw the mess of blood everywhere and my open arms. He helped me put bandages on, and he was the one who called 911. He even helped me stay conscious when i started to doze off. My whole family was home. My older bro was mad, my mom was calling my dad, and my little sister had locked herself in her room. Out everyone, I mostly feel bad for twin.  It was him who found and read my note. It was him who cleaned up the bathroom all by himself after wards.

I feel so guilty for putting him through that. No one should have to clean their sister's blood of the ground. He's told me that i shouldn't be sorry and that it's okay, but it wasnt okay. I dont know how to deal with this. I think i deserve to feel bad."
3902,I am unsure,"I am 16 y/o boy from Russia and I want to hang myself. I think it all began when my parents started yelling at me. Im in 9th grade and I’ll have to have exams this year. The thing is that I strongly believe I won’t have a good life after school(Im leaving it this year ‘cause Im not smart enough to study in 10 &amp; 11).

On 2nd of October I had something like a birthday party. Every single guest noticed that I didn’t smile at all, when I myself never knew that. There were 2 guests only.

From then on I began looking at how many times I smiled. 6 times because of the jokes and that’s it.

Earlier some people from reddit helped me. That was awesome and I felt better but for an extremely short while. 

Last year I cut my left arm all the time and I have scars. This year Im bitting my fingers like every second.

Im not sure what should I do. Im not sure if I even have any problems. These might be everyones ‘Problems’ that are usual. And Im not sure if I should continue living

Sorry for wasting your time!"
3903,"I took 15 Tylenol and all of my lexapro, approximately 30 pills","Above post, I’m done"
3904,I should be gone by tonight. I really hope I am,"I've planned everything out and I'm ready to go and get out of this stupid miserable fucking existence.

Bipolar has completely ruined my life and nothing is getting any better day by day. Everyday is the fucking same pain.

If I go tonight that's all my problems solved, gone, vanished."
3905,I am worried that I am in the process of losing everyone and everything,"Day to day I really struggle with being motivated. I am currently a sophomore in college and extremely uncertain about my future. I am probably changing my major this week which may help me feel motivated, but I just don’t see any potential in life. Even if things do go well I feel like there is a ceiling on how much you can enjoy life. I am very lazy and don’t like to have high expectations because they always set you up for disappointment. People say that you’re supposed to work hard in life. I try to but at the end of the day I don’t think there is any career that makes life worth it. I have never really seen any evidence that being alive is a worthwhile venture when you can just be dead. Every single element of human life is just copy and paste. The human life seems so homogenous, there really is no escaping its dread. Everyone more or less does the same thing every day and this is what is supposed to make you happy.

I really don’t think I will kill myself. I love my family more than myself, especially my mom. I think if I killed my self she would kill herself. They are what keep me alive I feel. Almost every friend I’ve ever had did not really see me as a friend, and they all seem to hate me and think I’m a weirdo. I don’t mind this too much. Things get lonely but whatever, loneliness is freedom; I can do what I want when I’m alone. There’s just a limit on what a human can do, I wish I hadn’t been born. I lament my birth so much. I hate the fact that I was brought into this world. There is a ceiling on everything and if you think about it that ceiling is pretty fucking low. We are all just drones building an economy. We function as consumers and nothing more. We pay taxes so that the government can function. We are all pawns, there is no magic to life it’s just a dry shitty existence. Earlier in the semester I planned on going through college and then killing myself after, but this thinking made it impossible to do anything because I thought “my time is short what is the point” but a kid jumped off the roof of my building and that sort of changed my mentality. I thought of thinking more positively believing that “happiness is inside of me” I try very hard to still hold this belief but it’s hard. I look at my future and I feel like life is a prison. I have so many years left. My sentence is way too long. It pains me so much to feel this way because all my mom wants is for me to be happy but I am just unable to. Maybe I’m too lazy, maybe I should try harder. As I said this just doesn’t seem worth it. You can only do so much with this life. 

Every day is agony. I pace and sweat and dread. The only solace I get is from drugs. The friends that I do have I love so dearly, but distance just makes things awkward. I never talk to them and I can feel them drifting further and further away. I wish everyone knew how much I loved them. I try so hard to be a good person, I always think about what I say and I try to be nice to everyone. I must fail at this since I know for a fact many people make an effort to avoid me. 

What hurts me most is how I feel myself drifting away from my family. My mother will always love me. I just have a hard time with my siblings and step siblings and step parent. I love them all so so dearly, I’d give my life for any of them. Yet tomorrow is my birthday and when I heard they were all coming up I had to tell my mom I couldn’t have anyone. I can’t have that pressure. I can’t host my apartment, everyone would be disappointed and it would be a waste of everyone’s time. I love them all so much yet I can’t bring myself to see them. I try so hard to connect with my step dad yet I feel like he’s given up on me. He has tried to talk to me in the past, he knows how depressed I’ve felt I’m the past but I just don’t like talking to people about these things, especially other men. I watch sports with him and try my best to talk with him but I always feel a disconnect and it breaks my heart. I love my step siblings. My older step brother is the older brother I always wanted. I remember when I was 5 just thinking about how badly I wanted an older brother and I got one. We were so close and I love him so much. He is one of the best people I’ve had in my life. Yet now I just feel so awkward and disconnected from him. I hate this so much. In the case of my little brother I love him so much, yet I just can’t say it to him. I’ve been so awful in the past and I’ll never forgive myself. I’ve done so many terrible things and I feel so many terrible ways. None of this really matters, I am just scum. It’s been like this since my freshman year of high school. I could go on and on but I just realized that this post is already way too long.

I am just so worried. I completely hate life I see no positives to it at all and that’s not an exaggeration. I desperately wish I had never been brought into existence. I want this to change so much. I really really desperately do. I need to try harder but I’m the end I think I’ll always feel that it isn’t worth it. Hopefully soon I die in my sleep."
3906,I want to die because my kid ate a chip - I am serious,"Yup. My fiance gave our 5 month old baby a fucking nacho cheese dorito for her first food 2 days ago. I had my back turned, grabbing her an outfit after her bath, and he exclaims how big her eyes were and to look at her... I was confused. He said he gave her a tiny bit of his dorito. I completely fucking lost it, he screamed that he was sorry (out of character for him) and that we can just pretend her first food is something actually appropriate - like mashed sweet potatoes.

This is the smartest guy I have ever known and I cannot believe he has done this... Go ahead and laugh, I deserve it tbh

He just thought it was funny to give a baby a chip I guess, didn't see it as a big deal until I went postal

A background:

I have waited the past two fucking weeks to start trying foods because I wanted us to witness her first time together. He's been working a ton, which is great, so I wanted to be considerate of him and wait as I know they don't *need* to start foods till later

I could not afford her a Halloween outfit so I went to Wal-Mart and bought some the day after Halloween and staged some photos - S/O is calling me a hypocrite due to this

I could not produce enough breastmilk so I gave up and am formula feeding - his family will not shut the fuck up about it even though it's been months now

Her grandma (his mom) is buying her first Christmas outfit/ornaments/whatever because I cannot fucking afford them

I also won't be able to afford her any gifts at all

She also took her first bath photos without me at her house because I was too tired to do it myself while bathing her (she doesn't know, probably)

I lost my job after being hospitalized in pregnancy. They had a lawyer find some loophole to let me go and sent me an official letter to go fuck myself

I have 350k (yes, really) in medical debt and I am declaring bankruptcy on Monday. 
I had insurance. I did everything right. I went to in network hospitals. BUT apparently I had out of network doctors come in while i was under anesthesia to help my doctor during a surgery I had done before I became pregnant. they all bill separately. 

My best friend is suicidal and dealing with her own bullshit, I cannot go to her for fear of triggering her

My brother recently called me a liar for finally coming out about my father sexually abusing me as a child so I don't have him/my family anymore

My fiance is working a lot more since I lost my job so I am alone with a constantly screaming infant 24/7 - we cannot afford childcare

I have had multiple mental breakdowns since her birth and was diagnosed Postpartum Anxiety Disorder

I am already on the maximum amount of medication for depression and anxiety that I can be. Started them while I was in postpartum recovery in the hospital so it's been 5 months of slowly raising the dosage

My psychiatrist has said my recovery is ""in your (my) hands now"" and advises me a daily regimen of exercise to cure me
 
After she was born (within 24 hours) I suddenly realized I will die one day, realized I had no religion, scared of what will happen when we die. This caused me to go to a psych ward in hysterics because I am afraid to die now.

I have a caseworker, a therapist, and a psychiatrist who I see every week.

One is Catholic, one is Buddhist or something, the other is Muslim.

Naturally they all feed me different bullshit about the afterlife, all claim their religion is the right one, etc. Not helping me and causing me more uncertainty and anxiety.

Basically I want to die because I am suffocating daily with death anxiety. The only way to stop it is to just die already.

I feel like I have been trying my absolute fucking hardest to hang on and keep my shit together... I have been trying my hardest for my daughter but somehow I am still fucking up all of her ""firsts"" the way I swore I wouldn't do due to my own childhood traumas

I have endured so much shit in my life and my baby tasting a dorito is somehow the final fucking straw for me

My tombstone: Here lies luna, she died because her kid ate a chip

Seems about right for my fucking joke of a life

I could go on but my mind is a jumbled mess...

TLDR: After years of repeated horrible shit happening to me, I am now unable to handle even the smallest shit not going as planned and I am already on the maximum amount of meds I can be on. I want to die already because I am tired of being ashamed and embarrassed of my failures (particularly as a mother) and to ""get over"" my death anxiety. I truly believe my daughter deserves someone better than me.

Sorry for grammatical errors. I'm crying and can't deal with proofreading atm"
3907,Hopeless,"I just turned 16 a few day’s ago and everything is worse now. I hit my all time low when I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt when I was 14. I felt like it couldn’t get any worse than that, and me feeling terrible again is inexcusable, because I’ve gotten the help I needed. I’ve gotten more than that. But still, I can’t seem to get any better. I’m on such an extreme cocktail of antidepressants that I should be doing just great. I feel so guilty. I feel so stuck. My mind is crowded everyday with these terrifying impulsive thoughts. The only thing that prevented me from going all the way through was thinking about how it would effect my dad. Recently, something has changed. He’s given up. And he expresses that to me everyday. What do you do when you have absolutely nothing- when your quality of life has reached 0. I have nothing to live for. I am completely and utterly alone."
3908,Ever feel like your suicide is inevitable? Like you have no control over it.,"After being kicked out and homeless at 17 my life has been a string of almost making it and then everything being taken away. I'm 20 now and I don't think I'm meant to get out of this hole. I'm going to kill myself one day anyways because I don't want to spend my life like this and noone can help me. The longer I wait, the more people will sacrifice for me, the more I will hurt people, the more I will suffer. I just want to get it over with already. I just wish everyone would understand all the pain I would be saving everyone involved. That it wasn't selfish."
3909,''But you've got so many years ahead of you!'',"I have no reason to live. Last time someone genuinely cared for me was years ago. I came out as MtF transgender and all i got was harrassment. My parents dont support me, my only friends became abusive and I get bullied at my highschool. My brain tells me im worthless. All I do is go to school, go back home and sleep.

But i fell in love. This guy, lets call him James (not his real name) , gave me hope. He was a shining beacon in my life. That is , until he recently changed. He has gotten more aggressive over time, and has started to not care about me. James calls me fat, retarded and other things i cant describe.

I got to an even lower point then i was before. I just wanna end it all. 

Some online friends noticed something was wrong but all they did was tell me ''you've got so many years ahead of you!''. Truth is , I dont see any future for me. I cant do this anymore. Ive just cut contact with everyone this Monday. 

I dont wanna live anymore. Theres no point in life anymore."
3910,Do you ever just do a mundane task or you’re just hanging out with friends/family and you need to excuse yourself because out of nowhere you have an overwhelming urge to cry?,
3911,Suddenly disabled. Husband hates and resents me. I’m alone and scared to death,"A quick explanation of my (37/F) sudden disability: I was a completely healthy, active adult. A few months ago I woke up in the morning, and the muscles all throughout my body had stopped working properly (so weak they shake). I’ve been getting worse by the week and nobody can figure out what’s wrong with me. I’m in constant terrible pain all over and I’ve gotten so frail I’m nearly bed bound. Medication isnt helping the pain or weakness. Can’t care for myself hardly at all now. 

My husband is barely taking care of things that need to be done (laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc). He just sits and games on his computer. If I mention that chores aren’t being done he starts screaming at me until I’m afraid he’s going to hit me.

It happened again today. He didn’t put laundry away, and I can’t dig through the pile to get what I need. He had just been gaming all day instead of doing chores. I’m too weak to tell the whole story but I wound up in a very unsanitary and embarrassing situation because of it. When I brought up the situation with him, he went berserk. I managed to get to my car and leave the house. But I don’t have a coat and it’s 36 degrees out. I have nowhere to go. I’m estranged from my parents due to physical abuse. And my friends have slowly abandoned me over the last few months. I’m completely alone now. I’m in so much pain I want to kill myself. And knowing I’m an unwanted burden who is doomed to a life of neglect and resentment makes me positive I should do it. I have nothing, can’t take care of myself, and I don’t belong anywhere because I’m useless. I don’t know what to do beside figure out a way to end it all. How did this happen to me

EDIT: I managed to drive about 3 miles away and I’m hiding in a parking lot so he can’t find me and hurt me. I’m cold because I have no coat and no idea how to get one since stores are packed due to the holidays and I’m not strong enough to even walk to the door anyway. I’m hungry. Shaking all over from pain and fear. I don’t know what to do. I can’t even think of a way I’d be able to kill myself because I’m too weak. Why is life so cruel"
3912,Is 21 a good age for committing suicide?,"At age 21, I would like to petition for my parents to become permanent residents.

After that, I would consider whether or not to commit suicide at that age."
3913,Am not looking for sympathy,Can’t stop beening useless rubbish at everything no friends r family  for many years I been unhappy and the time as come to leave  the planet tryed jumping last night couldn’t do it can’t get drugs from the shop to young need to find away to end my life painless
3914,That didn’t take long,"I’ve been suicidal since I was a teenager. Always a passive one though. Never would’ve acted on the impulse.

I moved to better area for my daughter. I haven’t needed my medication recently. I met a beautiful girl.

So Thursday, the bottom dropped out. Electronics broke, learned of multiple people true feelings which led to cutting at least 100 people of my Facebook, and my mania switching to depression (diagnosed bipolar years ago)

I’d been looking for a new place to live that’s income based for me and my daughter. Finally found one. Pretty nice, decent area, and if I got approved, based on my income, the rent would be super cheap. 

Even though I hadn’t heard from the complex yet, the woman who was letting me stay with her told me I had till tonight to pack and leave, even though I work today.

Today, I learned I didn’t get the apartment because of my credit score which my ex step mom fucked up years ago, along with my own damage of student loans.

So here I am, homeless, broke, and hours away from family because of where I moved to. If I leave I either leave my daughter or take her with me, which will start a crazy war. My ex (daughters mother) offered to let me crash on her couch. It’s something, but I feel worthless because I can’t not give My daughter any gifts for Christmas because I’ve been desperately trying to save money. And the girl I’m with isn’t ready to move. Understandable, we’ve only been “together” a few months.

I’m at the point where I’ve essentially resolved myself to suicide. My life is so far fucked up that I don’t think I’m ever coming back from it. The only thing I can say I’ve done with my life is create a beautiful daughter, but she doesn’t need a fuck up like me crashing on couches and being broke and unreliable her entire life. The reason I haven’t is i don’t want to make things difficult for people: walking in traffic means someone has to kill me. Gunshots are messy and unreliable. I’m too fat to hang from anywhere I can get to. I don’t have a garage for monoxide. Driving my car into the river or something pollutes the water. Drinking bleach is unreliable. There are no tall places for me to jump off. I don’t have the money to buy drugs to OD on. If you’ve read this far, I’m sorry I’ve burdened you with this. I just had to get this out there somehow and I don’t have anybody to talk about this to."
3915,"Things, used for suicide can prevent suicide","It might sound strange, but it's true -- just having, say a rope, or a gun, or pills next to you gives you a feeling of control. As in, if pain becomes unbearable, I can always end it, once and for all. And it actually makes you feel better, gives you hope. 

And hope is a powerful, uplifting thing."
3916,I'm really gonna do it now.,"The girl I love, I told her goodbye, and she didn't even care.  I can't keep doing this I'm gonna kill myself.  I have a way, and I'm gonna do it, thanks for the help reddit, best website to exist."

3919,I am a failure and shouldn't live.,"As the title says, I'm a failure. I am 18 years old, male, German, and live still with my mother.

I don't know when everything began to go wrong, but I have always been bullied and got abused at home by my father. I was scared shitless to tell anyone but since he disappeared to somewhere everything was kinda ok.

There's just one twist, idk what the fuck I am doing or what I want. I work illegally as a businessman in retail, part time, get 9€ per hour but my mother said that it can't keep going like this. I know that it can't but I don't want to seriously work or do anything else other than playing games, sleeping and reading manga.

I only keep working because I can't just get myself to say that I want to quit. I can't say anything tbh. If I get asked by someone to help with something I can't get myself to say no. I can't quit jobs because I can't get myself to talk to the boss.

I'm just a bother to my mother since she has to pay for bills and all that shit. I pay her 400€ monthly because that's what she demands to let me stay at home.

It's been about a day that i started to think about suicide again. I tried to kms in the past 2 times. But I didn't know how back then and failed. 

I don't want to continue living. I hate work, I hate people, I hate how this world works. I am not fit to live in this society. I just want to die in a car crash or something.

 I've stopped looking when crossing roads. I've stopped working out. I've stopped cooking for myself and only eat microwave food. I've stopped fighting against my alcohol addiction. I just want to end it.

Sry for the long post. I just wanted to vent ig."
3920,I've fucked up every relationship I have.,"All of my friends have left from me distancing myself or they just don't respond because they got tired of me. My family is consumed with eachother or friends/spouses so they wouldn't give a fuck if i was gone. What's the point anymore? Everything feels empty and no one cares, money doesn't make me happy. Even when I get support nothing feels okay. I don't care about my future anymore, I'm just waiting for it to get cold enough to go freeze in the woods after overdosing just in case it doesn't work, there's no point if no one is gonna get hurt and everyone will win anyway."
3921,Sick of my life,"I feel alone. I push people away because I'm not worthy to have people loving me.
I love my family, my girlfriend, best friend and friends but they are better without me. I'm just a fuck-ng weight.
I have nothing to live for and I have sever OCD, my life doesn't have a meaning anymore because I no longer like the things I used to love due to my illness and panic.

I'm just gaining courage to do it. I still haven't figured it out the best way to do it. But I want to.
The only thing that holds me is my loved one's pain... But I really have nothing that keeps me sane enough to move on. I just want to die.

It's relaxing to write suicidal letters... So much to say."
3922,I feel responsible and heartbroken and I just want to go away,"My adult son is a diagnosed sociopath. He has Antisocial Personality Disorder. He’s dangerous. My husband and I spent his life hiding the truth from family and friends. It got worse. He lies constantly. He’s convinced people that we are abusive and neglectful. I get screaming voicemails and nasty text messages from every girl he dates/uses. 

Today was the last straw. I got the last nasty voicemail from an unknown number. The last  time a girl who didn’t even know me tells me I’m a bitch and failure of a mother at my own house. The last time my younger kids beg me to ask their brother to never come around again. The last time I watch my husband’s heart break. 

Yet. I can’t shake the terror at knowing who he is, what he is, and the hurts he will keep causing. The stupid little girl he’s with now has no idea. Her family doesn’t. There’s nothing I can do. He’ll move on to do more reckless and more dangerous things. He shouldn’t have access to a gun but he does. He should be taking his medications but he won’t. He’s going to hurt someone. He’s spiraling out of control and that’s when he’s most dangerous. 

I feel like this is all my fault. I can’t save whoever it is he’s going to hurt. I am terrified that he’ll end up on the news one day and I’ll be blamed. My family will be painted as monsters who raised a monster. I just don’t want to be around for it. 

I can’t do this life."
3923,Had a rough night,"Last night I tried calling someone who I thought was a friend, someone she was with answered. Whatever it's no big deal, about half a hour later she texts me saying she's worried is asking for my last name. I give it to her for her to call the veterans crisis line, I'm an army veteran btw. Anyways the police show up to check up on me, I'd rather the hotline call me first but whatever. After that I text her thanking her and explain what happene., and I dont know what she was expecting but she was definitely upset saying things like don't waste the polices time, and some other things including how she doesn't want to be friends anymore. I don't remember everything she said, I deleted the text and told her today that I will be respectful but I'm blocking her. Oh and I forgot to mention, sometimes I will reach out to my friends when I'm having the the thoughts or when I have a feeling of writing a suicide note because sometimes I get pretty convinced that one day I will kill myself. Don't get me wrong I would never message someone like that for attention and would never get mad at someone trying to help. I just can't help but notice that this is the second time where a friendship ended because I'm assuming mental health issues can be too much for certain people. I'm also in group and one on one therapy as well as on anti depressants. I don't know maybe she wanted me to go to the hospital, as did someone else that I still talk to. The thing is, I've been to the psych ward before and know when I need it, anyone else here going through depression sometimes feel like others think they know what's best? It makes me just not want to tell anyone at all anymore."
3924,Signing Off,"I've attempted suicide so many times and have failed. Nobody in my life knew I attempted even once because nobody ever cares if I disappear for hours. I have tried to od on pills several times, but I wake up the next morning and go to school, feeling sick and unhappy, but I push through. Life seems unbearable now, just a speck of something that seems so bright and brilliant for those around me, but so bleak and soundless for me. I have amazing friends and a significant other who is one of the few people who makes me happy no matter what, but they can't keep protecting me forever. My home life is terrible, but I'm the only person who sees the monsters I live with. My parents are nice to outsiders and my sisters, but I'm the exception. I destroyed everything in their perfect lives. I enjoy school, I love to learn, but since my sister got into college early and is graduating again by the time I graduate high school, she is looked at as the golden child in our family. My sisters are both beautiful and thin, but only one person has ever told me I was beautiful, not just my eyes. This person, my SO, had made a huge impact in my life, and I could never forget that. 

My mom wad never a mother to me, even when I was a kid and needed her. She was there for both my sisters, but me, I never had a mother. Never really had a father either. He's nicer than my mother, but he's never really around. My mother will yell at me for nothing, it could be about my grades to the look on my face. She yelled at me for 2 hours about my rbf, then slapped me and took my phone. I don't hate my mother, I just wish I had another mother.

I'm being selfish, wishing I had someone else as a mother when some people don't even have a mother. I'm always selfish though, never can get that one quite right. I always get told from my family that I should think about others more than myself. I should really take that advice, but I can't change so easily. 

I cook dinner, I clean the house, I take my mom's dog on runs and walks, I make food for my mom, I take care of our pets. But it's never enough, I'm still selfish for wanting a few things every now and then.

My sisters had the perfect all honors with straight A's in high school. I only have 2 honors classes with a few B's and the rest are A's. I guess I can never live up to my sisters, they were perfect and I'm just a mess.

I don't have control in my life, so I started controlling my food after my family continued to call me fat. I developed anorexia, bulimia, and b.e.d after awhile. I keep losing weight and I hope that I drop from not weighing enough. But I wake up, go to school, go home, opening the door to a disappointed look on my mothers face as she hands me the leash to her dog and I go for a run. 

Every time I go to sleep, I hope to not wake up the next day, but I always do. I'm stuck in a hell where it's always in the same loop. Wake up, hate myself, go to school, feel pathetic and alone, go home, get screamed at for hours, stay up late doing homework, feel bad about my horrible grades, get an hour of sleep while wishing to never wake up again. Same loop every day. Nothing changes.

My best friend, he always jokes about killing himself, but I would cry and mourn his death if he ever truly did. I love him, he's a brother to me. I don't think he'd miss me though, he doesn't ever hang out with me outside of school or talk to me much anymore. That's okay, I wouldn't want any of my friends to mourn my death, I'm not worth it.

If you read all of this, thanks, most people in my life don't even listen to me for a second."
3925,Always comes back to this,"Have you ever lost something or someone so critical to you that life felt empty and meaningless without it? I've done all the right things man. I called the hotlines, went to therapy, took meds, went to the hospital 2x, did as friends suggested and all I got was lost and drowning in my anxiety and ptsd. When I had this thing my life was happy now all I know is pain and fear. Fml and fuck 2019 for ruining it."
3926,I almost did it,"I almost did it last month. I was really close. But I didn’t. I regret not doing it. I just feel like it could’ve been over and I missed my chance to end this pain. 

I’m really trying to stay alive. It just feels like I have no one. Everyone in my life is either cruel or abusive or flat out uncaring. I try and reach out to people who “love” me and they just talk about themselves or say some shit like “I’m sorry.” “it could be worse.”

I’m trying so hard to find where I fit in and I can just LIVE. Just go to work, come home, cook, take care of myself, pay my bills. sleep... without wishing I were dead and crying most of the day. That’s all I want. 

I don’t even want to be rich or successful. I don’t even want love. I don’t need some “amazing career.” I don’t need excitement or popularity or admiration. I just want peace. Maybe a tiny bit of understanding. I just want to love myself. I don’t feel like I ask for much and I’m so tired of living."
3927,I'm scared to talk about it with my friends,"I feel I will give them troubles they don't deserve, I want to go to my college's therapists but I have to wait till January. Should I keep my thoughts till then? I don't want my family to know about this, and I feel that if I tell what I feel to some of my friends, they will tell my family"
3928,I don’t wanna live anymore,"I’m lonely.. I have no one to talk to.. I’m just all alone in this world. I have been made fun off, humiliated and betrayed. I just don’t wanna be alive. I just wanna go into eternal slumber"
3929,My Ending,"I've attempted suicide so many times and have failed. Nobody in my life knew I attempted even once because nobody ever cares if I disappear for hours.

3930,Dead on the inside,"I feel like shit all the time, my wife no longer loves me, I've been cutting up and down my legs so nobody will notice for weeks now, I can't find any patch of unscathed skin to cut anymore... I just want to end it... I can't even bring myself to get out of bed today... I've been blowing off my friends and family for a while now too... It just feels like everything is crumbling... How can I get out of this slump?"
3931,Do not care about anything anymore.,"I'm so fucking tired of everything. Health problems, no friends, inability to get any dates. I'm just done. I don't want to deal with any of this bullshit anymore. All I do is sit at home and dwell on things. I have no friends to do anything with, have no dates to ever go on. All I do is get ghosted. 

I don't want to be alive, there is nothing I enjoy in my life."
3932,"I have some razor blades,and actively cut myself. I keep thinking about how easy it would be to end it.","Firstly, this is a throwaway account so my friend doesn't find out about this.

I keep thinking about how easy it would be to slit my wrists, and anywhere else I can, take some sleeping pills and end it. I understand I'm young and have so much to do and see, but I don't want to be around to do it."
3933,i’ve been doing pretty bad,"recently got officially diagnosed with BPD, i might lose my apartment soon, my dad was physically violent towards me when i moved back in with him, now i have no one and i’m scared i’m going to die soon. just from homelessness or from suicide, even though that’s the last thing i want to do i feel like i have no other option"
3934,who gives a crap about it anyway,"no one would give a crap if i die anyway like right now or they would only care like liars telling OH GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DID THIS
WELL NO SHIT SHERLOCK TRY TO THINK WHY
i'm tired of all this shit i even have a realy good choice of ways to kill myself (almost everything i'd say) well then i just need to complete my suicide note do some stuff this new year then i'm gonna end this i don't care anymore"
3935,"Tonight, just before dawn. 22m","I feel bad for my roommate. Hell come in the evening. Ill let the warm water on just enough to wash the blood off but not that much so I waste it. I might think of better method, still got some time.

I cleared browser history and all my legal arangements will be dealt with after i Am officially diseased.

No goodbye letters, it’s better to let others think I was mentally unstable, the truth is that i am just tired. It isnt fun.

As for my familly, they are not that bad people and they really think they tried, but the fact is that the guiltshaming and them trying to be good parents caused this.

As for what is after, i dont know. I have ideas, but thats gonna be a surprise.

Ask if there is something you wanna know, still got few hours."
3936,I can't find a reason.,"I can't find a reason not to. The woman of my dreams left 5 months ago, my cat is dying, I've got almost no friends, no interest in working and no job, I just got used as a side piece and feel like a piece of shit for sleeping with a woman in a committed relationship without even knowing, and after a year of medications it still feels like nothing works.

Fuck, I couldn't even finish my 4 years as a Marine. I can't find a reason not to be one of those 22 for the day."
3937,Unite,"Ever wonder if the lot of us combined, that all our needs could actually be met?

So many of us lack family, friendship, love. So many of us need someone to understand them. What if we actually *did* something to get our needs met amongst ourselves? We all offer something, even though we all lack many things.

Or maybe I’m drunk."
3938,No one gives a damn,"I’m going to do it tonight, the person I cared about pushed me away, my family isn’t there for me. I just want to be done and cremated spread somewhere"
3939,whatever,"the state of my mental health has been degrading at a rate that i never imagined it would. the only emotions i've felt in the last three months have been anxiety, shame, and boredom. every time i've gone out of my way to find some human interaction it makes me feel paranoid for some reason. even when i'm alone in my room i feel like i'm being judged.

honestly i have so little motivation to do anything at all that i can barely find the energy to type out a few sentences for this post. i'm just so desperate for someone to present a solution that i'm putting everything i can into this. i know objectively that nobody can solve this but me, that i have to make the effort to not be depressed and to better myself, but i don't want to. i don't WANT anything. why should i better myself if there's no outcome that i want from it?

this is all so random. my thoughts are so scattered all the time. i didn't realize that i wanted to kill myself until just recently, and i feel like i'm drowning in all these negative emotions about myself. i don't have anyone to discuss this with, so i'm just throwing this post out into the void. writing this has made me feel worse. i can't believe i'm suicidal."
3940,"""Love yourself""","Sometimes they say we should love ourselves, and that if we love ourselves, then we won't commit suicide. While that is a nice thing to say, I don't think they quite get it. It's been more than 4 years of having these daily pervasive suicidal thoughts. It's been very painful. There were many days I stayed on the bed from morning to night, only leaving to use the bathroom. Other days, I would go through my day feeling completely awful and then cry myself to sleep. It seems as if this is never going to end. I've already abandoned the notion of ""it gets better,"" because as of now, it has only gotten worse. If I truly loved myself, then I would've ended it 4 years ago."
3941,[18F] i started to write a suicide note last night.,"(this is a throwaway account btw, i don't need anyone i know seeing this and finding out who i am)

last night was one of the worst in a long time and i no longer feel loved or wanted by anybody or anything...i have been struggling with suicidal ideology since the 6th grade (at least, maybe a little longer than that) and have come close quite a few times to going through with it, although winter 2017 and spring 2019 were the worst of all. in winter of 2017 i planned on committing suicide on my 16th birthday, which was in august, but never went through with it of course. this spring my grandmother passed away suddenly from a stroke, my parents and i were living with her at the time. that really triggered something in me and i considered going through with it on an almost daily basis, i became preoccupied with it. i graduated high school in june and i am genuinely shocked i made it that far

well anyways, i am at that point again. i would prefer not to get into detail about it but yesterday was truly horrible and i was home alone, i had to come have my aunt pick me up because i didn't trust myself to be home alone and not attempt to hurt myself. last night i also began to write a suicide note, i'm not really sure why, but i did. and this isn't the first time i've done something like this either

the thing is that i am too cowardly to go through with it because i don't want to make my friends and my mom sad but i hate being alive. i hate existing. everything is so painful. i don't believe i am truly capable of going through with it currently but i wouldn't be surprised if i die by my own hands someday. my father has never allowed me to get therapy and every time my mom tries to he gets mad because ""i'm fine""

i am tired of feeling afraid and unwanted and disposable and i just want to be at peace someday"
3942,17F. Can't stop thinking about suicide.,"Hello. I'm not sure where I could share my pain, but I guess this is the subreddit. 

To start, I've been very suicidal, depressed and anxious for the past few years of my life. I am currently on Fluoxetine, prescribed by my doctor. I've reached out to get help and saw a therapist regularly for a while and stopped about 8 months ago. As far as therapy, I feel like it just didn't work for me and I could pretend like I was doing better but it wasn't helping me. I know some of my problems could be seen as temporary, however the problem is new problems arise all the fucking time and I can't deal with any of it anymore. I'm just not strong enough.

I have an extremely supportive family who I cherish, and about one extremely close friend. As far as my family, they know I struggle with my mental health but I haven't been able to tell them how bad it's gotten. I am terrified of disappointing them, and I don't want them to view me as a failure. As far as my friends, I have had a falling out with most of my other friends in my life, and honestly, it's what I deserve. And even for the one close friend who I still have, I've unintentionally hurt him in the past and I haven't been able to forgive myself. The one thing I have accomplished in my life has been school, but quite frankly, it's all getting more and more meaningless. I should be grateful as I received great scholarships for colleges but it doesn't even seem to matter to me as I know I'll be dead before I get to college. 

I had someone who I had a close relationship with at a point kill herself. I was at her funeral, and couldn't help feeling like I was next. Everyone was really sad but they also said that she was in a better place and I truly believe that. It was comforting, in a way.

I don't know how to keep living and each day gets more and more miserable. I'm so tired of this exhausting existence and I've been told over and over that it is going to get better, but nothing has improved since my suicide idealizations started a few years ago. I am so terrified to die. There are very few foolproof methods of suicide that wouldn't be extremely painful, and I don't want to bring any shame and guilt to my family and the few friends I have left. And it might just be my survival instinct, but I find it hard to actually go through with any method thus far. I think pills would be ideal, but I know they have low success rates and if I attempt, I want to make sure I stay dead.

And maybe this is just another excuse but I refuse to kill myself over the holidays because of the pain it would bring my family ever year to associate Christmas with my suicide. That wouldn't be fair to them.

I don't know what I am looking for by posting this but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for listening."
3943,"Sort of want to die, but don't want to kill myself",Does anyone else feel like this? I feel like I need a way out but I don't want to kill myself. I wouldn't be averse to my own death though. I want to talk to my therapists about it but I'm worried they'll have me committed to a hospital. I can't talk to my parents about it. How do you guys feel?
3944,"Life is a big fat joke, im not even suicidal enough for this sub...",
3945,the only escape from feeling like shit (Gaming) isn’t fun anymore and just makes me want to die even more,"I could always count on playing league of legends with friends would make me feel better but the game isn’t fun anymore for me and most of my friends don’t play anymore. If I play solo I always end up feeling worse and I am playing really badly as well nowadays. I don’t like any other games and nothing else seems appealing to me I don’t have any hobbies left that are fun to me and I’m failing at university as well.    
I don’t have any reason to keep living and nothing I’m looking forward to I wish I could kill myself but hurting my family sucks. The only thing I have left to do is cutting my arms from time to time and letting day by day pass by without doing anything worthwhile.    
I’m isolating myself really hard and barely talk to friends or other people anymore but no one cares about that which tells me it wouldn’t be bad if I died.     
The only thing keeping me alive is not wanting to hurt my family and not having a clue how I should kill myself i don’t have access to guns or drugs so I guess traintracks would be the only way but if I did that I would definitely write an apology letter to the people who would be effected by that like the ones who clean it up and the people whose trains will be late because of it."
3946,Pros and cons,"Pros: I don’t have to feel anymore 
No more pain
No more pressure from life school etc

Cons:
People would miss me maybe but they’d get over it"
3947,The only person who cares about me wants to move away.,"For nearly ten years of my life I have been friends with this girl and I have been able to go to her with anything. She has been my only source of comfort because she is the only person in the world who would chose me over someone else. But recently she opened up to me about being depressed due to her family situation and how she wants to move away to her other dad’s house half way across the globe. I want her to be happy but I’m scared to lose her, because I think that might be my final straw. This past year I have been more suicidal than ever and everyday is a struggle to stay alive. I’m scared that if she decides to leave I’ll be left alone, and then I’ll just off myself. I’ve been thinking about telling her but I don’t want to burden her with any of my problems. What should I do?"
3948,I am nothing.,"I’ve tried therapy and medications. They’ve done nothing. I’ve tried socializing. I’ve tried not socializing and just letting things come. I am alone.

I have no friends, family, acquaintances, no ex’s, no dating history. I’ve never been liked by anyone. From childhood to high school I was bullied severely. I am too damaged. My social skills are gone and I’m an outcast.

It doesn’t help that I’m a tranny freak. I have no connection to anyone or any group. I failed at connecting with a lgbt group. I’ve failed at work and college.

I’m not respected and the authentic me is ignored. I have loved others but no one is capable of loving me and I understand why. I’m ugly, anxious, weird and can’t communicate well.

I’m trash and a failure of a human being. I will never be loved or wanted. I just get sympathy messages online. People lie and say they care about me, send me a message and then stop responding.

I was a waste of a human being and it’s time to go. I have been rejected by society and can no longer be so isolated. If this were 2000 years ago I’d be dead. Humans didn’t survive for long being alone and rejected by their tribe. Now that bear that used to kill us is a gun or a bridge."
3950,Ugly Duckling of the Family,"My entire family is hot in some way. I'm not. I can't dress myself to save my life. No sense of fashion or taste. What I like people think doesn't match and doesn't go. Not only that but I'm attracted to these family members that make me feel guilt ridden and if only I could turn what I love into something wonderful and profitable; instead it's just the fantasy of a dirty and sex famished mind. I can't afford my own place yet but I wish I could so I could get away from the temptations that surround me; so the cycle of these cravings and endless, fruitless fantasies continue and therapy can't help because I need to physically remove myself from a home that I can't afford to leave and no coping mechanism will help how badly I want certain taboos. Which ultimately I keep hidden and locked away because I'll be scorned and admonished if I am so I'm just stuck. I can't get what I can't have and with no strong desires or wants suicide seems to really be the answer"
3951,17F losing the will,"I'm just so done. I'm so replaceable. I'm sitting in front of a maths paper right now, thinking about how shit I am at maths. I have no friends, they're all backstabbers and people who only pretend to give a fuck. What's the point in life when all I do is study, and still get everything wrong. I want to overdose on something. I want to feel sick and go to hospital where people actually want you there. I want to feel alive again, not some brain dead zombie student who desperately wants to escape because she's cracking under the pressure. Fuck everything. I'm so sad all the time. Ive already cried twice today because I can't do maths. I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow, and I can't bare the thought of it. Why does anything matter"
3952,Wish it wasn't the holidays,If it wasnt the holidays I'd actually maybe allow myself to die. But I dont wanna ruin the holidays for my parents forever. Yet idk how I can deal with being so suicidal.
3953,Hey All,"New to This

I’m new to this subreddit. As for depression though, I’ve had phases of it I believe. I feel like I’ve always handled any depression well in the past. Although I don’t think I’m depressed now, I am undoubtedly lonely and have been for too long, which I feel is the reason for any onset of depression or feelings of misery for me. For those with the same feelings, my question is how? Honestly, why go on living when you know nothing will ever get better? The answer to this question, if there is any, certainly varies from person to person and I guess some personal context would be appropriate. I’ll try to keep it brief. 

For the past several years, I’ve been in this limbo of trying to understand where I fit in society and through the years of mu own personal experience for factors they’re have been consistent, I’ve concluded I simply don’t. I do my best to improve my situation but no matter the environment and how different it may have been than the last, I find myself dealing with the same issues, the only difference being is that I’m surrounded by new faces. I think I know my worth as a human but for others I’m not worth getting to know in any meaningful capacity. Most of my life the past several years seemed to be me contemplating what it is I lack compared to everyone around me who were much better than myself in what could be considered normal human things (simply being socially engaged for introverts and extroverts alike) and for me I have failed, at least to the extent where I find my own life pointless. I don’t have much else going for me in terms of, intelligence or athletic ability, (although there is more to life than those two things), and I feel myself wanting to be wanted by somebody because I offer something they value, regardless of what that may be, either for a trait as superficial as looks or for my odd personality. I have caring parents/relatives, and to briefly sum up how I feel about those rltsps is that those are nothing more than obligations. I mean, what type of parent would you be if you didn’t care for your children? Point is, I’ll only ever find purpose in being able to organically create bonds myself with strangers, and as long as I’ve lived, I haven’t been able to successfully do so, particularly with women. Im fairly young, at 20, (birthday recently passed and spent my day inside my dorm and a childhood friend, whom I haven’t seem in years, was the only one who wished my a happy b-day) and there are people much older than myself struggling with the same issues to which I ask, again, why continue? 
Even as negative as these thoughts might be, I feel I am an optimistic individual but at the same time rational. Despite efforts I’ve made to help, primarily therapy, I can’t come to think that anything will ever change or at the very least, there’s slim chance, which then again may be my overly optimistic and naive thoughts that lead me to aimlessly live until I happen stumble upon that day. It’s ironic how I’ve never once, up until a couple years ago, really cared for relationships as I do now until it hit me just how lonely I was. 
Relatively speaking, I would be content with far less in regards to social involvement then what I see from others but even this minimal social desire of mine escapes me. I know this may be lengthy and may have not been as detailed as it could have been, but if you have any thoughts or questions at all, please feel free to share them.

TL;DR; Why continue living when there is no guarantee of it improving. Better yet, how? Is suicide really not an option if you were told nothing would ever change, nothing would ever get better?"
3954,Toxic person is going to push me over the edge and I can’t control it or cut them out,"I am really sorry to be alive. I’ll set the scene here a bit. I own a community online. It’s big, around 1,300 people, and I’ve been building it since about a year and a half now. There was the person who was a moderator and he would always be secretly toxic towards me, making fun of my interests and who my friends are etc. He knows that I’m mentally unstable and said that I’m using it to manipulate people into getting what I want, but I actually want to die. I’m not sure if I’ll even make it to the new year. Anyways a while ago, bout 2 months ago, I demoted this him because of tired of his abuse towards me and some of my friends. But now a mod who’s been there since before that is campaigning for him to be let back again and some of his other mod buddies are agreeing. I am the owner of the community and can physically remove any of them but I don’t think it’s fair nor do I want to seem like a fascist and be bombarded with questions as to why they’d be potentially gone. It’s quite active and I’ve met some of the members abroad (a good 30 of them ish?) and I’m just not ready for that kind of pressure. I’ve expressed my concerns to the other mods but they don’t seem to care how he effects my mental state. Maybe none of them would care if I were gone, maybe that’s what they want. I should die and make them happy."
3955,Can anyone kill me ?,"Please do it , I can't take this anymore"
3956,Please Help,"Long Post Ahead,also pardon my english I am not a native speaker.Please do give a reply I am in a state of shock of the events that just happened and really need some advice.Please don't ignore,please help me.

Today I had to go to the bank to get the receipt for my form which will make me eligible to give my senior secondary exams.Since,I study in a very well known(I am not exaggerating or anything) university in India which manages almost every course you can find.So,I am in the final year of my schooling and had to get a receipt to fill my form for the admit card.The thing is that we have to get that receipt from the bank specifically for university and that is quite far from my home(almost 15kms one  way) and I was very sick yesterday and I still am.I usually am made to commute that distance with bicycle and it exhausts me a lot even when I am in normal state much less being able to  commute while I am sick.On the other hand,my brother has a bike and wasn't going anywhere when I asked him yesterday,but to piss me off he took away the bike with him when I was about to go saying that I need to exercise(yes I am obese) and he went to play some  games on arcade with his friends and my parents are heavily biased when the stuff involves me and my brother.My mother was always heavily biased and says that my brother is always right and I am always wrong and my father used to be neutral until I told my mom that he sexts girls on facebook only god knows how he befriend.So,he saw me burning up with fever and still went away to piss me off(happens always he never lets me touch his stufd while he can take any of my stuff without even asking and yes he is always correct).Then come my parent,as usual started their usual body shaming(I was struck with a disease for two years which made me obese,I didn't become fat by being a sloth and a lazy ass) and even threatened to burn my books if I don't adhere and cursing me.I was yes in fever but since today I really needed to get the thing done so I somehow left on my bicycle,It took me 1 hour to reach the bank,another 10 minutes to fill out the receipt,and another hour for standing in a queue and all that while buring up with fever.So,I got a receipt and had to submit the form too(it wasn't the last date) so I took out the form and then I realised that I had left my documents at home,So I called my brother if he can bring them but he was very busy playing games with his friends and yes he never hangs up without body shaming me.I wasn't really in the state to commute 50+ kms a day so I went home.I wasn't able and I still am not able to think straight with fever burning up my body.But had to go through another session of my parents telling me how irresponsible I am and how much I piss of everybody and how better the world would have been if I was never born and yes another body shaming.I just went on my bed and slept for almost 3 hours after taking medicines.When I woke up my dad was busy sexting again but hiding his phone as if I don't know,my mother was watching television and my brother was in his room(maybe studying I am not sure,he keeps his door always).Then my mom ordered me to bring clothes which were drying upstairs and I refused and said I am sick from fever and from them and their behaviour towards me,same instant my brother opened and told me to shut the fuck up because his friends can hear me shouting(he was playing PUBG,I thought he was studying).She told me to go because she can't miss what's being telecasted on T.V and as of now and my dad and brother were too busy to even move.I was already pissed by their behaviour towards me and I shouted on the top of my lungs and told her to go to hell.That was the catalyst which made my dad to come running towards and punched me on my nose and hit his knee while punching me for the second time.I was on bed at that time and he has been an instructor at hand to hand combat back in his army days.So,that did hurt him and made him more angry that he brought a bat and was trying to hit it on my head in turn I grabbed the bat so he couldn't hit me(I am taller than him) so he tried hitting me with his other hand and called my mom to help him.So my mom started hitting me with a shoe but for the cause of my ego I didn' t let go of the bat and they kept hitting me for a long time(I am  ot making this up,seriously not).Then came my brother and he started hitting me too,all three of them were hitting me as hard as they can but with hands as of now so that I would let go of the bat,but I didn't not at all.I was burning up with fever but the adrenaline kept me going.Then my brother hit as hard as he could around my knee,that really hurt me and made it hard for me to stand all while shouting and saying how much he hates and how much he wants to kill me and what a waste of sperm I am.My dad lost all his cool and I don't why but he left for uptairs cursing my existence and sayi g how much I disrespected him by grabbing that bat while they were trying to hit me.Then,my mother and brother started saying how much they did for me and this is what I give them i  return,then my dad came back with clothes and told me to get out of the house and didn't budge by single inch and said to try whatever they can.That really hurt his ego and he and my brother held me while my mom brought a machete and told me that she doesn't care if the police arrests them,they won't go until that machete takes my neck off.My brother had the bat and he put it aside as of then.I somehow got out of their hold and grabbed that machete and threw it away.Then my dad again cursed me and told my mom and brother to murder me and dispose me off while he got himself his phone and the cigarette.Now,my mom started talking as to why I am so disrespectful to them and my brother and the  I screamed as to what I was going through this noon when I had to go to the bank and even spat on her face(I regret doing that as a human).My brother lost his cool and grabbed the bat and tried to hit me on my neck aggressively I stopped it but it hurt my hand quite much.Until then I didn't hit back because I respected them but I lost it all and said I will kill you and grabbed his neck and floored him while aggressively holding his neck and choking him.My mom and seeing that started kicking me to somehow let him go and my dad came back and started kicking me too.I was too weak and was already down with fever I couldn't keep it any longer.He gasped for breath and punched on my face and I landed on my back and then all three of them started kicking me.They kicked me for almost a minute or two,my whole body was aching as of then.I don't why they stopped but maybe I was inches aways from dying.Then my mom started crying because I tried to kill my brother and how I didnt let of that bat when they wanted to hit that on my head.I was in a quite vegetative state as of then so I dont remember much of it.I do remember my brother was crying because I tried choking him.My mother went on saying that how can they trust me,I would kill them when I had the chance while I was there lying almost dead.I was then made to apologize to everyone.My mom and dad were consoli g my brother and I was lying there in front of them.

So,Now I have taken some painkillers.I cannot  bear that pain anymore,my right leg is heavily hurt and I bow have trouble walking.My body is mostly swollen by taking this all beating and I am not in any hospital as of now.No one cares.NO ONE CARES.

They gave me some stale food they made in the noon and forgot to take my phone.They went out to eat.

I am hurt very much hurt as of now,I don't know what to do.I can't even move out as of now,I have no way of earning.I dont want to commit suicide,I want to live.I am in tears as of now.Please give me some advice please."
3957,"27M, half hour west of Universal Studios, no direction, goals, or wants in life other than to just exist.","I've tried college twice. Volunteering. A few relationships and hookups. Terrible alcohol experiences and don't want to ever drink again. I smoke weed multiple times a day. I see a therapist and I'm on drugs that I keep switching out because every time we change what it is and/or the dosage I feel like a robot that's numb and can't feel want sense of happy or sad just Adam Sandler at the end of ""Click"" on autopilot mode. A dozen jobs that I couldn't keep because a failed scoliosis surgery that made my right leg longer than my left and it hurts sitting or standing in one position for a prolonged time. I can't stand at a retail bay, stand as a security guard, work as an assistant teacher, a restaurant host, dog walker, etc because of this horrible disability. SSI and benefits I can't activate until the end of NEXT month because they're so booked up and who knows how many more hoops to jump through just to get a few hundred dollars that will just get swallowed by apartment rent, transportation (my electric scooter rentals/bus/trains/subways) and food. With no money coming in and a back disability there's no one on Bumble or Tinder or Plenty of Fish or DateMySchool that wants to strike up a conversation with me at all. My only coping mechanisms are scooter rides through the mountains (relaxing but gets dull), video games (relaxing but also gets pretty dull), sports (relaxing but also gets dull) weed (expensive/costly hobby) Disney+/Netflix/Pirate Bay acquisitions (can get very dull) volunteering at my local hospital and homeless shelters (hasn't given me a change of perspective) photography (I feel guilty with the amount of hours I lust over a wide variety of different cultures and backgrounds and all for a ten second euphoric high with nothing more?) Petting my cat, rabbit, and dog (haha of course that gets dull eventually) I'm just saying I feel like a very well rounded person who has tried to build a life, tried different ways of staying afloat with therapy and prescriptions, tried to work different occupations and gave it a good effort. But I'm still seven years and 3 suicide attempts into still desiring to still no longer be here. There's no desire to wake up. At all. I live a cycle of these coping mechanism and fantastical worlds on screens and in my head and work jobs where my back is literally KILLING me by hour two and I barely make enough to just exist... What's the point? Suicide prevention and warm line? By the end of an hour it's summed up to ""you'll eventually have to find it within you"". It's just not coming. It's not. If we all were of the same mind and had the same bodies then the world would work for everyone. But it doesn't. I don't condone anyone to act out on his/her suicidal notions because as an empath with hope for others, I believe you really can find that formula. I just have another day to live for where I live on government assistance and must feel grateful that I'm not on skid row or in jail or in danger of any kind right? Nah. It's all empty. Everyone around me even those I only sort of know have a direction even if not their calling they can figure out how to exist... At least pleasantly.
I just can't. I can't figure this out. another decade of this goes by and I'm still living in my mom's home... For sure attempt#4...."
3958,I've hurt too much people. Now I need to be hurt myself,"I have hurt many people emotionally by just existing. I'm a failure. I'm a dick. I'm so fucking mean to people. I deserve death. I don't need help. I'll die anyways.

I'll make a plan and I probably will make a new post.
Cya"
3959,I'm doomed,"It's almost happening everyday. The numbness. The empty void I feel especially in my chest. My heart's broken and heavy and I don't like it. Everytime. Starting from waking up to going back to bed. 

It's kinda ironic though from the numbness you can still feel that it's painful, and to end that pain you must hurt yourself even more to feel something. It's confusing, I fucking know. You're basically fighting pain with more pain. 

To end this situation, I want to cheat my way out of this life. If I do, It'll be peaceful for me. I'd stop feeling. I'll just be a wandering ghost. I'll stay out of everyone's bullshit and just standby, watch. I had enough with people hurting me.

I'm not really looking forward to anything good next year. If there is, fine. That's great  But I'll never expect anymore  When you don't, you won't be disappointed.

 If fate wants to destroy my life and my whole being, it may do so. There's nothing left for me to lose anyways."
3960,Struggling,"Thanks in advance for reading.  This is kinda long.

I've been dealing with ideation for over 20 years, since I was a teenager.  It just crept in and has stuck with me through everything.  Oddly, the only time I was ever free from it was in my 20s when I was stricken with a very deadly and fast-moving blood cancer, truly on the brink of death, and in intense treatment for about a year.  When I was back to ""normal,"" everything came back tenfold.

I tell myself, my doctors, and the few people I'm close to that I would \*never\* do it.  I truly feel that way.  But the constant cycle, the constant thoughts, and the constant self-talk is so exhausting.  And I am worried that I have suicides and hospitalizations for depression/anxiety in my family.  In my close, direct family.

People who know me would describe me as kind, confident, funny, compassionate, handsome, strong, interesting.  I have an important career (that \*doesn't\* mean I have a lot of money; I don't) where people depend on me.  I have beautiful children and a beautiful (in all ways) girlfriend.  But I feel constantly on edge, desperate, scraped out from the inside.  Most of the time I just hear a constant drone of ""kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself...""  For two decades.  First thought in the morning, last thought before I fall asleep.  Even at the most beautiful and important moments in my life, this pulsing thought is there.  I can be smiling, sitting across from someone I love, chatting and drinking coffee, and the voice is there. 

My relationship does have problems that we've struggled with for a while with how we attach to each other.  She has her own issues and, if you know anything about attachment theory, she's avoidant and I'm not.  It's tough.  I'm depressed and ideating when I'm with her, talking to her, whatever, and I'm also depressed and ideating when I'm considering life without her.  Sex provides relief, but that's fleeting.  We can't just have sex all the time.

I work closely with my docs and am seeing a psychiatrist soon, which I've done in the past as well.  I do have an anxiety disorder and depression that my docs are aware of.  And a history of trauma I won't go into here.  I do expect that the psychiatrist is going to tell me I have ptsd; it's just what all the professionals leading up to this meeting have been saying.  I used to take an SSRI, but honestly I don't want to do that anymore because I refuse to deal with sexual side effects, and I don't like the weight gain.  I do maintain a highly-monitored Xanax prescription (I have physical anxiety symptoms that I \*need\* to manage), but I hate having to use that, and lately it's just not doing the trick anyway.  I run and exercise and of course that helps -- it's actually a godsend -- but the effects really seem to only last when I'm actually in the act of running or lifting, etc.  I can't just run all day.

Lately, in the last few months, I've noticed that I absolutely cannot cry.  I feel this overwhelming urge for release, and I can't do it.  Even if I'm really sad, I get to the brink and then it doesn't come.  I've never experienced that before.  I'm literally researching how to cry.  Crazy.

I don't know what I'm going for here; I guess I'm just in a low place.  I'm so exhausted from the voice telling me to kill myself.  It's not leaving any room inside me for the good stuff.  I don't want to do it and won't.  But I'm just so tired."
3961,no support system,my biggest supporter is my father. lately it seems like he doesn’t want to deal with my mental illness. i called him crying &amp; he said “i don’t want to hear all that crying this early in the morning”. i asked him “would you rather me jump off a bridge or call you when i’m depressed?” he said “i can’t control what you do”...... fml. too bad i won’t be here to see how he feels when i jump off that bridge.
3962,Friend needed,Can anyone talk please I have no one and I am frightened
3963,"15m, i feel as if im completely alone and suicidal","As of the start of this year i started getting insulted by one of my friends about my appearence. My appearence is something ive seriously been insecure about for the past few years. The comments got worse and worse and he became ruder 24/7. When it got to halfway through the year i would just look in the mirror and cry about the stuff he said about me because its something i cant change.

The inults got to the point to when i decided to quit drama club because i was told i was too ugly for hollywood. 

As of the last month i flipped out at him and told him to f*ck off. He didnt understand why. My other friends in the same group noticed something was wrong. I told them everything but they just told me they werent taking sides. A week or so passed and on the news it showed that an old childhood friend of mines had been found dead in a park to suicide. This just got my anxiety levels up because i have a huge fear of death. 

And then to now. My friends are now just telling me to get over it because im apparently ruining everything. Even the guy that bullied me knows what he did and he just calls me a liar and fraud that just overreacted and wants attention. He also hasnt apologised one bit.

So i feel completely hopeless. I Started the year with tonnes of friends and now im basicly down to one or two that i rarely speak to now. I sit alone at lunch and just feel like im just ruining things for everybody.

I also have a small upcoming christmas party ive been invited to, but my bullys coming too. I just dont know how to get out of this situation"
3964,Fuck me,I’m 13 years old and my parent is in the military so I move every 2-3 years making it impossible to make good friends. All my family does is make fun of me because i have no friends(literally like I’m not even joking o just go to school and get made fun of all day.) I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and my brother calls me gay all the time because of that. I’m a litterall stick and I have arms the size of a wire. My brother always sees me crying and acting sad and just thinks I’m pretending to be depressed for attention. I know if I told my parents they would probably just try to give me to some therapist that doesn’t really care or think I’m faking it for attention. So yea like I said in the title f*ck me.
3965,The music while I was on hold with the hotline made me want it even more.,Sigh.
3966,Update 1 yr later,"I posted here a year ago and I wanted to post an update saying that i'm feeling much happier now because of this beautiful young woman who i love so much and has helped me so much in the past few months. I used to be really depressed and unhappy but now i'm loving life because of her, my bsf 💗💕"
3967,I'm going to play chicken with a train tonight,This is how it ends. I'm sure of it. But I'm scared. That's why I'm going to buy a bottle of vodka and drink until all I can do is hit the gas. This will be for the best. Everyone will move on and I'll end all of my suffering. It has to be this way. I just need to accept that.
3968,I wish I would die in my sleep,"I don't plan to commit suicide(i'm afraid that i might survive the methods and then i would be worse off), but every night I wish I would die in my sleep and every morning I'm disappointed I'm still alive."
3969,i can't do it anymore.,"my parents forced me out of college at 18. i wasn't allowed to go to college or get a job from 18-19. i was basically forced to be NEET. at 19 i was able to go to college for a couple semesters. those were the best years of my life. i turned 20 during that. i then got dropped out again. so i tried to leave, i tried to go with friends to a safe place, and they sent me so many voicemails telling me to come back. they cried into the phone. they asked if i wanted them dead. i knew they were going to hurt themselves. so i came back. and now im 21. just had a birthday with them. my friends can't help me anymore. there's no help. there's no hope. they're going to keep me here without a job and without anything no matter what i say or do. i worked really fucking hard. everyone i talk to says im just lazy and that i need to leave but they don't fucking understand. so the only logical conclusion, i think, is suicide."
3970,Death is the only answer,"Im sick of life.

18 years in this world is enough for me. Its currently 1:29 in the morning, and I can't sleep, because I want to die. Everyone who I thought was my friends are nothing but fake motherfuckers who ditch me the first chance they get. Yeah, im a bit shy, yeah I have a bit of social anxiety. Go aheah, just wander off and completely ignore me when I try to hang out with you. 

18 years old, still a virgin, never been kissed, never had anybody interested in me, no matter how much I try, yet all you bigot cunts are helping each other get the girls you want but not me.

Yes, i have a job and I enjoy it very much, I just don't enjoy living.

I picture myself in a happy place, a beautiful landscape, in front of a still lake, standing on the green grass, inhaling the cool, rainy moist air, with the girl of my dreams with me.... i can only get there if I die.

Im sick of this world punishing me for trying to be a good person. All I wanted was to be liked. Screw you planet earth... if there is a hell, we all live there already."
3971,How to cure sadness when you’re young and don’t have money?,"I cleaned my room for the first time in months and drink a lot of water now. I’m trying to fix my sleep schedule now but even after everything I still feel sad.


What else can I do?


 **I don’t have access to therapy, so please don’t mention that as an option."
3972,How are you suppose to deal,"I've been suicidal before, and yet I still have no idea how I'm suppose to deal with this. If I go to the hospital I'll lose my job, money, everything I've worked for. If I die my parents will forever be heartbroken. I dont really know what I'm suppose to do."
3973,Advice?,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask but I've tried to OD recently. I regret it a lot now because I feel like fucking shit. I thought it would be a quick death or something but I'm so wrong. I feel so sick. Should I go tell my parents that I tried to OD on their meds and go to the hospital? I don't know because I'd feel bad to ruin my parents and everyone else's say because we're supposed to have a Christmas party today. Should I wait to tell my parents, should I just tell them right away or should I just ignore it and hope for the best? I don't know if I'm just feeling like ""hang-over symptoms to be honest. I have the worst headache, my hearts like IDK, I was vomiting earlier in the morning, I feel dizzy, I've been feeling week and I think I'm having low iron. Should I tell my parents? I don't know because if I go to a hospital, I don't want to get transferred out my high school because they think I won't be able to take it or something. I also don't want to get sent to some mental hospital(sorry I don't know what they're called).

While going through this shit, it made me realize that what I tried to do wasn't worth it and I'm really regretting it. What should I do?"
3974,Goddamn car is going to ruin my life,If I can't afford to fix it I don't know what I'll do. How are people supposed to get around without a car? I don't know what the best fucking decision is and I don't know if this will be the straw that breaks the camel's back. I'm fucking sick of this life. I don't understand how people can be okay with suffering through this shit.
3975,Can I tell my therapist I'm suicidal without being sent to the psych ward?,"I want to kill myself. I have my letters written and my will sorted out mostly- just a piece of paper dispersing everything. I know how I wanna go but not the date just sometime soon. If I tell the therapist this, are they gonna send me to the hospital. It's my first meeting with them. Thanks."
3976,Maybe this will help you - the power of music,"Hey guys-

I'm a 12-year-old boy and recently one of my best friends told me they wanted to suicide.

I didn't know what to do but - I ended up making her a song. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjuyYVcawMY&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjuyYVcawMY&amp;feature=youtu.be)

It's called ""Dead Roses"". It might help you get better if you are serious about it. Remember, you're not alone, and I hope you enjoy the song."
3977,Does anyone else get really intrusive thoughts about suicide that seem to come out of nowhere?,"I could be in a staff meeting, or singing jingle bells with the choir and get suddenly pulled away in these dark thoughts and visualise myself hanging from a rope or jumping in a river. It takes me away for a few moments before I come back into the room and realise I'm still singing jingle bells. Or before when I'd see a tree I'd think oh that's pretty. But now all I think is ""can I hang from there?"" These thoughts make me feel like I'm being summoned. They're very intrusive and I can't control them. Anyone else been the same?"
3978,i contemplated suicide,i almost killed myself. redditor’s say they tried to die by using a belt and hanging themselves. so i tried that. i put the belt on a hanging rack on my door and i was this close to jumping. but my brother opened the door (he’s 19) and i scrambled to get off the chair and get my head out of the belt. he looked at me and looked at the door. i don’t know if he knew that i just tried to kill myself. he told me that i should put my trench coat back on my hanging rack and asked if i wanted cereal.
3979,I've made my mind up. All I need is a method now.,"You know, I've tried. I went to counselling, the counsellor send me to a therapist. I went to therapy; I was always on time, did all my homework. The therapist bailed on me. My psychiatrist wants me to contact him, yet he rarely answers my emails. I have no one to turn to. The counsellor wants to send me to an outpatient program st a day clinic, my mother threw a hissy fit when I told her. So that's no option either, especially since I have an internship scheduled for the time he wanted to send me. But I don't know if I can do it. Or my presentations. Or my exams.

I haven't properly slept in 3 weeks. It's either worries or nightmares that keep me up. It's all too much. Too much. I have headaches all day long, I keep dissociating, I just want to hurt myself so I can escape that feeling of hopelessness for a bit. And not just scratching with a scissor, like I did before. I want to cut deep. I want to draw blood. These thoughts torture me.

I feel so alone. I can't take it anymore. I can't. I'm so so sorry. I've really tried. But as so often, my hardest isn't good enough. Never was."
3980,It's the only way out,"I've been going to therapy for 7 years and took countless meds. Nothing works. The only way to escape my mind is to die. I'm tired of living with bpd. I'm a burden to everyone, I know it."
3981,i need some advice,I've been talking to a therapist for a few months now and things haven't got better. I always feel like maybe she thinks i'm just doing it for attention which i know is super dumb because shes so nice so its probably the depression talking. But on Wednesday i spoke to her and told her I was 99% feeling like i wanted to die and it was a brief meeting and I walked out sorta not really feeling heard. That night I went home and took an overdose attempting to end my life which didn't work sadly. I ended up telling a teacher who I trust about it the next day and they told my therapist (who works at school) but i now know that the amount of medicine i took wouldn't have killed me anyways so i'm scared the'll think it was an attention thing because I told them about it. How can I get the courage to let them know I don't feel like i'm getting enough support without sounding ungrateful for the help i'm getting atm?
3983,my fear,so the last time i tried to kill myself i tried overdosing on otc painkillers and it obviously didn’t work because i ended up puking for the next 7 hours but since i tried overdosing on my regular painkillers i now developed a fear of even taking them and it probably won’t even work on me anymore so ya kids that wasn’t fun
3984,Life is just shit..,"I fucking hate life... I been throw a lot in my life. Broken Engagement, had to leave my dream job training cause I felt ""I wasn't ready"".. finally got a good job to pay bills... I just got let go bull shit reason.

I feel killing myself is best answer, I feel I should of killed myself when my fiancee left when I was going throw a hard time back then. I honestly think I'm just here to kill myself.."
3985,I’m not “suicidal” but I chain smoke. All. Day. Long. And I am so lonely.,"I have no family. Don’t like any of my “friends.” Have no hobbies.  

I like .....  um. Wine and food.  Occasionally going to a movie by myself.


My kid has anxiety and is horrible company.  

I look forward to absolutely nothing."
3986,Sorry but I couldn’t make a crosspost,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/e7e34n/6_days_left_until_i_kill_myself/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
3987,I’m doing it,"I’m driving to beachy head right now. I have 4 packs of aspirin, my favourite foods and an old stuffed toy I’m going to sit there are take them if they don’t work I’ll jump off the cliff. It should be pretty up there."
3988,"I feel suicidal, i'm scared and can't ask for help","i am a guy from the middle east, in our society ""suicide"" is a major taboo in Islamic culture, as such there isn't much support for people with suicidal thoughts like hotlines or anonymous groups.   

the issue is barely acknowledged to exist, and numbers are inaccurate due to some suicide cases being ruled as accidents not suicide (probably families don't want the ""shame"" of having someone committed suicide in the family, so they bribe or pressure the coroner to change the cause of death)   

i have anxiety issues so i can't communicate with others which means i have no friends, the only people in my life i can talk to without breaking down are my family (i still live with them because it is ok to live with your family until you start your own family in our culture)  

i have fully withdrawn from society at this point, i spend my day on my computer playing video games or watching videos, i have failed my college exams so many times and repeated several years (i'm 26 years old and still in 3rd year of college)    

because of my life style, i have gained weight so while i'm not obese i am still fat   

they never tell me but i can see them look at me like a failure, which even i think of myself as a failure 

i have this recurring suicide thought every day more than once, me using a knife to kill myself, i usually ignore it and just distract myself with games or a movie or something  

today, i got into a fight with my family because they misunderstood something i said and even after i explained they still are angry with me, this jacked up the level of my depression and i found myself waiting for them to leave the house so i can carry out my thoughts   

i don't have anyone i can talk to since i don't have friends and my family doesn't really believe me even though 5 years ago, i was alone in the house and got a knife from the kitchen and was about to do it when my brother who had just left came back cause he forgot something   

back then my family got really angry with me for trying to kill myself as to be expected in this kind of society    

ever since then, whenever there was an argument there would always be the line ""don't even think about saying you are suicidal"" as if i'm doing it to get attention 

i wanted to write this to let out all of the emotions i have been bottling up deep inside for the last few years"
3989,"17m, I want to kill myself but have no method to do so","I am so sick of all these medical problems. I can't even live my life and they keep getting worse. Thing is, they don't kill me. I wish I was dead. I compiled all of my pills together, I was going to OD but they are not lethal enough and overdose with these pills don't kill you as I read from articles. Only thing I was blessed with is good looks. Other than that I am stupid, I have health problems both mentally and physically. Life in general is not worth living for me. I tried to enjoy everything in this world for a year or so. It is not worth it. I wish I had a method to kill myself. I don't have enough pills. I lost the one dearest to me because of a stupid thing I have done. I wish I had a good painless suicide method. Please tell me an easy way that I can perform even right now."
3990,Asking for a friend,"So I have a friend who's already attempted multiple times before.
Recently their doctor gave them a new med against depression or anxiety or something, but the first few days side effects got my friend in extreme anxiety and they almost attempted twice (I actually haven't heard from them since they almost attempted this morning and am a little worried).
I don't know how to handle this, how to help them.
I feel so powerless.
All I can do is watch.
Can you help me help them?"
3992,Why am I like this,I don't know who to talk to but I am fucked in the head
3993,Today is the day.,I can't do this anymore. I'm not that much of a strong person. I'm ready. I've written my notes. All that's left is to tie the noose and do it.
3994,Im feeling closer,I can’t keep going on feeling like this. Im feeling ready to kill myself
3995,I just want to die,"I‘m not even desperate or feeling tortured, I just legit want to die. I‘m just done."
3996,...,"Feeling unappreciated. 
Like people won’t accept me for who I am. 
That I’m uninteresting and a burden.

I’m tired of acting happy.
I’m tired of living.
I want to leave... but fear stops me.

I don’t want to hurt my family.
I don’t get treated well.
Emotions hold me back.

Nothing excites me.
My future ambitions are gone.
I love sleeping because it’s the closest thing to death.
 
I’ve started working out, eating healthier.
A lot of things I want are given to me.
I’m thankful for all of it, but that won’t save me.

I just want love.
From anyone. 
A family member, perhaps a friend or stranger.

But I feel that even if I find love it won’t be enough.
When will I ever be satisfied?
I guess I’m stuck here until natural events are the end of me..."
3997,Ready to go,Nothing left
3998,Fuck my life,I'm drunk scrambling with a knife in my bedroom destroying things. I wish I didn't know anybody like my friends or family so I could kill myself without hurting people I care about. Fucking fuck everything life is just a struggle and my personality just isn't fit. I want to stab myself in a hot bath and sleep forever ht the people I care about are my only will. Fuck myself and Fucking fuck fuck fuck fuck yduen4vgri Zaza o asha ok e nfb 4vri zdx jvc 3. i jvm ahxj ever uxn s sixon wha eva hi gi3b ETF ver hsiow on 4
3999,"I'm so desperate, I just need someone to accept my decision and be with me until the end","I don't even want to die. I just genuinely can't keep living like this, it's too much pain. My whole existence is nothing but pain. I can't ever take a break from it.
I know that I need to die. Logically I should have already died some months ago, but due to the fact that suicide is fucking hard, I'm still here.
I am terrified of thinking about it. I didn't manage to pick my method yet, but I can't make it to 2020, I just can't.
I'm so fucked, it scares me.
I do nothing all day instead of trying to prepare myself for my end, but I'm unable to.

I don't want to go through this alone.
There's absolutely no life for me left already, although I'm just turning 19..
It's for sure.
I fucking tried my hardest already, there really is nothing left.
I wish it all wouldn't have to be this way.

I could really use someone to talk to.."
