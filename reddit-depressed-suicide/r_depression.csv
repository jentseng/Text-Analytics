0,Not sure if I'm being annoying and overbearing or if I should contact her,"This semester a friend of mine has skipped several days of classes.  I asked her privately if she had depression and told me she did.  I let her know that I also have depression and would be open to talk.  The next week she actually comes to all of our classes, but then is very absent again afterwards.  I email her again and she tells me things have gotten worse, but she's getting through it.  I let her know again that I'm there for her, but didn't hear anything from her.  

My depression got worse too and I felt like I was being very overbearing and annoying and she thought wasn't messaging me back because I seemed like a creep.  I honestly wanted to talk to her, or any friend irl, about my depression.  She shows up last couple class periods and I try not to talk her much.  Both of just finished our finals and she was going to graduate this semester, but now isn't sure.  

I don't know if I should send her a message because I already sent her 2 and she never went into detail about stuff or reached back out.  She also has a bf and I don't want to make the impression that I want to ask her out.  Also not sure if my own depression is altering my view of the situation."
1,Why can't I just be homeless and die in the cold,I dont want to work I dont want to get up I dont want to take a shower I dknt want to clean my room I'd rather have no responsibility and just die where no one cares about me
2,I’m better,"I’d officially better and I’m ready to leave this subreddit. People have helped me so much and I feel great, happy, and content about life."
3,i have therapy and i’m not going,"i’ve got a therapy appointment in 1 hour and i really can’t bring myself to go. i received the initial text confirming the appointment 3 days ago and i confirmed but i can’t cancel because this is already a rescheduled appointment from the last time i cancelled and honestly i can’t make up an excuse this time. i just feel too anxious to leave the house but i feel if i text her that she won’t accept it as an excuse? 
idk this is mainly just a vent"
4,This one girl has actually driven me into depression,"This girl and I had known each other for a while now, we get on well in real life but on the internet she would ignore my texts, even though I only ever asked her about assignments and stuff regarding college. Anyways I managed to get her number (asked her irl) and sent her a text about class which again she would ignore. 

After a while I felt a bit disrespected and would completely blank her in real life when we see each other. You can tell she would look my way to say hi but I wouldn’t even give her eye contact. This continued for a few days, and one other time I felt like I overdid it because we were talking in a group and I was flirting with everyone in the room (mostly girls) without acknowledging her, and you can tell she was visibly upset. When I ignored her multiple times irl, I eventually greeted her. Then I sent her a bunch of texts basically apologizing but indirectly, saying “This is the last year of college, I don’t want you to be mad at me...i’ll delete your number and I don’t need you to respond, just be safe and good luck.”...she read the texts and actually called me on the phone, she was nice and explained to me that the reason she ignored my texts before was because she had a boyfriend and she is trying to respect their relationship by not talking to other male friends (even though my texts were only ever about class, it’s worth noting). I made sure I was understanding and we ended the call on a really good note. I honestly thought that was it...that she had a bf and I wouldn’t contact her ever, which I didn’t. 

But then a week later when I saw her in class, she walked past me and ignored me..,which I found weird but didn’t think much of it. And then another week later she texts me herself for the first time and says “you’re a great person and if you need anything for class feel free to hit me up”...isn’t her behavior a bit weird or am I imagining things? I honestly just can’t tell.
 
How would u interpret a text like that? And I know it’s likely something harmless, but man now I can’t stop thinking about her and I have to see her every fucking day it’s so depressing. And worse yet I try to do my best to avoid eye contact but she keeps looking at me to greet me.."
5,A helping hand would be nice,"I'm bad at expressing my emotions it'll probably take me ages to even come up with one paragraph of complaints about my life. When really I don't, I have a good family, I live in a good town surrounded by good people. I have everything I have and more but I feel greedy for being in their presence. I feel sick knowing that the time they spent with me is probably wasted and they only waste their time with me because no one else will. I distract myself with things like video games, tasks, helping my parents and grandparents. And yet I feel nothing, no satisfaction in anything. Nothing makes me want to do anything but lay and just wait for the universe to snatch me out of existence. I don't even know if I have depression, I'm too scared to even admit it to a friend nevermind a doctor or my parents. I'm afraid they will be scared to do anything with me and treat me like a different person afterwards. I hope some people relate and sorry for bad spellings/grammar mistakes I'm not the smartest person"
6,is it normal to feel bad about yourself every single day of your life about your appearance ?,"so to start this off i am (m) 15 . i have acne that is mild meaning my face isn’t clear but it isn’t bad. it sometimes flares up and it’s whatever i could care less about the acne. what really is on my mind 24/7 about my appearance is this discolored part on my chin. on that same spot is where i picked and scabbed the most because there were these tiny annoying pimples that kept popping up and whenever i popped them they came back. i did everything to try to get rid of them and that led to nowhere because i still have them and that came with a downside. because of that (i think im not sure) my chin is now somewhat discolored. it’s not that noticeable as before but it’s just there , it’s like rosacea but just dark and only on my chin. i went to a doc appointment and mentioned it but they just brushed it off as nothing and gave me something to reduce the redness and darkness but it didn’t do anything. im just so insecure about that i don’t wear anything that is bright or lightly colored, i stick to dark colors and such. i just hate it , it’s always on my mind 24/7 and it just gets the best of me sometimes. i stress so much over it and as soon as i look in the mirror my day is completely ruined."
7,How to deal with society trying to get me to kill myself?,"This time of year can be awful. People are so mean. I remember in school the people who bullied me would always amp up the cruelty right before the holiday break, steal my things or vandalize or tell me something permanently scarring. 

A woman was nice to me at the store today and I almost cried because it feels like it never happens. Usually people just are cold or deliberately cruel most of the time. They tell me I'm ugly all the time and I'm worthless almost everyday and to die. It's messed me up. I'm having suicidal urges right now."
8,Feel like dying,"I’m applying to law school, still haven’t sent in my apps and my numbers suck so I won’t get in anywhere to which I’m applying to. All I had was applying early, and now I don’t even have that. On top of that, I’m realizing problems in my relationship that I can’t deal with till after the holidays and I know it’s going to lead to heartbreak. I can’t keep living at home because home life is awful. Everyday it’s something else, something worse, my life progressively just feels worse. It’s like the universe is shitting on me, and I feel like dying. I really just want to jump off a cliff. I’m sick of everything, not even petting my dog is making me feel better. This life is a joke and nothing is good in this world."
9,My all time favourite song. Its gotten me through alot of shit. I just wanted to share it here and hopefully it can help you even just a little.,https://youtu.be/P2GU66c2hJw
10,Will 34 200mg Ibuprofen kill me without fail?,I just need confirmation before I do permanent and regrettable damage. Feasibly this is the most I can manage in one sitting but I am willing to double it for certainty.
11,I'm suicidal and my mental health is really bad.,I'm thinking about suicide every hour of the day I even tested hanging and almost broke my neck. I don't wanna go back to a psychiatric ward I don't know what to do.
12,We can just be friends I guess,I don't even know what I did wrong. One minute everything is fine and now she wont talk to me. I want to give up on everything work school art fuck this
14,Lost family,Wifes been cheating on me for years now still denies it even with the proof I've found. Decided that I'm done and now I have to figure out how to deal with my children in a destroyed family thanks to her.
15,Pretty Much A Night Owl,"Its 1:17am currently in England I haven't been sleeping properly for close to a week now so I thought this might be a nice opportunity to make friends from around the world and also help anyone who would like to get things off their mind. I am happy to help where ever I possibly can, so feel free to message me if you would like to chat."
16,Why are small steps so hard?,"So I’ve posted here before and I’m really trying to be better. But I feel like I’m in this really weird pattern.

For a week I’ll do really well. 
Eat healthy. 
Take showers daily.
Brush my teeth.
Want to go out and do things 
Do small things to feel human.

Then the following week, it’s back to the same old. 
Don’t feel like putting the effort in. In anything. 
Home. Appearance. Work I do a fake it until I make it type thing. 
Social life is gone.

It’s weird. It’s like a strange manic episode. 
The latter will last for weeks or months. 
But when I’m in a good mindset it only lasts a week. And it sucks.

And when the clouds come back, as I call it, it’s so hard to function. 
I don’t have the mental energy, emotion or strength to do something simple as brush my teeth or my hair. 
I remember I went almost two weeks without washing my hair. 
And when I finally did it made me feel worse because I’m like “How did I let myself get like this?”

I just want to feel normal again. 

I don’t want to feel like taking small steps is a lot. It shouldn’t feel like a lot. It should feel like something you’re SUPPOSED to do. 

But, it’s something that I’ve grown used to for years. 

And I’m scared that it’s something that will never change."
18,When everyone still treats you like you're a straight A student,"and you feel even more guilty for not being one anymore but then you don't want to tell anyone that things have changed because your entire identity was getting good grades and you miss it and are afraid that any other identity as good/don't know what else your identity could be

#relateable
Am I right?"
19,How to talk about depression with family ?,"I seem to have a hard time talking about being depressed to my family, mostly because I don't want them to feel bad. I'm not sure how to open up. How do I go about doing this ?"
20,"I feel so alone, as if I don't exist at all.","I've been feeling a lot more depressed lately, and I am certain in correlates with my social life. 

For some background: I am in a very small healthcare field program. There is less than 15 people in my class. When I began the program I fell in with a group, and we became fast friends. 4 months in, the suddenly stopped talking to me and I still have no idea why. So I went to the other group in the class, and they never fully accepted me. They are all super close, and have very loud and rambunctious personalities, while I'm more quiet and calm. I accepted that I would never fully be part of their group and was fine just sitting by them at lunch. Today that all ended. Some people in that group were absent so I sat with them. We had an all day study day. For the past month now, the tables have been arranged differently so that its no longer one large table, but 6 small ones. I sat with them, and they all moved to the table I usually sit at alone. One girl stayed while we studied, and then joined them at lunch, so I was all alone. I felt so devastated and humiliated, so I ate my lunch and went to a study room alone. I fought back tears for the rest of the day and then cried at home. 

I'm not a bad person, and I don't understand why no one wants to be around me. I'm supportive and always there for others, and yet everyone shits on me. Days like this really make me wish I had never been born."
22,Im 100% emotionally numb and that caused me musical anhedonia which I HATE,"Music is my life but idk what happened on November that I became emotionally numb and now music is just like noise to me, nothing fires. I wasn’t a depresive person but did have anxiety issues. And I’m not talking about mild numbness, I literally feel no positive or negative emotions along with anhedonia, nothing gives me pleasure. Has anyone overcome this?"
23,I have succumbed to hate,"I actually don’t know how to start this, so I guess I’ll just write off the top of my head. I’ve been struggling with mild/moderate/severe depression my whole life, gradually getting worse and worse though out the years. Growing up I never felt happy, I guess I have never really felt happiness, only joy in the moment, and my parents seem to agree. I can not remember a single time in my life that I have felt genuinely happy, besides if I laugh at a joke or something similar. Only a few people know of my depression (about 3 people excluding my family). I’ve always just been sad. I remember when I was I kid, I would pray that one day I would learn to understand people, without blatantly asking them. I saw it as some divine power. I’ve never really been exceptionally good at making friends, always having about 1-2 (rarely 3) people that I would consider friends wherever I moved to. The friendship would always result in just fading away over the years, since I either moved away or the other way around. I’ve always found comfort in music, which resulted in me recording and releasing my own music now. It has given me a type of comfort that no other interest has given me before. It is comforting and discomforting at the same time, if that makes sense. I have only recently been diagnosed as slightly autistic (not as in not being able to function in society, only mildly when it comes to opening up to people which I think there’s probably a lot of people on the spectrum that has not been diagnosed yet. I can’t help to speculate if that’s the reason I react how I react. I can’t even put a finger on it, it’s just very specific things that trigger me. A person can say that I’m a complete piece of shit and I wouldn’t care even if that person means something to me, but that same person can say one little thing and my mind just flies outta my head. I have recently grown more and more angry and aggressive. I walk by someone and I just really feel like punching them in the face. The person has done nothing to me and this is most likely the first time encountering them, but somehow I feel the sudden urge to beat them up. I have attempted suicide once a long time ago when I was 13. A blessing and I curse at the same time. I have always thought about death and dying, about killing myself. Recently I been thinking more and more about it. Thinking of ways to do it quietly as to not wake anybody up at night. I have no logical reason as to not be happy. I have a steady job with decent pay, I can afford most stuff I want, I have friends and family that love me and vise versa. But it hurts. I hurts so much. Sometimes I walk around outside at 3 am just to feel the freezing weather to make sure I am not dead. The pain is becoming insufferable. My chest hurts and I get short of breath when I think about life. I cry uncontrollably constantly. I hold onto nothing when I sleep to the illusion that someone is there for me."
24,I realise how different it could have been.,"We celebrated one of my little brothers 11th birthday yesterday. (I'm 26 for context) I went to my fathers house after work. I was talking with their mum and just watching my siblings. I saw how different they are to when I was their age. They were genuinly happy and they have personality and able to enjoy themselves

Before then it was custody battles and changing house every other week due to court orders. And just the over all general anger from my parents and their conflicts toll on myself and my sister. Im just a shrivelled hull jammed full of depression compared to them. And that they will grow up to be normal happy people, when I can barely function as a far below average human at the best of times."
25,I don't understand why I'm so depressed with my job,"My job is not mentally demanding, people generally speaking are nice, great managers, ok coffee, cool restaurants nearby...

But I still feel sad and depressed, in always tired and wanting to go back home/never wanting to leave bed.

I'm good at the job, again, it's not mentally demanding...
I don't want to move up, I just want to be paid and go home at the end of the day

I'm always waiting for the end of the month so I get my salary, not because I need the money but because I get this type of ""high"" from it. But after a a day or two (if not less), that high is gone and I go back to square one.

Maybe it's because I have to pretend all the time, but apparently is not working but everyone can see I'm depressed all the time.

I tried to be more energetic, but I get too energetic to the point I hate who I am and I'm annoying to other people...

I have no talent for anything so it's not like I can turn a hobbie into a career.

I hate myself and I'm not happy about my life.
All I wanna do is cry and not talk to anyone.

I want to isolate myself so bad. Fuck people, fuck everyone. I wanna be left alone...."
26,I think it's finally time to try and I mean for once in my life actually try,"I'm one of those people that let the world and everyone surrounding them shit on them and beat them to the ground until there is nothing left. Today I had a manic breakdown in front of my mother and admitted for the first time that I had attempted suicide 3 times. I know some part of me realized how fucked up that was to say, but I get so pissed off at everyone and everything that I just snap sometimes and can't help myself. I am a docile and typically nice person at least I would like to think. My unspoken rule that no one follows is that if I treat you with respect I expect the same in return, and I know its pretty common but I am someone who is disregarded, bullied, and ostracized quite frankly because of my skin color. I am called a carpet maker, Ikbal, Baljeet, and gas station worker. I can't help but wonder if there is some hope for me in the future and whether I will accomplish something or not, but the way I see the world I think it just seems to want to make me lose any hope. I feel like a burden and an embarrassment to my family and the feeling has done nothing but amplify the last 2 years and is showing absolutely no signs of slowing down. I constantly fuck up and I'm trying not to because of how important my future is. I don't want to be living in suburban and racist ass Kentucky my whole damn life. So as much as I hate myself and self deprecate I know that if I don't get out of here then I will be stuck forever in one spot never going anywhere. I know what it's like to feel hopeless, sad, annoyed with the world, and just disappointed, but today which has been one of the worst days of my life I realize that no one is gonna be able to pull me out of this place except myself and myself alone. I know a support system is great and I highly encourage you to use it if your family or friends are available to talk, but I know now that you yourself, and this is also including me, need to pull ourselves out of whatever is holding us back and follow-through in big or small steps because no matter what progress is progress. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
27,I can't communicate or form proper relationships,"I'm autistic and I've lost all my IRL friends over the past year and I don't really know how to make new ones. 
Back in high school you sort of got funneled towards similar people and you got to see people every day even if they were just your aquaintances, but now that I've graduated they all cut me off and I feel like I can't start again. 
Online friends don't help, as they always last like two or three days and then ghost me. I feel so inescapably lonely and I just want to leave :( 
Anyone else in a similar situation?"
28,Feeling just dreadful enough,"Anyone else get into a mental state where you have to be feeling just terrible enough to put on your favorite depressing song or artist. I'm not particularly good at explaining it, but often when I'm borderline suicidial (much of the time of late), I'll put on say Elliot Smith. I connect with the song(s) at some deeper level, and come away feeling briefly better if that's what to call it, yet still awful. Maybe it makes me feel less alone or more understood, if only briefly. Other times it can backfire, and actually make me more determined to kill myself at some point (thanks Radiohead)."
29,Family is a fucking scam,And bullshit
30,Advice,"Hi everyone I am looking for some life advice for the current situation I am in. All feedback is welcome!

I am a 22/M who graduated college this past May with a Business Degree. Shortly after graduating I took a job offer from one of my family members across the country. Fortunately my college girlfriend of a year who graduated the same semester as me lived only a few hours away from my new job. Everything seemed to be working out perfectly and I was happy that my girlfriend and I would be able to stay together after graduating.

From this point on this is where things start to go downhill. I didn't realize that this job I took required more hours than a standard 40 hour a week job. It was normal to have a 60-70/ week with 1 day off. Like I mentioned my girlfriend lived a few hours away and we were planning on spending our weekends together. Since my only day off was Sunday every time I drove out to visit her it felt like an extremely short and rushed trip. I was doing what I had to do to make it work, but she started to become frustrated with the situation we were in. I understood her frustration because the situation really did suck and there was no end in sight. We did this for a few months and ended up having a really sad breakup (she broke up with me). We both wanted to be with each other, but the long distance was killing us and there was no end in sight.

At this point I really started to hate the situation I was in. I was in a random state with no friends working 60-70 hours a week for a company I hated while suffering from a breakup. I worked for another month after the breakup before throwing in the towel and realizing I needed to go back to my home state.

I return to my home state eager to start fresh and get a new job working for a company I actually like. I was also excited to be back with my friends and family after going through this really hard breakup. Unfortunately for me all my friends were busy with there new careers and they put me on the back burner. These were guys that I have been friends with for years and who I have always been there for after tragic life events. It really bothered me that after going through this bad breakup and job experience none of them even cared that I was home or reached out to see how I was doing. I also didn't realize how much I would hate living in my parents house again. My parents are great people, but they have a certain way of doing things and after living on my own in college for 4 years I developed my own independence. Despite having so much change in my life I knew that I needed to find a job to keep my mind occupied. I was pretty confident I would find employment shortly after returning home. I have a degree, internship experience, work experience and I conduct myself rather well. I thought landing a job working for a company I liked would be cake.

I have been applying for jobs for 3 months now and I cant even get an interview... I am receiving rejection letter after rejection letter and I have become extremely negative towards everything and everyone. To make matters worse my friends are all busy with their lives and still have not reached out to see how I am doing. I have spent everyday these past 3 months stuck inside my house applying for jobs and stressed with my only activity outside of the house being the gym. At first all of this was a shock to me. I went from having tons of friends in college, a great girlfriend, and goals to being alone all day with no friends, no job and an ex girlfriend who has moved on and seems to be happy with life. Now it just seem like this is the new normal.

I feel like my world is completely upside down and this is not what I had visioned after graduating. All my friends seem to be happy with their lives and here I am struggling to find motivation after so much rejection. I say this humbly, but I have always been someone who is ahead of everyone else my age and now that I seem to be behind its killing me. I have not been happy with my life since graduation and for the first time ever I feel somewhat depressed. I have distanced myself from my friends and have not been in contact with my ex girlfriend after breaking up. I am trying my hardest to remain optimistic about the future. I am hoping I get hired after the holiday season passes assuming thats when companies will be looking to hire. I have hit rock bottom and I am fortunate to have a great family, but I am so negative despite what they say my mindset stays the same.

\- Has anyone been in a similar situation?

\- Are my feeling normal?

\- What is your take on my situation?

\- All feedback is appreciated!"
31,Soon to be abandoned,"My family is moving to another country, and leaving me to finish college. They say its for my future, but I can tell they just want to get away from my depressed ass. I am only loved by my SO and if even my family can't stand me I wonder how long this will last. I will soon be abandoned by everyone. I feel so unloved and useless. I wish I would just die already or completely dissapear."
32,Im sad and lonely,I can’t find happiness anymore I only find temporary like when I go out with my friends but that’s about it I just want someone to love and someone to love me back but it’s hard because I’m scared of getting rejected or that I don’t live up to there expectations and I stopped trying. Exams at school are coming up and I have been skipping class and when I come to work I feel different idk man I feel down for no reason is it because I’m lonely idk but I’m only 17 and I don’t know what to do
33,"Depressed people, what makes you smile?","I know that may be the your rarest activity but are there any moments when you smile? I mean actually, genuinely smile. Share your reasons!"
35,Getting back with my ex-girlfriend,I and my ex broke up about a week and a half ago. it was fairly mutual between us and we are on good terms however I want her back. we have spoken in person about everything. I asked how she has been since the break up she said she's not over it but has accepted that it happened and she wants to work on herself. we said we have missed each other in the week we broke up and I told her that she is the one I want and no one else and I will wait for her. she said she doesn't want me to wait because she doesn't know how long it will take for her to be okay with herself and she doesn't want me to feel guilty if I meet someone else even though it will suck and hurt if I do she said. we spoke about what would happen if we gave it a second try that things would need to change for it to work out next time. she didn't want to take her jumper back and said that she will swap the one I have now of hers for another one that I used to steal and wear all the time after Christmas.  I asked for a hug because I love this girl to the moon and back and she said she still cares and loves me as well. and before she left she said hopefully when she is ready I haven't moved on. but right now she doesn't know what she wants and wants some space. I'm hoping to work with her and get back with her when she is ready but does this sound like its a possibility of happening?
36,My life has been spiraling and idk what to do,"Repost from r/offmychest

I don’t know when exactly all of this started but I am a complete mess. I’ve always suffered from depression and anxiety, but over the past year they have become crippling. I’ve tried so many medications without any relief. They have slowly taken over every aspect of my life and I don’t know what to do at this point.

I’m a resident physician and my symptoms have impaired my ability to handle the administrative aspect of my job to the point that I am being threatened probation which is board reportable and will follow me the rest of my career. I don’t know how to prioritize my own healthcare when I have patients that I feel like need me more than I need myself. I don’t have anyone to advocate for me in my training and because of the shame I experience it’s difficult to advocate for myself.

I’m in a relationship with a partner who does not understand mental health and will consistently poke at my insecurities/anxieties rather than support me through them despite countless times of me telling him what I need. Even if I left him I feel as though he would emotionally drag me down even further past this rock bottom out of spite. I’ve never had a partner in my life who has truly made me feel like I was enough or worthy of receiving the same love that I try to give.

My mom and my sister talk to me frequently, but don’t understand how crippling my symptoms are and expect me to bounce back from this any day. I don’t speak with my dad after he told me that I was a disappointment and he wanted nothing to do with me after I came out as gay. I have a puppy who is my world and if it weren’t for him I doubt I would even still be here right now.

It gives me anxiety even making this post because I’m sure it sounds like I am just looking for attention. Maybe I am, idk. I just feel so alone and had nowhere else to let out these feelings."
37,Oh god someone talk to me,"I'm drunk, I'm angry, I'm every kind of thing that could lead to an awkward conversation, so let's talk 🤣"
38,"Quitting Sertaline via Cold Turkey, Help Please","I, (22/M), have been taking sertaline for about 7 months. Of the 7 months, my first 3 months I was taking 50mg, and the remaining 4 I’ve been taking 100mg (having yet to miss a dosage). Feel like my depression hasn’t really gone away, I mainly feel numb to things, decreased 
libido/sex drive which I suspect is tied to my motivation, or LACK thereof. 

I really just can’t bare taking this drug anymore, I don’t want to rely on it to give me my sense of being/worth which I originally, atleast in part, thought it would. 

I consider my self to be wildly ambitious, and whilst being on sertaline I feel so drained of vigour, and consumed by feelings of lethargy and apathy, ESPECIALLY when it comes to doing things I know are in my best interest or will benefit me in the long run. 


So, I say this all to say that I’ve gone cold turkey, as of tonight, and I’m wondering what I can expect to experience/prepare for considering my time on sertaline and if there’s anything I can do to offset or curb the withdrawals, besides tapering off which I know is recommended but my psychiatrist is available only 3 times of the week with less than 3hrs during those days, which means she’s terribly booked up. Thus, resulting in this post and me making the decision to act on something I’ve wanted to do for last 1-2 months."
39,I’m just done,"I’ve been dealing with depression for years now. I thought my boyfriend would be there since he’s been my best friend for years. He’s been at work out of state for two weeks and I haven’t responded to his texts because I wasn’t answering anyone and didn’t want him to worry about me. Well this morning he broke up with me and there’s nothing I can do. I was looking forward to having our first Christmas together with him being home. I’m devastated and don’t know where to go. I’m relapsing into my suicidal state. I just spent half an hour in the bath waiting to slit my wrists and choke down a bottle of pills. I couldn’t find the courage to do it. He’s the only man I’ve ever loved and I have for a fourth of my life. I’m 19 and met him when I was 14. I’m so lost. My friends and family say he was emotionally abusive and cheating on me. I ignored the red flags, and I still would if he told me he loved me and still wanted me. I just want to be held in his arms again. I love this man with all my heart. I just feel like there’s no way out of this pain."
40,Does anyone want to voice chat me?,We can call each other over discord or something. It’s about girl problems and depression and just life. I really need a friend right now. And a friend I thought I had is apparently too busy smoking weed which is a bigger priority than helping a friend.
41,Anyone else not know WHY you feel like you do?,"I don't know why I feel like I do. I just know I'm a 35 year old male who just feels tired all the damn time, being social and meeting people just drains me for days after. I quite often drive home from work and just want to cry and I have no idea why as my life isn't hard or bad in any way shape or form. 

I guess I'm just hoping there's others like this. Who just want the world to swallow them up peacefully leaving no trace but have no idea why."
43,Work is so depressing,I just hate how so much of my precious time is going towards shit that I don’t give a fuck about. I don’t want to be here and yet I’m forced to be here because otherwise it’s starvation on the cold hard cement. Don’t people see that this shit is slavery? I wish I could have my basic needs met so I wouldn’t have to suffer so much at work. Seriously I’m just not the type of person who was meant to play in this corporate hellhole. Not only do I really hate working but I’m extremely socially awkward so that makes it even less likely for me to succeed here. Fuck work.
44,I feel so stress and so angry,I feel so much sad like every day I’m crying i lost my friends cus of my jealous they was talking too much with my boyfriend and boyfriend is refuse talking to me like the way he talking to them he was ignore me too much i even did everything for him but he left me I feel stuck and alone and anything I want is just someone else take it away from me or isn’t happy about it and leave me with feeling like this
45,Flat life,"I didn’t know where to go with this. It looks like I’m successfully fighting depression. I don’t want to die anymore. I don’t feel hopeless and empty and I don’t feel like constantly falling. I barely remember what I felt like. I should be satisfied yet I miss something. Life seems awfully dull. Completely flat. It used to be stories and feelings, even if they were the heaviest darkest mud. Now I feel pleasantly indifferent. Laying in bed and watching the headlights of passing cars driving across the ceiling. I don’t have any story and I don’t have any place to go to, but I can’t even care about that."
46,"They said that crying would help, but I physically can't cry.","I've spent so long now feeling empty and broken. I've honestly wished sometimes to pass away in my sleep so there would at least be a tidy end to it all. I pretty much have nobody to talk to about anything that I'm feeling, and end up venting to this sloth plushie that I bought instead because no other living creature will just sit for a while and help keep me together. 
  
  
I saw somewhere online that just crying really hard will ease the pain, even if only for a bit, so I've been trying that for a while. It's been two hours, and I physically can't make myself cry. It's like my eyes have gone dry or something. Now I just feel worse because I could have spent that time sleeping or drowning myself in pills and YouTube videos instead of constantly thinking about everything and trying to force myself to tear up."
47,Her,"I dont sleep anymore
I rarely eat anymore 
I'm constantly depressed and for some reason scared 
Thinking of her makes me feel this way I cant tell if I'm in love because they say when a man loves a woman it's a wonderful feeling 

Can anyone relate to this this dreadful feeling I have inside of me"
48,Whiskey and beer,"Im sitting here, drinking whiskey and beer, watching the amazing world of gumball and just wanting to die. Merry Christmas reddit."
49,My therapist is on vacation and I miss her so much.,"I feel so alone and don’t see her until after the new year. I’m so attached to her, it’s the only place I feel safe or cared for. I miss her so much and just had to say that. 
She gave me a hug in our session and I would have stayed in there forever I’d she’d let me."
50,I feel guilty,"I don’t know how to change it: I feel guilty all the time. I look at the man the I love, the dogs that I adore, the future that I may build and... I keep wondering why all of that is not enough for me to be normal. 
I am not happy, I am not sad, I am nothing. My medications stopped working what seems like a life ago, my family doesn’t want me to increase the dosage, the last psychiatrist I had fell asleep while I was talking (and I couldn’t say anything: I just stopped going after that time). 
Writing used to make me feel better: I would write three or four pages before going to bed and I would feel cleansed out of all the negativity, but now I’m incapable of doing it. Putting one word after the other seems impossible. I read some stuff I wrote years ago and it was full of emotion and inspiration; now I’m just an empty shell and I feel a crushing sense of guilt because I am wasting everything.
I am wasting every skill I had, I am wasting the time of the people around me, I am wasting myself, I am wasting my life. 

English is not my main language, sorry if I wrote something awful."
51,Revelation,"Over the past few years every time I get into a really bad episode of depression I try to do some big spontaneous thing to remind myself that things aren’t always so bad and sometimes that works...for a few hours....and then I go back to normal life and back to how I was feeling before and I had the thought yesterday, after doing another spontaneous thing to bring me out of my depression, that this isn’t normal. I forget that normal people aren’t always this sad and exhausted and empty and in mental/emotional pain and yada yada.

At this point I’m fighting to find reasons to stay alive and I’m only 24 and one day I’m going to wake up and realize a hike to the top of a mountain to watch the sunrise/sunset doesn’t fill me with peace anymore and I’ll have nothing."
52,Girlfriend of 4 years left me due to my depression,"Completely alone. I just couldn't fix it and it was too much for her and now I've failed at something else.

I just want to sleep and not wake up"
53,Why does it seem like every person 25 and below has depression or anxiety? Its all they talk about.,
54,Friends not talking so might as well sleep.,"I feel so pathetic but if I'm not talking to the two people I usually talk to, I just end up sleeping.  I hate being that person who relies on others to keep them happy... But I am I suppose."
55,Finals leave me being done with life,"I am under an immense amount of stress with finals. I’m not even in college. I already got a c- on my algebra final which means my semester grade in the class will be a c. I took a chem test and likely bombed that too. I’m never gonna need these skills in life, and yet, they’ll be why I fucking end it."
56,Happy Birthday To Me,"I get to wonder if I will be able to remain friends with my best friend, if I should even bother thinking of a future with my boyfriend, and I should even bother trying to make my life better because it always comes back to me ruining everything."
57,I’m sad,
58,How to make friends in the loneliest city on Earth? Bonus: guess the city.,"20M, lived my entire life in one of the greatest but also most loneliest cities on earth. I've recently lost all my friends, and been spending everyday in bed or on my phone. I just want one soul to make human connection with but I'm not sure how to start or where to find them. I have hobbies but the people already have their own groups of friends, so it's hard for me to get in. Im pretty good at conversation despite the tragedy that is my life, but I just can't find someone to talk to. It's not really the culture to go up to strangers and make conversation. 

I feel so alone.

Please save me."
59,I can’t do this but I’m scared.,"I’ve tried killing myself before quite a few times, I’m an on and off cutter I have been since is was 13 I’m 20 years old now. My life has been nothing but misery it’s just one thing after another, I’ve been in hospital numerous times for this, I’m diabetic I’ve been bullied all my life by people I don’t know, school, my mother. I’ve been shunned and pushed away by everyone throughout my life, I constantly loose people, then when I try to kill myself im told I’m selfish. I don’t even know where I’m going with this or what I want to say I’m just a mess. I hate waking up. I hate myself. It hurts to live. But I’m scared to do it , what happens when I’m dead? The only people who truest care are my few friends and my brother. I don’t want to leave them. But the urge to slice my wrists open while I bleed out is overwhelming. Like is there someone controlling every aspect of my life? Watching? Making it worse everyday? Making people hate me? Was I born to be hated?! I tried.  I really did but. Once this shitty holiday is over I’m gone. At least I’m saving everyone’s Christmas from being shit eh??"
60,Why is it suicide,"Why can it be died of illness not suicide?
It would be better for my family because if someone asks them wheres your kid, died of sickness would be better then saying suicide."
61,Anybody else suffering from lucid nightmares?,
62,Sad and happy at the same time,"I dont know if this is the right place to post this, but my mood shifts quite often. I often keep a positive and happy look on the outside, and usually I am. But when I put all the distractions aside, or when I am completely by myself, i slowly shift into this depressed state of mind and think of all the negative things in my life. I don't like to talk about my feelings to anyone and every time I do, i get really embarrased and cringey afterwards.

At school I try to be as positive and happy as possible, but after I come home I shift into this grey empty vibe. But usually I cover it up with social media and games and going out with friends and going to the gym. But if i am completely alone with No phone, games or anything, i start thinking negative thoughts and degrading myself and thinking of everything wrong in my life.

And the times I am depressed, it is almost all because of me. I always question 'Why am I like this' 'why do I have to be the way I am'. I sometimes dont even know why im sad or depressed. I have plenty of friends, a nice family, doing OK in school etc. so I technically dont even have a reason to be sad. But for some reason i still do. 

But I wouldn't call it depressioon per se, its like a weekly shift. One week I am really energetic, happy and talk alot, even if im by my self. But on other weeks im quiet, think about life and am slighty depressed, no motivation and sometimes skip school. Usually I keep all my feeling bottles up and release them all at once. I am literally not good in anything, i would say I am very average skilled, but not good in anything particular. 

I just felt like writing this, im not that depressed, just bored and cant sleep right now. I think its just something about the darkness and bad weather my country is having."
63,Ugh I drank again,I went to a friend's and got too nervous so I drank for the first time in 80 days. Then I drank the next two days. I absolutely hate myself right now I've disappointed my family and I just keep pushing away my friends 💔 I'm so sorry everyone in my life ugh I'm so mad at myself
64,Have a lot of antidepressants,"Did anyone try commiting suicide with antidepressants? How did it feel? I feel like shit and to me it seems a pretty easy/good idea, I know it's not the best method but I live by myself and rarely visited"
66,I don’t know how hard I should be one myself,I know I have so much shit I have to work on. They say I should love myself but I know I have so many bad points to myself. All at the same time I do give myself a hard time and it hurts. It’s hard to continue when you know you have all this work you need to do. I also feel ashamed to feel good.
67,wheres your safe space space when you’re suicidal?,"where do you go when youre that depressed? ive driven away so many friends by relying on them to hang out with when im that sad, so i dont like to make friends my go-to. i moved so much in the past five years that nowhere feels like home. i just was wondering what other people do in this state of mind.
literally any input is appreciated please tell me about what you tend to do."
68,No one I know is okay,"Including me. I dont know why, but it seems like everyone I know's world is crumbling at once. I've got chronic neck pain, anxiety, and am looking for a job that won't be hell on my body. My dad has advanced cirrhosis. My mom is literally taking care of both of us sometimes. I feel like shit, but I'm trying to do everything I can do. Even if it's just washing the dishes or going out for milk. Just got back from hanging with my best friend. He's got something horribly wrong with him. Out of nowhere he started looking pale and asked me to feel his pulse. There were tears coming out of his eyes and his arm swelled up. I asked him if he wanted me to take him somewhere. He's been like this for a while now and can't afford healthcare. Everyone else I know is just either depressed or fucked in one way or another. I don't know when everything went wrong."
69,Feeling lost. Careers ideas for someone struggling with depression.,"What are some careers that would be bearable for someone with depression? I’m also a highly sensitive person and I feel so lost because it seems like every career comes with unimaginable stress that would be detrimental to my mental health. I’m willing to go to school for a 2 year degree but that’s about it, the debt load involved with a bachelors or anything higher would make me feel like I’m drowning even more than I already am. I don’t care much about money, but would like to make around $20/hour or $40,000 a year just so I can live a semi comfortable life. Ideally I’d love to work in the mental health field because I have a passion for helping people struggling with mental health issues but every career in this field requires so much school and debt for low pay. I literally don’t even care what the job is anymore as long as it’s something that isn’t super stressful and let’s me have time for myself outside of work. Also I can’t do freelance jobs or jobs that won’t offer health insurance. I have a medical condition and the medication is very expensive, it would be impossible not afford out of pocket and I’ll die if I go without it for more than a few days."
70,It's Hard To Be Strong All The Time,"I swear things will catch up to me eventually, I'm so tired"
71,I need help,"I’ve been dating this girl for almost 14 months now. She means the world to me. We had fights every so often, but we loved each other with all our hearts. Yesterday afternoon, she told me that it’s not working over text and that she needs space. She doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I don’t know what to do or how to deal with this. I’ve never felt so much pain in my life. I’m an 18 year old male and I’ve never felt this way about anybody in my life. She had me promise to never leave her, and I thought she needed me as much as I needed her. I’ve cried at least once every hour since 6 AM today and I can’t take it anymore. The pain I feel is unbearable. I saw her in the morning and I couldn’t help from hugging her tight and breaking down in tears. I miss her so much. I’ve never had a panic attack before today. I had uncontrollable spasms. I’d break down sobbing in the middle of class out of nowhere. On the drive home from school today, I almost took my own life. I’d been wailing for 15 minutes prior as I sat in my car, sobbing alone wishing for her to take me back.  A car in front of me stopped too soon and I ended up in a mild fender bender. I can’t take this pain anymore and I don’t know what I’m capable of. I just want to hold her in my arms like I used to and feel her head against my chest again. I didn’t want her to know about this, but I told her everything after contemplating it. She says she still cares about me, but not enough evidently. I wish things would go back to the way things were. I’d give anything for one more day with her."
72,What can a partner do to make things more... bearable?,"My spouse suffers from depression.  They’re on medication and good about taking them for the most part.  Most of the year, they’re doing okay...  

But about once a year, usually right around now(and is currently going on), they get hit pretty hard.  

Don’t want to do anything except lie in bed...  say some pretty hurtful things...  bad about keeping up with their medication.

As a non effected partner, I know I will never understand depression fully...  tbh, I just want my partner back on their feet and not feeling the horrible effects of depression.

I try to let some of the things they say roll off my back, but is there anything that can be done to make these periods easier on them?"
73,What to do when somebody depressed doesn’t want to improve?,"I know someone with depression as they do nothing to fight it. They’re taking medication but that’s it. They sulk in bed all day everyday and it’s been going on for over a year now.

Any psychiatrist help to improve such as getting up to do activities, etc. they do nothing. They don’t want to go out and be with family, not even to help her mom with her night job (who’s sister just passed away).

Just does nothing to improve or want to improve at all. They said they don’t want to get better. 

What do I do???"
74,I'm fed up of always being the friend that cancels. Just so stuck in my depression with no one to talk to but too terrified to open up to anyone.,
75,Im not sure if i have depression or bipolar disorder,"Ive recently been having quite extreme mood changes, ie crying in my school bathroom for apparently no reason and genuinely thinking about cutting, and im super scared. I sometimes feel like that but other times i feel super happy. A couple times ive also felt kind of 'high'. Its hard to explain but i felt EXTREMELY happy and kind of like i was going crazy. It was super wierd and ive never felt anything like it. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, a fifteen yo guy."
76,I wanna throw up,Do you ever feel physically ill from feeling like shit? Because I do! :)
77,Snowday Suicide,"I've decided to hang myself in the mountains next time it snows. I've managed to save up enough money to pay for my body to be cremated, and I think it's about that time. I've never really been happy, I cant stop thinking about wanting to kill and eat women, and life is completely pointless and not worth living. Fuck the human race, fuck the planet, and fuck everyone who reads this. Bye! 😈"
78,Today I saw star wars with my friend (no spoiler),"And is the first time i saw somone that isn't my family in like 3 week
He came with his brother and his girlfriend
The movie was ok, but the more i stayed with them the more i feeled like nothing
This because i want that, that genuinely happy mood without constant fear, anxiety, rejection of myself ecc in mind
I just wanted to be normal, but then I realized I will never be


I think in pushing away the last persons who are my friend, even if I feel like they deserve better than me"

81,Lapse of depression while in welbutrin,"Hey. Had a pretty bad month or two as far as external things. I am on 200mg welbutrin. My bad feelings are coming back and everything feels meaningless again. I am so irritable and sad I just want it to stop. Welbutrin was working really well for a few months, has anyone had a lapse of depression to have the welbutrin start working again. ALSO I am taking buspar as well. Maybe that is effecting me? I cant talk to a doctor until after January."
82,"I feel weak overall, physically and emotionally",I don’t know how the fuck am I supposed to help myself
83,I Think It's Time to Call It. I'm Ready to Die,"* Can't find a job
* Business Failed
* Car Repossessed
* Account Negative
* Credit Cards Maxed
* Over 40 living at parent's house now. 

Every single problem in my life is money related and I repel money. 

I'm over it... It's time to kill myself. I don't want another day in this miserable existence."
84,Jobs &amp; Experience,"Sorry. Just felt like venting here. I hate that it seems as though everyone around me can work hard and get great jobs, and some even don't work that hard and get things handed to them. I've put my blood, sweat and tears into the training and school necessary for my job, and I've applied, done all of the necessary bullshit for perfecting all my materials (resume, cover letter, etc.), am offering to work any shift, willing to negotiate pay, etc. And I get turned down. I understand that there are people with more experience and more appealing qualities. But it's so frustrating working hard for something and being shot down. For certain positons, I understand there are certain things they're looking for and they want a certain level of experience. But why is it when it's an entry level position, you won't give someone the chance to gain experience? How am I supposed to obtain a certain level of experience if no one is going to give me a chance? I don't mean to sound like I'm having a pity party, but I'm tired of barely making ends meet, working jobs where I'm unhappy, working hard for things and not being able to be successful with it."
85,Christmas is ruined,"My girlfriend of 2 and a half years told me she has feelings for her coworker and is leaving me because she wants to pursue a relationship with her. She outlined all the things about me that she hated that contributed to the breakup. But we were talking about getting married and having a family just the other week, calling each other the love of our lives and it felt so real. She was my rock that I could rely on no matter what. I got cheated on in my last relationship which ruined me for years. Now I'm just thinking about all the signs that she was doing stuff behind my back. I'm all alone, drinking myself to death while she's probably out with her new love enjoying the holidays together, over me before I even knew it was ending. We haven't contacted each other since but I so badly want to beg, i miss her so much. I just feel so worthless and no good at all. I hate myself. I agree with her about all the things she hates about me. I feel so betrayed. And I feel like I deserve to feel this way. I always had high anxiety and was depressed before but this pain is just so intense. I thought about killing myself for the first time in 5 years since nearly flunking out of college. I've been tossing the idea around in my head all day for the last 3 days trying to think about the best way to do it. Is it weird that I dont want to be happy again or get better? A close friend tried to cheer me up with the usual ""plenty of women out there, you deserve better, give it time"" but I dont believe it. I want to never wake up and disappear forever instead. How can I get better? I feel like i can't fix who i am no matter how hard I try and that self hate has become insurmountable."
86,One Last Chance,"I don't want to bore you with a pointless story. The important part is to that I'm 24 and unemployed. I have a bachelor's degree in English/Creative Writing, which was my first mistake. I can't find a job no matter how hard I try or how many applications I send out. I still live at home and I'll soon be losing my insurance. 

In February I'm going to start horology (watchmaking) school. If I still can't find a job after all that, I plan on killing myself. I don't like living anyway, and life is pointless without a job to pay for necessities. 

So yeah. This is my last chance or else I'll be dead at 26."
88,Help.,I feel so alone. I’ve been depressed since 7th grade and I’m at my senior year. I have had a girlfriend for a year and it’s hard to love her at the end of the day because my depression takes a lot out of me. I’m still doing good in school but I can’t stop thinking about death.
89,any advice ?,give me any advice love of 7 years is just waste and i dont feel its love anymore he is keep ignore me and never ask about me i feel so mad that he is does not likes me i have did everything impossible with him even the forbidden too and then suddenly he is just stop that he is only do it for his benefit and i was too stupid to believe anything he said to me he was using me after get anything what he want from me
90,i crave the feeling of true happiness,i just want to feel good again. i'm sick of all of this and feeling sick of it. i'm happy to have support but i want the cloud to just go away and i feel selfish for saying that. school is putting the biggest burden on me as ever before but i just can't keep up with all of it.
91,The role of families in depression,I feel extremely selfish and ungrateful because so many people with depression do not come from a stable and healthy family environment. I happen to have a very normal unbroken family that I potentially go to for help I guess? But I never ever felt like I fit in with my family and the thought of going to them for any sort of help or venting has never seemed to be an option for me. Then I read about people who don’t even have parents or a family and it makes me feel like the biggest ungrateful piece of shit ever and hate myself even more. Idk.
92,"Does anyone else feel like they don't want to live, but also don't want to die either?","I feel like that every time I get an emotional depression 'attack', where I uncontrollably cry because of how I feel about myself and/or the situation that I am in. I am imagining ways of how I would kill myself, seeing vivid images in my head of how I hang myself with a belt in a wardrobe or lie after overdosing on a bunch of pills. And somehow it makes me cry even more because brighter days that I do get make me want to be alive. I can't talk to anyone about that, as I have pretty much isolated myself from my few friends that I had, and my boyfriend doesn't understand my mental health issues. I am exhausted of feeling this way, of battling depression and body dysmorphia for so long. It just feels like it will never end."
93,Third episode. Need help.,"I had a depressive episode back in 2008, it was untreated and took 6 months to clear. Then another in 2012 and I took 60 mg Cymbalta, it seemed to clear up in about 6 weeks. Took longer to feel more normal, but was functional. I was lucky to tolerate the Cymbalta well.

And I'd been fine since then. Was encouraged by my doc to stay on Cymbalta at that dose since it seemed to help with my baseline anxiety. 

This weekend I felt my mind spiral out of control. It all happened so fast and now I'm barely eating, waking up way too early, and just feel this horrible feeling like my brain is gasping for air and not getting any. 

I've cut out all alcohol, sought some help with family, and am trying to get some exercise each day. Doc said I can stick with that, up my Cymbalta to 90 mg, or add in Lexapro. I don't know what to do. I hate feeling this way and I dread the mornings. Will I ever feel better?"
94,Feel like I am losing myself,"Title might sound dramatic but I have struggled with depressive thoughts and suicidal thoughts when I was 15-17. It got better for a while and then I met a guy I’ve been on and off with for a while. Took the first breakup really hard and realized I still had some issues with myself. (This was more than 1 year ago) This summer we had some struggles but I still had a great summer and then I started going to a great school in August to study what I love and see myself doing in the future. But recently (come winter) I’ve been struggling mentally. I’ve been really anxious but most of all I am tired all the time. I live in a place where we barely see daylight. I feel less and less motivated to get up in the morning even if I get to do what I love when I get to school. I’ve been feeling like nothing matters, I don’t enjoy things as much and I just feel empty. I usually love being alone and doing random things but now nothing feels fulfilling. Been partying more than usual also recently which also worries me. I don’t want to fall into substance abuse...

Please help"
95,An ear if you need one,I know that at this time of year it can be hard to navigate the murky puddle of depression and anxiety even more so. So I’m extending a shoulder to lean on and an ear to listen. I don’t judge. I’ve been in dark places and still deal with depression to this day. I can give advice or you can just vent to someone impartial. Feel free to DM me. Peace and love to all
97,I can't feel anything,"I don't know how long it's been going on, but it's been going on for a while. It feels like my emotions have been plugged up, it's a bit hard to explain. Even when I'm sad -- I can feel myself crying and maybe some pain in my chest, but nothing besides that. When I'm laughing I feel nothing. It's just a constant state of nothing. It's almost like wearing noise-canceling headphones. I know that I should be feeling a certain way in situations (e.g. happy on my birthday), so I think I try to act like I feel that way, but in reality, I feel nothing. It feels like I've lost something very important inside me. Sometimes I keep asking myself what happened to make me feel this way, and where I lost the ""something"" that is so important to me. I guess it could have been the fact that my family physically abused me for years. I do not have any love for them, and they're no closer to me than strangers. I think that something about having such a messed up childhood might have messed me up as well. I keep losing friends, or more like pushing them away. I constantly feel like they don't care about me while I care about them too much, and I end up trying to cut them off. I also lost my best friend recently. He abruptly cut off all contact with me, and I heard from his brother a year later that he just wanted to ""move on"" after moving to a new city. I only have one truly close friend nowadays, but another friend (close but not as close) is jealous of me and his relationship and that's also messing with me a bit. Right now I feel like I have nothing. I have no close personal connection that doesn't have a major issue with it. I feel that I'm basically alone in this world, and whenever I feel lonely, I realize that I don't have anybody that I want to talk to. I have nobody. My friends either left me or I pushed them away. My family is only a family by name. 

I keep wondering where my emotions went. It's like I lost my ""heart"". Sometimes it makes me feel like I would rather be dead. Even with my friends (even with the closest ones), I don't feel anything when I'm with them or when I talk to them. When I express my affection towards them, it's like I'm acting in a movie. It makes sense that I should do it, but I don't really feel anything about it. I hope that I won't feel this way forever, because it makes me feel like I'm as good as dead."
98,I feel so trapped,"Recently, things have been spiraling so far downwards in my life. About a month ago I was hospitalized and started to get a little bit better afterwards, but we all know that hospitals won’t fix everything. I started to relapse, I have issues with hurting myself and have not been able to control my urges. After my parents found out about this relapse, they went batshit. I can no longer drive by myself, I cannot go out to see my friends or my boyfriend, I am expected to have someone come to the bathroom with me or stand outside, I can’t have basic things like wall tacs or a lighter for candles. They don’t seem to get that they are not helping me. They are only making things so very much worse for me. I want to escape so badly but I have no control over most things because I am a minor. I feel so trapped and out of control, it is hard to work on getting better when most everything that makes me happy has been taken away. I miss my boyfriend and my friends.

If you have any advice I am all ears,
Thank you"
99,Face masks,"Like I know its stupid. But if you want glowing skin( idk but all you but my skin looks dull from being indoors all the time) I tried this dipeptide sheet face mask and it's made my skin so nice. It's a small thing, but it makes a big difference for me haha."
100,Anyone here cognitively associate their bed with wakefulness and depression?,I realize that the times where I am most depressed and awake are when im lying in my bed.
101,i no longer have a cat,"just a few minutes ago my dad started driving off to give our cat back.
we’ve had him for 2-3 years and he had been peeing on stuff. he had peed on our couch so much that we had to throw the couch away. he had stopped for at least a months but yesterday he had peed on our recliner. i’m fucking devastated. i don’t know how i’ll handle being without him. i’ll wonder every fucking day how he is, is he ok, is he even alive?? is he as sad as i am not being able to see us. is the owner loving and caring?? i’ll wake up every day, come out of my room and except to see my cat. i’ll wonder where he is. it’ll take a few seconds to remember he’s gone and 

i just can’t take it them house will feel emptier. i fucking loved our cat.  i didn’t even get to see him for the last time before my dad left with him. will my cat even know he’s not coming back? will he wonder ‘when will i go back to my family? how long will i stay with this random person’?’ 
i just can’t fucking take this"
102,I just need to vent!,"English isn't my first language so sorry in advance.
I haven't read anything in this sub except the description  and decided to try and write some of what I am going through.
I haven't left my bed in two weeks I can't eat or get myself to do anything .
I've pushed all my friends away because I just can't handle any social interaction right now.
I am the type of girl who is always in a relationship but for the last year I've been single letting random guys take advantage of my loneliness and I would give any thing to have someone be in love with me even though I know I am not worth it I will never be good enough no matter how hard I try.
and the thing is I don't even think I am capable of love anymore it's like there is a stone where my heart used to be . I just have no passion towards anything .
I used to write and I have too many stories and ideas that I just can't put into paper.
I am a last year medical student and I hate what I am studying I can't  get myself to study god only knows how I passed all these years. my birthday is in two days and I can't stop crying I feel old and like I wasted all of my good years studying something I hate and being depressed I have no one to celebrate my birthday with and I don't think any one will even remember . every breath I take is painful and I just wanna end this but I am too scared ."
103,"For some big, for me nothing","I read that people here get really uplifted just by doing a small chore, like brushing their teeth, cleaning their room. It makes me haply for them, since I did that everyday but it still doesn't make me the man I want to be. No meds, no activities that could help. Is it possible that some people are just meant for suicide? That some people really can't exist without the clouds of depression? Lots of things I missed out in life, that people enjoy or die to be part of it. I just let them be and nothing happened."
104,boyfriend problem,i love this guy for 7 years and i miss him alot but he ignore me all the time i keep send him messages every day morning and after noon and evening and he get 1000 messages from me in the day cus i miss him alot and im only send angry messages i feel i miss him alot but always ignore me after he get what he want from me i dont think he ever loved i feel like im blind in love with him and i feel stuck the guy is never busy but always using me and using me again and again i have talk about him in my other posts i see him online all time he even left the group app im sure he dm other girls he likes girls maybe im just nothing to him and he never loved me and i feel stuck and cant leave him i dunno what to do about it
105,I’m confused,"In late elementary and early middle school I had some pretty bad depression/ anxiety that changed me at the time. I’m now a sophomore and haven’t had any mental problems since recently. Through the past year I’ve lost one of my best friend groups and faded with my other ones. The girls I’ve talked to have slowly drifted away. At most times I just feel empty and emotionless but I never think about suicide. I just feel that life has lost its charm. At school I act normal for people but when I get home and I’m alone I don’t. I just feel empty and emotionless. I never get excited or happy for things. The only thing I truly enjoy is music. It gives me time to reflect. I look back on past experiences and just feel empty. I hate when I don’t have school because I’m just alone and bored most of the time. And when I’m at school I get anxious some times which really has affected my social life. I just want to feel appreciated or loved by someone other than my family. I truly don’t know if I’m depressed or just going through a low point in my life. I don’t think anyone truly knows how I feel not even my parents. I just pass it off as I’m tired or worn out.  I don’t know why I’m posting here. I just kind of wanted to try it out and vent a bit. Maybe even get some responses.
(This is also my first time posting sorry for anything wrong)"
106,Ballroom dancing,"Thinking about starting again. It's never too late right? Haha. I would prefer to be skinnier before I start but like oh well. Became a bit more chubby than normal because of overeating but I'm losing it. I love dancing so much, I've missed it a lot. Idk if anyone feels the same about wanting to start an old hobby again... idk like may as well go for it? 😊👍"
107,I haven’t been able to take a shower on the first try in a month,"Every time I take a shower I just end up lying down, and wasting water. So I have to get out dry off, and psych myself up to have the motivation to wash myself. I usually get it done by the 2nd or 3rd time. I just realized today how depressing that is"
108,why me,"I’ve gotten to the point whwre it really takes my energy away, physically &amp; mentally..

I can’t even dress right anymore..I look like a slob.."
109,Psychiatrist and weed,I have ADHD and depression (obviously) and I wanted to schedule an appointment with my mother's psychiatrist but she said they do pee tests every time which I'm okay with but I smoke weed and she said it's a no-no there. I was wondering if there's a rule or something against weed and wanting to take medication like such in Indiana. I know weed is still illegal and all but there's no way or is there hope? I want help but damn I love weed and I see no effects on me other than making me feel good.
110,I hate how I look,"I always thought I looked pretty okay in the mirror. you know, average, nothing remarkable, but not ugly either. But I always look so assymmetrical and ugly in photos and videos. People look at me weird when they talk to me, no one ever approached me in social settings, and I always noticed my coworkers look at me like I look like a gollum.

Well, today I found out that you think you look good in the mirror because you've gotten used to your face, bc you look at it every day all your life. The trick is to bend your head sideways, kinda like rotating a portrait 90 degrees. Your brain isn't registered to this, so you'll see what you look like to strangers.

I did it this morning, and almost cried at what I saw. My 2 sides of the face are really assymmetrical. One side is round and the other side is angular. I have visible Cruella-like cheekbones on one side of my face only. My lips and jaw are misaligned to one side. My 2 front teeth are crooked, and I have a slight underbite(which, with my flat nose, makes my face look punched in) My face also looks long and my chin huge due to my underbite

I remember I went to the dentist earlier this year, and she offered to write me a referral for a facial reconstruction surgery for my underbite bc my chin sticks out and my lower lips slightly juts out. At the time I am aware of my lower jaw, but I never thought it was that big of a deal. I couldn't afford the surgery cost, anyways.

My face looks so ugly and alien. I was sickly as a baby and toddler, and my mom trusted a lot of quack doctors with sketchy licenses, so I took a lot of weird meds(we liked in China back then; during the 90s medical regulations were shit there. They would literally sell snake oil in hospitals.) I wouldn't be surprised if she took some while pregnant with me. 

Now I know why its so hard for me to make friends when I approach people. :("
111,I don’t know if I’m really depressed,"I’m a SAHM to 5 kids, married ten years. I don’t have any money, we are paycheck to paycheck. 

My husband can take care of the kids, get help, cook, clean, etc with out me if he had to. He could get another wife if he wanted to. 

My kids are just kids, they don’t appreciate anything I do. Husband just wants a clean home and food. He doesn’t care what I do, he doesn’t care if I want to go out or plan things. He just wants to work and play and do what the fuck ever he wants.

I don’t have any friends. I don’t know how to make them, I’ve been to mom groups and tried to meet up and talk and exchange numbers or what the fuck ever and I get ghosted. Wtf is the fucking point if I’m just going to be ignored?

My family fucking sucks and I don’t talk to them anymore, for years. My in laws suck too. They are always “busy” except for holidays and birthdays, no real relationship there. I’m just gatekeeper to the kids. If we never had kids they’d never bother to talk to me.

If I let the house go, they slowly pitch in a little and husband will figure out food. I’m not necessary. I’m apparently not good enough to be friends with. I’m bored nd lonely and I wonder if life is even worth living. The kids will grow up and I’ll be left with a lukewarm husband who can’t even fucking bother to plan a date night for aTen FICKINFG YEARS of marriage. It’s all just one long fucking date. This whole relationship was built out of convenience. I’ve got no skills, no one likes me except for food or a fuck.

What the fuck."
112,I don't know what is wrong with me,"This is a throwaway account.

I'm a 26 year old male. I can't see a single reason to continue living. I don't enjoy anything. I don't want anything. I have no short or long term goals. I hate my job. I'm not sure if it's the job or just my attitude. I'm a software developer. I am somehow a perfectionist and also so much farther from perfection than everyone else I meet. I feel obligated to keep myself alive. I feel obligated to be independent. I'm divorced. I am becoming increasingly irritable. I keep finding reasons to dislike my friends. I hate every else's flaws just as much as I hate my own, maybe more. 

My friends and family think I'm nice. They think I'm fair. They think I'm successful. My boss thinks I'm smart. He thinks I have potential. I can't take the compliments. I don't believe them. It just makes me respect the person complimenting me less.

I feel tired. I feel overwhelmed. I want everything to be less. I want the sun to be less bright. I want the world to make less noise. I want people to stop talking to me. I want my dog to stop barking. I want a job that doesn't expect anything from me. I feel like I must just be lazy. If life really requires as much hard work and patience as it seems, then count me out. I think the only shred of hope that I have is that it isn't that hard. That I'm just in the wrong place. What if I apply to a different job? What if it feels the same?  What if there is something out there that doesn't drain me? I'm afraid to try, because I expect to melt down completely if I fail.

I'm terrified of making decisions. I've been wanting to write this post for years. I find myself beating my head against the wall (sometimes literally) trying to make myself take action. I can't make doctor's appointment's for myself.

Am I just broken? Why do I constantly crave LESS from everything."
113,I feel so hopeless,"I dont really know where to vent or with whom to speak about this anymore. Ive got bearly any friends and the ones i got either say stuff like ""your not depressed... And make up som bullshit.. Etc..."" or just dont care and dont want to listen. Even my parents show no support or even belief that im actually depressed. 

My last three years were hell, got forced to go ti a high school i didnt want to, forced to learn what i dont want to and to top it all off i have 0 friends in the school,my anxiety doesnt help it, everyone i meet i feel like is predisposed to hate me before even seeing me. And the only persone i truly cared about and liked in this world just broke me into a million pieces that will never all get back together. 

I dont know what else to do, ive tried a million things, games hobbies just to get my mind off of everyting but i dont enjoy anything anymore not even what i used to like before, i mostly spend my days laying in bed and crying unless someone gets me outside. My depression has peaks and lows in severity and it just happend now that im the most depressed ive ever been and got actually heartbroken at the same time. And ive felt heartbreak or being betrayed by close people before but never like this, this is the first time i actually loved someone and now its like ill never love again it hurt too much.  Ive tried killing myself and failed and i asked myself everyday for the last two years ""why did i live if most things are even worse now"" my only coping mechanism was weed and it doesnt even help anymore. I feel like i wont last until 2020. The saddest part is that ive always had it easy in life. Upper middle class familiy, mostly always got what i wanted, top of my class.. Nothing to complain about in terms of material ""wealth"" , yet im here complaining because im not happy. And i would trade everything just to be happy and loved. But I cant be. I dont know why or what i did to deserve this. I dont deserve to live

Im sorry to whoever reads this didnt want to bother you, i dont know anymore where to vent or who to talk to. I suppose this is my last cry for help before killing myself or bottleing everything inside and becoming numb, not bothering to feel again..."
114,hi - i am not in a horrible life situation,"yes, you read that right. i am not sad. i am not anxious. i do not fear life and its challenges. i do not think people loathe me and/or avoid me. i dont think im a burden to my family. i do have a social life. i am doing solidly in school, with slipping grades here and there due to various factors that are none of the above.

and yet i want to kill myself.

now now, before you start hating - hear me out.

a person doesnt have to lead a miserable life to be in such a state of mind not to want to live one at all. my life is okay and i should be thankful for what i have.

most of yalls lives are probably solid too. 

you have food on the table every day. you can walk outside every day. you can drink fresh water everyday. you can sleep every day. you walk around and you see people, you interact with at least a mildly rude cashier or am elderly cleaning lady. your grades are not the worst / you have a job that pays (even if barely). 

and yet that doesnt stop you from feeling as if you just domt want to ""be"".

for any of you who cam relate:

its okay.

your suicidal thoughts and ideas are just as valid as those of the individuals who (seemingly nor legitimately) have it much worse. you might not be suffering from the stereotypical pains of suicidal people but you are no less important than they are. your pain is still real pain. the fact that youre not actually okay is important.

stay safe"
116,Extremely bored of living..,I wish I could sleep forever. Sleep is gooood.
117,"My deppresion is ""back"".",I had lot of mental problems or atleast i always let myself believe in it. I tried to escape from my old life and i kind of succeded and this was feeling really good last month but the screaming in my head what i was trying to Escape from is getting back. Its getting stronger day after day and few minutes ago i almost didnt handle it. I feel lost. I dont know why i cant just continue in being happy. Fuck i have no one to talk in the house full of people from All around the world but still there noone who would understand me. Sorry for my shitty post. I just need someone to hold my hand i just need someone to care about me i just need someone who would understand. Becouse i dont know what else is going to stop that screaming in my head.
118,I feel attacked,"Today I went to see my doctor, because of chest pain. He told me to take off my shirt.. so I did. My arm is full of selfharm scars and he knew about me doing sh.. so I wasnt really worried about him seeing them. Suddenly he grabed both my hands, stretched my arms and inspected them. He said: ""looks like you have mutilated yourself a bit to much, huh?"" He told me it was scarring (like.. I know, lol) and he let go of my arms to take a look at my chest. He said the pain wasnt caused by a physical problem, but was most likely caused by my anxiety. 

I thought I was free to leave now.. but he wanted to talk after that. I told him about me failing school because of my terrible mental state at the time and he just said: ""so.. you did it yourself, failing school."" I was so confused by this.. like.. yeah I kinda did, but also it was caused by serious mental health issues, which I am getting treatment for at the moment. After that he said: ""you don't like attention, do you?"" I told him no, because I really don't like to be in the spotlights.. Im introverted. He responded: ""but if you cut yourself you will get attention."" 

Normally he is really kind and funny.. but this just left me speechless. I began asking myself.. am I faking my mental illness? Is this something I should be able to go through without issues and am I just a weak, lazy person? 

Obviously thats not the cause. My mental issues have been (and sometimes still are) pretty severe. But this kind of situations always make me doubt myself :/"
119,“Get off the couch”,"“Just move your legs you piece of shit.”

“Just get up, literally move your body a few feet.”

“Do anything,” I tell myself.

And yet it’s like my body won’t obey me.

“You stupid piece of shit.”"
121,Does anyone else have no personality?,"I have no personality.  It's especially worse when I am alone.  I sit around with no energy or no clue what to do with myself.  When I am around others I absorb their personality and become them.  Essentially i have ""guidance"" who to be.  Unfortunately when I am depressed a long period of time people want nothing to do with me which makes my lack of personality even more alarming."
123,"Feeling depressed, alone and disliked. It's a struggle to get out of bed in the morning.","I've always been introverted, and there have been times where I feel so isolated and alone that I question if I am invisible. of course this leads to me feeling depressed.  Lately I've been feeling this way again. my boss allows us to work remotely once per week but my peers gossip and judge you if you do and they ""notice"" who isn't there. so I stopped doing it (even though I'm entitled to) but when I'm at work I feel ignored and alone. my coworkers are somewhat competitive and gossipy.  but they also socialize and chat with one another. they'll literally go into my neighbor's office and not even say hello to me, like I'm not even there. they'll have outside of work get togethers, and discuss them in front of me, even though I wasn't invited and I have no idea what they are talking about. sometimes they don't intentionally not include me - they simply FORGOT I EXIST.  when we go to lunch, sometimes if I say something, and try to contribute, they look at me like I'm weird. this makes me feel rejected.
I guess to sum it up, I feel socially rejected. 
I literally got on the elevator with a coworker who is invited to my upcoming wedding. he didn't speak to me and practically ran out of the elevator and couldn't get away from me fast enough. (what happened to ""ladies first""?).  not helping with me feeling like crap. 
now I feel embarrassed that I invited him(well, sent the save the dates..)
I don't know if it's temporary or what but every day I wish I could just not go to work
other times these people are competitive. one coworker even looks up everyone's ""stats"" to size everybody up and see how they are performing. she was complaining about one guy who apparently wasn't producing enough in her opinion. She is also the type who is overly loud and involves herself in everything (frankly I actually dont know how she has time for it all, I barely have enough time to get just my own work done), but she's also competitive in the sense that for instance I am vegan and someone asked me why, and one thing I said was because I love animals. Even though this conversation wasn't about her, she interjected, in a defensive tone, ""I love animals TOO"" and also saying how she was vegan once too. like as if me being vegan says something about her?!
I just feel like these people don't even like me.  And because I've been busy lately I haven't seen the other people outside of work in forever and they stopped inviting me too (because I had to decline so often). whenever I say something in the group chat nobody response.  
Yes I'm ""that"" person. The loser of the group that when you say something everyone looks at each other, like you are a weirdo. 
I'd like to think more highly of myself, and I dont personally THINK I'm a terrible, weird person, but when the world around me acts like I am, it's hard not to be depressed

any advice?"
124,2019 was the worst year of my life and will be the last,Thing will not getter better and there's no need to pretend they will. Apparently I'm not worthy of living a joyful life
125,Motivation to practice yoga,"Hi everyone! I've been struggling with motivation to practice yoga for almost a year now. Ya know, depression has me on house lock. I have a free membership to a nice studio and I just cat get my a** off of my couch. I seriously feel like my mind holds me hostage. I enjoy yoga and everytime I do get up and off the couch I feel SO GOOD after a class. I'm not sure if anyone has a cure or any advice but I'd love to hear it!

Thankyou &lt;3"
126,I feel nothing,I have no sympathy for anything or anyone I feel cold and shut off to everything my friends thank I’m just being an ass hole but honestly I just don’t care anymore about anything I feel no joy in life just nothing emptiness
127,Redraw,"I asked someone why I might be hated
They said because of how I come off
How I talk
The way I am
I want to erase myself 
Slowly but surely I'll end
No one wants me"
128,All I want For Christmas is being loved,please
129,Why do I feel like everyone secretly strongly dislikes me?,"No matter how good a conversation goes, I always end up so depressed and crying because I feel like everyone has a real deep hatred towards me. Especially if I did something ‘embarrassing’...

Any advice?"
130,Im confident in saying I'll kill myself whenever i find that chance,"Im 21 and my mother had enough of me hiding in my room not making money. So she kicked me to france, to my dad whom i never seen except once in my life.  I never wanted to go but my mum has been saying for ages that i should go to france since i aint doing shit. And then my dad also adding in that i should come. Theyll be jobs for me blah blah. I just accepted my fate. I felt stuck in the uk and wow would u look at that im stuck in france. And i cant even go back since i got no money to travel there. Let alone to get my own place. Wow.

I decided to go out today for a walk. Heard it helps the mind and stuff. Ended up staying out for 5 hours trying to look for a cliff or a something to jump off on or thinking about packing up and just walk away till i eventually fall ill and break. 
I see no reason on why i shouldnt kill myself. I cant kill the thing thats making me feel this way because its the fact that im not comfortably rich. I dont even have a dream or a unknown talent. Not even a social person to hold a connection with anyone. 
And u know the people who say to not give up and stuff. It falls on deaf ears, words of encouragement isnt gonna to help me.
 I dont even want money thats the crazy part. And i know this cause the few times i made money i would always feel like giving it away to someone else. 
The way i see my life, ive been losing since i was 9-10yr. And really my existance as a human is just to breed so humanity can still exist. Anythin else is just to pad the time of our death. 

I seriously tried to give myself a reason to care about my own life. About my future. To give myself hope (so i can end up in despair again) like for example the fact that i was givin birth. I never gave consent to it so why do i have to be thankful for that from where im sitting i would have been content if it didnt happen and then my birth doesnt exactly matter if im not making money. Making myself useful.
The other reason would be my friends would be sad, yeah i only have online friends from different country and i would miss them, wish i could have met them but i cant. That reason alone isnt enough to stop me from doing it anymore
 The last reason that always stopped me was that i hate pain but now its a bullet im willing to take
So no i havent found a good enough reason that makes me say ""id rather be in my losing life instead of having my eternal rest.
Im already a lazy cunt who wishes to have things go my way. And truthfully i kinda like myself so i never had plans to change that behaviour even tho i know that would be my downfall. I still place some blame on society

This was long and i just wanted to say all this"
132,I fucked up.,"I was taking a college biology class online for dual credit, and thought was doing pretty good. Until halfway through the semester, i learned the other half was on another website. I finished the last half with goddamn flying colors. But all of the first half I missed cause my grade to plummet from an 86 to a fucking 42.129. And I have no one else to blame except me. I fucking hate myself."
133,why does everyone leave me,"every time i open up to someone they leave. i’m always being walked all over because i sacrifice my happiness for everyone else’s. i feel useless and worthless, like i don’t matter and i’m not worthy of feeling bad about things that happen to me. like everyone is above me and i’m just a stepladder they use so make themselves feel better. i can’t open up to people now because of past events and now the one time i do they leave me behind like everyone else. what am i doing wrong? why am i always the only one getting hurt? i don’t want to do this anymore. people walk all over me and use me and then when i tell them i’m worthless and only useful when i’m being used they tell me that they “care” about me and “i shouldn’t kill myself”. i’m sick of everyone turning their back on me the moment i make a mistake or they realize they can’t fix me. when they do something wrong they forgive themselves right away. it’s not fair that they can live freely while i’m trapped in a cage. but sure, they “care” about me. but continue to hurt me and backstab me. i feel like i’m just dragging myself around at this point, like the only thing keeping me alive is my body. i feel like i died a long time ago. i’m just hurling around a corpse."
134,Social media,"I don’t know if it’s just me, but does it make your mood worse? Like seeing everyone all happy and shit and you’re just at home doing nothing"
135,Fuck it. I’m done stalling,"I’ve put it off long enough. I’ve wanted to die for 3 years but I’ve always told myself it’ll get better. Well now I know that it doesn’t. It just doesn’t. I’ve already sent the suicide note to the only person I ever told I wanted to die. So tonight, after everyone is asleep, I’m going to go upstairs and down every pill I can find till I drop dead."
136,Having a depressive episode is a lot like being sick with a cold or something,I’m currently going through one and I feel physically weak and exhausted and like all I can do is sleep. Even that won’t make me feel better but it buys time where I don’t have to think about what’s bothering me.
137,Therapy has mad my depression worse?,"Has therapy made me worse. I mean I just started going like 1 month ago, but I feel so much WORSE now. And i only go every two weeks becuase my copay is hella expensive.. part of me just wants to stop going. Maybe it's a waste of money"
138,I’m feeling suicidal,"(20F) I wanna end my life, I’m filling up the bathtub because I wanna try to drown myself, it’s like the only option I have to kill myself, it’s too much, too much pain, I wanna end it."
139,How do I help someone with depression,"I know it’s hard to really help people because I’m not an expert. My (online) best friend is depressed and I want to do everything I can to help him. He says I can’t, but I feel like just being there for him isn’t enough. It kills me inside to see him like this and I want to do everything in my power to help him. Please give advice, he’s the most important person in my life and it kills me to think that I might one day lose him to this."
140,I don’t leave my bed,Apart from going to work I never leave my bed. I even eat all my meals in my bed. I often think I’ll go on my pc and play games but the motivation isn’t there and hours go past and I’m still just in my bed with YouTube on in the background. I have no passion no motivation to get up and do anything. I don’t have any friends so not motivation to go out. I feel so lonely and just kind of hope that I’ll wake up one day and I’ll have a great group of friends and have a closer family life. Although I’m in a relationship I see him once a week and go straight back to this motivation-less state. How the hell do I bring myself back up ? Fuel the fire again? Find passion ? Anything
141,I'm not able to live my life.,"Before anyone says it I have thought about leaving but I'm not sure if this madness will follow me.

For the last six years, My father's ex-wife and her son(and his gangbanger friends) have been trying to kill my father my stepmother me and my three siblings.

I don't know the full context of why my dad's ex-wife is doing this she is crazy that's all I know but basically because of her and her son I have lost half of my 20s.

We basically ended up homeless because every time we called the cops nothing was done and it was not safe to stay at our home.

We tried to get help from family members but nobody wanted to help out or even believe what has been going on.

Add to that and we had to run all over the place just to get away from them the last two years have been calm but still an absolute hell.

We have been in crappy motel to crappy motel and my life has been miserable nobody believes us and for some reason, they want to parade their happy lives in front of us.

We currently have a bedbug infestation. 

Life is moving on and I feel like I'm in prison ill be honest I have thought about ending my life because it's clear that it won't stop and I hate my dad for getting me stuck in this nightmare.

Every time I bring it up he gets mad I just want to yell at him and tell him its all his fault that we are stuck in this mess.

What would you do if you were in the hell that is my life?"
142,"I think a woman is interested in me, but i don't know if i am ready for a relationship...","We are 21 years old.

I have known her for 1 year. We have never met irl because she lives in a different state, but i played video games with her and her ex bf(my old friend who introduced her to our group).

She recently broke up with her bf, and i have been helping her through it and giving her advice.

I think she is interested in me now. At least i think? Here sre some signs:


- Has been messaging me a lot more asking how my day was, making conversation, sending memes directly to me instead of our friend group.

- asked if i like make up(she loves make up and her ex bf hated it)


- asked if i would ever want to travel (i'm assuming to meet me?)


- i have called her by her username as joke since i have known her and she always said it was fine when i asked if she didn't mind. The other day, she asked me to call her by her actual name from now on in a really shy voice.



I'm not sure if she is interested in me as a friend or something more.

I really, really do like her and would love to date her, but idk if i'm able. I don't even have a job or a license because of my depression...

I feel so lost and confused."
144,You want the real truth or the fuzzy truth,"Them: ""How's your day been?""

*""I slept as long as possible in my clothes, woke up, forgot my meds, spent 6 hours watching suicide videos and browsing the internet crying, relapsed on self harm, starved myself all day, and haven't left the house except for groceries in months""*

Me: ""Yeah it's been alright, bit of a lazy one, how about you?"""
145,Hoping to link up with experienced Zoloft (Sertraline users) regarding side effects,"I'm taking 200mg/day of Zoloft/Sertraline having come down from 500mg/day. On 500mg per day (High doses are given occasionally for OCD)

Side effects started after being on 500mg/day which were skin abrasions and face and scalp acne were more prevalent, ,the skin abrasions and acne were not healing and the same with the normal day to day abrasiens on the feet and legs etc

The skin seemed slightly weaker than usual as well. Since reducing to 200mg/day the non healing effect has reduced

Has anybody experienced anything similar with any of the SSRI family of medicines and would you stop taking this medicine based on these type of side effects? All help, advice and shared experience very welcome"
146,That thing in your head that you are fighting,"Well, I've been trying to make myself better for a long while, years now. I supposed to be down to earth, but because of it I am constantly with the head in the clouds and that makes me to stupid shit without realizing and I am disappointing my friends and family. I'm trying so hard to control that for years, but i'm at my end of my powers. Cleaning, showering, waking up early to make a coffee eat and go to work, I barely do that because of that mental string pulling me away and makes a great pain in the chest.... and there is another voice of sorts that keeps yelling: ""COME YOU PIECE OF USELESS SHIT! MOVE! MOVE YOUR GOD DAMN LAZY AND SHITTY BODY!..... And you didn't... again... Of Course, you can't do shit, you will never be able to do shit. Just work, get the money, go home and sleep.... You buy even frozen food that is easy to prepare... And you like to cook, you fucking blob of meat! Hell, even that guitar is sitting there rotting away, the papers of your notebooks are getting fucking mold!""   
That thing... is right...but I don't have that strength anymore.... I accepted it and just.... be.  I don't have the strength to be creative anymore... I don't have the strength to do something I like anymore.... Hell, even stopped going to gym because I feel tired every single day and I can't make my legs move there and do it.   


What's worse.... is that I miss doing these kind of things.... But my mind just don't want to work... My soul is in constant pain, my chest constantly strangled. I don't even remember what was last time I was actually able to breathe lightly."
147,Need advice,I have no motivation to do anything. I feel like I have no dopamine. I'm stuck as fuck. Never tried anti-depressents. Should I?
148,my mom always told me that cardinals are our loved ones from heaven visiting us. i haven’t seen one in months.,"my depression has been making me give up hope. and giving up on what i believe in. 

these past few days i’ve been really struggling with what i’m to do. if i still believe in anything or any hope at all, that maybe i’m stuck like this forever and there’s no point in trying.

and i’m not really religious or anything and will probably never be, but i haven’t seen one in months and i really think it’s a sign from someone to keep trying

i was having a breakdown in my kitchen and looked out the window (sounds like a movie going on here) which i usually do to calm down, and saw a cardinal 

and maybe i’ll be okay. maybe i won’t. but at least there’s hope somewhere"
149,Posting here doesn't really help me at all,Am I the only one who never feels better after posting here? I don't know why I expect talking to random people to help but I have nobody to talk to in real life so I sometimes come here. I always just end up going to sleep feeling shitty and waking up feeling worse. I think I'm going to try to kill myself in a month or so but I wish it could happen sooner.
150,ok,"First time posting, im not sure if im depressed or not but i know i need help.

I can't deal with my emotions, get unbelievably angry so that i sit in bed scratching my hands till their bleeding.

I don't feel like I have anyone to talk. not close to my dad, my mums depressed so cant lay it on her.

Sometimes just wonder what the point of life is like i cant even talk to my fucking friends about this shit, when i left for uni we 3 said we'd stay in touch but they make no effort to meet and they know im struggling but just assume ill get it over it i guess.

Just feels like know one gives a fuck and idk wtf to do, currently just do xans when im feeling overwhelmed n it makes everything worse but fuck it idk what else to do got so many negative tgought going on in me head.

idk what i expect from this just didnt know where to vent all this shit."
151,vent about not being able to feel anything anymore,"Today someone told me that everyone perceives feelings differently. The intensity and depth of an emotion is variable for each person which means that even the feelings that we think are mutual are actually not equal. I can’t help but think that because my feelings are overall either nonexistent or too intense I will never find the happy balance two people need for a relationship. I know that we did not work out and although it has been 2 years I still check up on you without letting you know but even when I feel like I am doing better you find a way to cross my mind. I will never try anything again because I am aware that your ''feeling of love'' for me can never compare to what I felt for you and although it took me a long time to accept it, that’s okay."
152,Things get worse as I get older.,"I'm 30 now. My life has been pretty bad. I got acne when I was 9, and it ruined my confidence. My friends betrayed me at 13, and it was the beginning of me not trusting people. At 17, my anxiety/depression is triggered after a stressful junior year. I got physically sick on the stage at my school play and ran off, unable to finish the show. My dreams to be an actress are shot, then. I get a degree in theatre, thinking I could be a voice actor instead, but that dream goes nowhere. I get awful retail jobs that further ruin my views of the world and human beings. One of my managers told me to 'get over it' after I told her I had anxiety and couldn't do on-call shifts. My high school friends betray me now, mid-20s. I'm off my parents' health insurance and get two incurable ailments at the same time, tinnitus and interstitial cystitis. This sends me into a deep depression. I'm put on depression meds and I feel better, and get free insurance from the state. I still don't have a good job, and I realize more and more that doctors, managers, friends and family will do nothing to help you. I try to find a job where I wouldn't have to work with people. I find the perfect one, but they refuse to hire me. I'm stuck at a job that only has me work once a week for three hours. My parents are losing their minds, and the older I get, the harder they refuse to listen to me. I need to resort to screaming to get my point across, and then they get mad at me, still treating me like a child. I never had a romantic/sexual relationship. I try labeling myself to make myself fit a mold: asexual/aromantic, misanthropic, mildly autistic.

I have good days, I have bad days. I ask 'god' why all this happened to me, even though he clearly doesn't exist. I ask him why I never got what I deserved, even though I've been good and played by the rules. Shouldn't good people be rewarded? Everything I've tried to do has failed. Why bother trying anymore? My mother still brings up that I don't have a proper job. She doesn't realize how much that hurts me. She never understood me. Nobody does. I'm unable to function in society anymore. I can't stand talking to people. Picking up the phone makes me anxious. I can't mentally take anymore failures. Applying for jobs is pointless because I never get the job. I'm even trying to make a living off of cosplaying on Tik Tok, but like most of my endeavors, this one goes nowhere. Life shouldn't be hard. Good people should be rewarded. People should get what they deserve. Things shouldn't be like this."
153,I don't even know anymore...,"First of all sorry for my bad english i speak spanish mostly.
To be honest i don't know why im posting this i kinda lost hope on everything, im not looking forward to the future im just stuck suffering a lot. Years of psycological abuse sometimes physical, my parents divorcing at a very young age and my mother was really beating me just because i remember her of my father. Then the teenage fase begin and it came around with depression. 
I just cant look forward i just want to end it all, all the abuse, the blame for things i didn't even cause all the things that are wrong with my family that somehow ended being my fault despite me not even being close or born to begin with.
I really dont know why im making this post... i really want to kill myself but at the same time just want some courage because i just cant do it. I tried multiple times from cuts, to intoxication i just cant my life is a mess but somehow i still want to enjoy from my grandparents before they are gone, i still wanna make sure my brother doesnt end up like me i just want to be happy but being the bastard of the family just makes me the target of everyone rage and frustration."
154,I feel like my brain wants me dead.,"I have had severe depression and anxiety since I was about 14. I am on meds right now and have been to therapy but nothing seems to change the fact that I can’t stop fantasizing about killing myself. I find myself dwelling on it daily. Even though my life is alright at the moment (i have a decent job, and am in a serious relationship) I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m destined to end my own life."

I've been trying so hard to find another job since I lost my last one at the beginning of november. With the holidays coming up, I feel so completely down. I have nothing to give anyone. I've been trying to recover from a cold in addition to everything. When is this misery gonna end?"

160,Why is it wrong to kill myself?,"I don't want to live, I suffer.
Stuff doesn't ""get better"", it has been years.
Death sounds so appealing, serene, like bliss.
I know that it will hurt my loved ones, but I can't be a slave to them, and in the end they'll die too and it will be far away from every living person.

I'm on the edge. I don't think killing myself is giving up, it's the rational and humane choice."
161,"If anti-depressants aren't a long term solution, what should I be doing now, while taking them, to prepare for when I stop?","24 yo female, I am about 3 months in to taking sertraline, now at 100mg. 

For the past two years, I was having suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. My anxiety was so high that I was struggling to attend social gatherings, university, even my work. Every single moment was spent in misery, I was crying non-stop, shaking non-stop, hating myself non-stop, wishing I could just die and not have to deal with all of the negative feelings non-stop. 

I've been in and out of therapy since age 14. I've always leaned on self harm as a coping mechanism for my negative feelings. I've tried mindfulness, CBT and talking therapy. Nothing has worked. My default setting seems to be unbearably miserable, self-hating and wishing for death. 

I eventually learned to get used to these feelings. But over the past two years specifically, they have been unbearable. 

I went to the GP and was put on sertraline, beginning at 50mg, now I'm on 100mg. 

My anxiety is finally at a normal level. I get anxious, but the episodes are short lived, lasting around 5-10 minutes tops, whereas before it seemed to go on for hours. 

I'm not crying constantly anymore. I feel sharp, awake and more in control of my emotions. It's easier for me to understand what I'm feeling, without being overwhelmed to the point I break down. 

The suicidal thoughts that have been a part of my daily life for the past few years are mostly completely gone and when they do occur, I am far quicker in dismissing them. 

I guess, what I'm trying to say, is that I feel better now than I can ever remember being. I no longer feel at risk of causing severe harm to myself. 

Looking on the NHS website, it seems that anti-depressants are only prescribed for 6 months to a year generally. Going back to the way I was 3 months ago terrifies me. 

What should I be doing right now? If anti-depressants aren't something I can continue taking for the rest of my life, what can I do right now to prepare myself for when they are taken away?"
162,"This isn’t directly about depression, but hoping some of you can relate about taking Wellbutrin?","So I’ve been on Wellbutrin (bupropion) since January of this year. Just a backstory to why I’ve taken it is its been pretty helpful in not wanting to kill myself and helps me brush things off much easier than before. I was feeling guilt from ending a relationship in 2018 and directly moving on to someone else. It killed me inside for 8 months. 

But anyway, I’ve realized this antidepressant has been affecting (or helping) other aspects of myself. I used to get sick constantly, I’d have at least 4-5 colds/bronchitis a year and I haven’t been sick once this year!!! The only time I was sick was over the summer because I got tonsil stones, but it wasn’t horrible. 

Also, although people have said Wellbutrin doesn’t affect libido... I still feel not as interested in sex as I used to be. I’ve even been off birth control and that my libido would sky rocket like it did in the past when I was off it... but I still feel like I’m on birth control in that sense. But, I’m pretty sure Wellbutrin is causing my periods to be lighter and I don’t have cramps nearly as bad... if at all. 

The only thing I’ve been on is Wellbutrin so I’m assuming this is all due to that, but I can’t find anything on google about either. 

I want to get off Wellbutrin soon, but I don’t want to go back to getting sick all the time lol."
163,Please help me,I feel like I want to die. I’m on sertraline right now to help with panic attacks from anxiety. I’m now feeling so so depressed. I spend a lot of time on my own so I would love some comments with words of encouragement if that’s okay. Thank you in advance xx
164,"Doing the most basic of tasks can be impossible when one is depressed. How would you feel if someone offered to clean your room, your surroundings?","Would you allow it ? Depression is in the same classification as someone breaking a leg/spine. One is physical the other psychological. 
With the physical injuries they get the help to clean their surroundings meaning they can focus on recuperating. 

I am interested in your thoughts..."
165,Job and careers feel like the end of me,"When I'm unemployed I get terrible depression and desperately search for anything

I eventually wind up finding some shitty job

Sometimes I'll stay for a few months or just a few days because of my depression and anxiety 

My longest job was 2 years and I am now 25

I can't seem to hold a job long term and I think at this point something has to be done about my mental health first

Therapy costs a lot of money and idk what other options I have to get better mentally

I'm so tired of these jobs that pay nothing and treat me like shit my mental just can't take it

I'm finishing my bachelors in a few months finally and hope to find a better job after that but I just feel so stuck

Sorry I guess this post is just a big rant but has anyone else dealt with this?"
166,Relationship ended when starting taking duloxetine - has this happened to anyone?,"So, I have been on depression/anxiety  medication since sixteen. In the last ten years, I have had my fair share of panic attacks and super low depressive episode, but what has really gotten me in the last two years is my depression. I have had trouble finding motivation to even function during the day. So my doctor prescribes me duloxetine (cymbalta). Within the first few days I noticed an extreme mood shift, I was happy, had tons of motivation, and was extremely productive. 

I was more confident and I saw myself starting to change. So naturally, this caused a lot of tension between my partner and I. We had been together for 8 years and suddenly, it was like I had some new found courage to walk away and went from being in love with someone to “I love this person, and I might want to be with them, but not right now-maybe? 

I feel totally insane talking like this, but I’m curious to know if anyone has never experienced this. 

Sidenote - I decided to get off the duloxetine because I felt like I wasn’t sure what was happening and if I was throwing personal relationships I may have cared about away for my own personal happiness. Anyways, it was a total nightmare, worst experience of my life to get off of, but now I’m starting the process of trying to figure out how I actually feel without the meds. 

So if anyone has taken duloxetine or similar medication &amp; felt this I would love to hear your story as I’m trying to decide do I live my life on the medication and that’s the “real me” or do I just get by and that’s the way I’m suppose to be."
167,Today is one of those days,"I'm sad. So sad.

Never cried so hard. Drank half a bootle of wibe hoping I could sleep. I cant. I know I am depressive, I have been trhough therapy for 3 months, it only gets worse. I fear of being a burden to my family, to my GF, and to loose them.

I am a piece of shit. I suck.

Who could possibly be fucking proud of an unemployed 25 yr old who never went to college, has no aspirations to do so, no goals, no dreams, and hasn’t had any luck in getting hired after quitting the highest paying job they’d ever had? There’s nothing there to be proud of in the the least.
Just some suicidal fuck that can’t keep shit straight for more than two seconds before the next bullshit break down comes along.
Nothing has ever been enough. My best is a joke, and not even worth a laugh. There’s nothing to me."
170,Same Shit Different Day,"Every single morning I Just feel numb. I go to school, and still feel numb until around 1 PM. Going home is probably the worst part of my everyday life. I live in a bad neighbourhood, in a tiny house. I'm actually not really worried about getting robbed or something like that, I worry about other people. When I invite my friends over, they usually arrive complaining about some junkees who stopped them on the way over here. Some of them can't even talk, so it puts all of us in a really uncomfortable situation. Then there are the kids. There's a house in my Street Just filled with kids who can't even talk properly, and are Just complete assholes because of Their asshole parents. They jump in front of moving cars and shit. A few days ago my dad almost hit one of them. Seriously, WHERE ARE THEIR PARENTS?!?! Anyway, so I also live in a small house, and have to share a room with my parents. As a teenager, I really don't feel comfortable with this. After coming home From school I usually shout with my parents because of some stupid thing. Going sleep is also a Hard task, because the Bad memories of the past Just keep me awake. Then there are my classmates. A big part of my class consists of snitches, liars, and Just simply assholes. I only have 2 friends if I think about it. I don't really talk to or hate everyone else. At least my 2 friends are there for me... So yeah my daily routine is:

Wake up feeling numb

Survive another Day with a bunch of assholes

Go home

Shout with parents for some dumb reason

Try to go to sleep through 3 hours straight

Repeat"
171,How do I explain this to my friend?,"So, today I talked to a friend after I ignored her for a weak because I felt too shitty to respond. She got mad at me for not reaching out, but I just couldn't. Right now we are fine again, but I'm just wondering: how do I explain to her why it is too hard to contact anyone? How do I explain to her that I know anti-depressants are not great for people, but to me it might be a way to maybe feel a little less terrible? How do I explain a depression to her and also explain that talking about it will not magically make it dissapear? At best it will make me emotionally drained. 
Any tips on a good explanation? Maybe a metaphore?"

Nothing seems interesting, not even for a job.

Yes, I'm not privileged-never been to a beach, never had a pool party, convention, sleepover or other fun stuff; never even made good friends because I was raised by a narcissistic bithc, or because nature made my own blood brother better in every physical way---even color(he's white, I'm black for some reason; I don't give a shit consciously).

Suck at meeting people above my physical score even though I've been hit hard by existential crisis, and don't think anyone's any different to interact with.

Overall, everything is messed up with me."
174,So I have to ask: Does anybody just look back on/recall a bad experience they had in the past and just...sorta breakdown?,"I remembered an incident in which I was kid and was sent to bed early for no reason when we were gonna have friends over, and my mom felt the need to tell them about it and then come in the room and be all like, “Oh quit crying, you’ll live” in the most emotionless tone possible and leave. I think said friends even said “goodnight” to me whilst I cried. It was just one of many humiliating and upsetting things to happen to me when I was young. And remembering it now I physically shuttered and even cried. And now my heart hurts but at the same time I feel nothing. I wanna cry even more but lack the energy. Besides, I have drivers ed in a couple hours. I certainly can’t be emotional then. But I just don’t understand what I’m feeling. I have moments like this where I just randomly remember something bad that happened when I was a kid and I just...want to breakdown. I don’t usually cause it’s not the time or place but I want to. Now I don’t even wanna do my drivers ed today but I can’t cancel. So I just...I really don’t know. I want answers but I can’t afford therapy. So I’m just kind of stuck. Am I the only one who deals with feelings like this?"
175,"Feeling guilty for not feeling depressed? It's weird, idk.","I feel guilty for not being depressed. Only when I don't close my eyes to reality, every now and then, do I experience the total uselessness of life. In the past, I've been \*/truely\* depressed, having like.. diagnosible symptoms, such as complete lack of motivation, slowness of thought and physical movement, lethargy, not leaving my house, my bed, crying at random moments for nothing, feeling the worthlessness and guilt and shame, with the only desire left being to just disappear and stop existing.   
But lately, I am closing my eyes to the true state of my life, the world around me. And I am succeeding at it! I am closing my eyes and feel fine. Never great, never excited or truely happy, but fine. Just ok. Which is ok for me, cause I know and remember how I could be feeling otherwise.   
But then sometimes, there are these moments that I don't feel fine with closing my eyes anymore. Those are the times of feeling this weird guilt for not being depressed, because I feel that being depressed is the most sensical response to the world one could have.

Anyone else experiences this guilt about being blissfully blind to the true, raw feeling of being depressed? And if so, what do you do?"
176,My mother is toxic,"Long post.

My mother shouts at me anytime I cry and she says i make her miserable and I’m the reason why she has depression. I can’t move out for another 5 months and I really don’t know what I’m going to do. She’s killing me and she makes me feel horrible about myself like I’m a burden and that my feelings aren’t real or allowed. She shouted at me 5 minutes ago to “cheer up” after she made me cry by calling me negative and miserable. I can’t take it anymore I just want to run away.

He was trying to explain how he felt and finished with ""do you understand""... unfortunately I understand too well. I've been where you are. I wish we could have talked and I would have told you that you are ok to feel pain. So many people shame you when you lose your will to live.  Like you're less than everyone else in that moment. I have lost my will sometimes and I hope you made it though the night, tomorrow is a new day and maybe you'll find what will drive you. Im sorry"

What am I suffering from? My official diagnosis is ""Major depressive disorder and Active psychosis."" From the little research I've done, major depressive disorder persists for months at a time and is treatable. I took high dosages of anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medications for a year straight to no avail. Nothing changed. I could have been taking placebos for all I know. I've not taken anything for around 6 months now and I feel the same as I did if not worse. I haven't seen a doctor in about a year too. Am I treatable? What the fuck is going on with me? What is my disorder if major depressive disorder isn't a substantial enough diagnosis and the treatment for that disorder has done nothing to relieve my symptoms of complete apathy, isolation, suicidal ideation and dejection that I experience every day throughout the day?"
185,"Please someone, I just need to know what is the point anymore","Everything is going exactly how I don't want it to. I'm falling behind in business and games design and I don't see an end to it all. One of the issues I've always had is poor time management skills, so all my lessons suffer as a result. I can't stop it, so I'm stuck thinking at best I'll get some boring dead end meaningless office job where I might get some sympathy from coworkers for sitting on my own and never talking to anyone else. Worse case scenario I don't even get that, instead I'm stuck at a fast food place where no one gives a shit about me. I don't even have any friends now. Instead I can only dream about being confident and having close friends. Please someone, is there anything to make life easier? Or am I stuck like this for the rest of my dull, sad excuse for a life?"
186,Not sure if I'm not eating due to a loss of appetite or to torture myself- or both.,"I'm 19. Have had a relatively normal childhood, with the exception of a death of someone in my immediate family (happened when I was too young to remember or understand) and some parental issues regarding emotionally abusive behaviors and narcissism. These experiences may have aided in my perfectionism and self-loathing feelings that I've been carrying with me since my childhood. Recently, I've noticed that not eating seems to give substance to the numbness I've been feeling. Instead of staring at my wall for six hours, tortured by my own self- hatred, the pain and discomfort of downing four cups of coffee on an empty stomach in the morning seems to make me feel better. I've had similar episodes ranging from a week to a month- month and a half. Each time, I lose quite a bit of weight (from March to April of this year I managed to lose 34 pounds solely due to this behavior). 

I don't think this is an eating disorder. I am in no way underweight. In fact, I could be considered slightly overweight. Although I would like to drop a few pounds, I don't believe that I am resorting to this self-destructive behavior in an attempt to do so. I feel like it's more of a method of relieving some of the numbness.

 Can anyone relate to the ""don't eat, feel accomplished temporarily, feel more depressed due to exhaustion and a lack of fuel"" cycle?"
187,How do I admit myself to a mental hospital?,
188,Broken jaw,"A few months ago I broke my jaw and my dr never did any followup scans despite my asking and expressing to him that I was in pain. I recently found out it didn’t heal right I can barely open my jaw and I have permanent damage to my jaw, I will never be the same because this guy fucked up and it was out of my control. I can’t eat solid food. I’m constantly hurting. I’ve lost over 10% of my body weight, and I’m going to lose a tooth after never having a cavity in my life because of damage he did during my first surgery. I just feel so defeated and I’m constantly reminded about my mutilated face every time I try to open my mouth because my jaw gets dislocated on the other side. I’ve already struggled with depression in the past and now I just can’t escape this feeling because my life’s been changed forever."
189,What do I do?,"Im having a really bad time. I cannot go to school tomorrow. I break down literally every single day at this point. I cut, burn, bite and hit myself on the regular. I have moments where I literally just go catatonic and state blankly into space without the energy to continue. I keep fighting and struggling, trying to get better but I always always fall down again. I wan't to be better for my family but I just don't think I can. I think about suicide somewhat often. I've tried to reach out, but I find that all that does is make the people around me sad or stressed. I've also been told to suck it up and take it like a man, and that I need to work harder at making myself happy. I've started faking happiness in ordner to spare my loved ones. What am I supposed to do? How do I ""make myself happy""? I can't eat healthily or exercise because I'm in treatment for anorexia."
190,Other half,"First time posting I’ve been reading here for a couple of months reading. 
The basic info:
Married 12 years third marriage for me second for him. His second marriage was awful(10yrs)my first was leads than 6mo and my second was a total of 17yrs. 
He had a father that was sexually abusive and violent. His mom divorced him after 33 years. His ex was abused and abusive too
I had my own pile of shit  growing up but years of therapy and growing I live a somewhat normal life. He always fought therapy and meds never admitting he had issues. 
We had our ups and downs but in the last few years his depression has peaked. He now has violent outbursts that I have been fearful of getting out of the car alive. 
Only a few people know about the real situation between us. His family has probably seen this before but no one ever said a peep. It now happens in front of our kids 19,13&amp;12. We were on the verge of divorce a couple of months ago but decided to work on us. I don’t want to raise our kids thinking this is ok. I do t yell, I don’t scream I don’t argue back. I talk in a normal tone and it drives him nuts, he gets more enraged. 
He wants to meet up tonight , he took stuff to temp move out and I’m good with that. I suggested a coffee shop for obvious reasons. Haven’t heard back but after this morning I’m done. I can’t hold onto an anchor and expect to be fine. It would have been different if he got help but you can force it. The hardest part is that I will always love him but have to let him go. 

Advice pls."
191,I wish I was sad rather than being numb all the time.,I miss being able to cry and get sad over things. Now I feel nothing all the time. I just want to feel something.
192,Nobody really cares,"Seriously? I've realized that no one really cares. Everyone sticks around for something, and once they get that something, they don't care. No one really cares about whether I'm alive or not, they care if I'm still gonna tell funny jokes and share memes. But if I'm suffering? God fucking forbid. I need a break from being their support sponge a few times in an entire year? God forbid. But when I need help, it's ""sorry can't talk"" or ""same"". I don't have friends that worry about or check up on me. I don't have friends then, period. I care too much about people who don't give a fuck about me at all whatsoever. I can kill myself and it'll take them a year to notice, and the only thing they'll be missing is ""aw they were so funny"". Fuck actual mutual friendships or actually being important to fucking anybody. When I'm gone they'll pretend to care. Cry me a river."
193,Is it really worth it,"I am so tired all the time. Like I just don't know what to do anymore. Most days, in fact, everyday I'll just sit at home and watch some TV and just imagine myself in their place. I can't sleep. The thought of not having the things I want is so disappointing. I've got no friends and I distance myself from people who care about me. I don't know what's going on and I don't know for how long I'll be able to continue this. I just don't know whether all this will get better. I hope it does. I really do."
194,Shutdown....can’t move,So I haven’t been able to physically get out of bed for 5 days. I get up once in the morning to pee. Haven’t eaten either. Today is the first day I felt like I could type after taking some vyvance. What should I do? Contact my psych? Meds don’t help. Other than adderall which got me out of bed for a few hrs last time this happened in February (prescribed by psych - off label). Thx.
195,End of the road,"I’ve sent out plea after plea , I appreciate the kind people who try and help others, I feel especially close to those who suffer, because I suffer mentally, physically and emotionally. I’ve got everything planned to try and help myself, I even got a therapist, just one problem... money, I can’t afford to pay my therapist because I spent all my money for my kids, I guess that’s dumb of me to do but I just don’t want to disappoint them. Not only that but I have a bad flare of ulcerative colitis and I also can’t afford the medication to treat my symptoms they won’t even let me book an appointment without accepting a payment, I’m negative 14 dollars in the bank... I get up I try and shake off my depression, stomach pains and my weary mind and go to work because my family depends on me. I am a single father. I want to type more but I don’t have the will, if there’s a god please save me, I’m dying, I don’t want to fail them but I can’t get back on my feet for falling down."

197,I hate my life I want to ramble,This morning I went to 7/11 to buy ice coffee. I put it in my bag when I finished because I don't like littering. I put it in my bag notice later that my assignment is basically unpassable.
198,I wish something bad would happen to me So i’m so I have a reason to be depressed and not just depressed for no reason. So I have a reason to hate life and wanna die so when people ask me why i’m sad I can say something,
199,I would want to kill myself but I don't have enough reason to do so,"I find myself having days where I'm going through every single thing that I could do and not finding interest in a single one of them. The day that I'm writing this consisted of me struggling to pass the time. I just don't feel like I am fit to be a functioning human being cause it's been so long since I've had a longing for something, or a goal. It just all feels meaningless and the genuine happiness I do get every now and then is so short-lived that it doesn't seem worth it. At the same time I don't even feel like taking my life is worth the effort so I'm just waiting around for the moment when I do have the energy to do it. I hate it cause the only thing I get mad about is how I'm not doing anything but I don't like doing things because they require effort. Idk man I felt like telling somebody and this seemed like a decent place to do it."
200,my dad made a comment,"So both my parents have diabetes and I’ve always told them that they could start doing exercise and it can help and all that and they always say yeah but never do it well this time I told my dad the same thing and he says yeah and then he says “i should just die already and be done with this” and I said you and my mom need to stop saying things like that because they do they always say shit like that but anyways my dad then says “it’s just when you were younger and you wished you’d always die and what not, we’re just learning from you” and I was taken aback and straight up told him that wasn’t funny. I literally shut down, after working out I had a small panic attack don’t know why but I told my mom that he said some stupid shit and I was mad but didn’t go into detail as to why because Idk if I’m overreacting or not because I can’t talk about my problems and depression without feeling like crying so I avoid it at all cost. So yeah idk if I’m overreacting and in my family my depression thing doesn’t exist to them I can’t really talk to anyone about it so I bottle it all up and I know it’s been getting worse but I just wish shit like this wouldn’t get to me"
201,Today I died,Alright .... Today the last piece of my human self died. I will never be the same. I will never love again. So be it. Same rules apply
202,What does depression feel like?,"So... Since last summer I've veen feeling very down for about three or so years at that point. But after summer and moving school (or up a grade don't know what it's called in English. But we moved to a whole new school but also not) I think it kinda faded away.

I've always thought it had depression in those three years but sadly never got diagnosed. So I doubted myself cause of the ""selfdiagnose"" shit. But now I feel like it's coming a bit back but not that intense. I'm not sure if the feelings are coming back or if it's just my anxiety (diagonsed but I still soubt about the anxiety)

What does depression feel like?"
203,anybody else get triggered by random stupid shit?,"like seeing someone who looks better than you, which in my case is everyone"
204,School presentation,"So today I had a school presentation about the social issues in the novel “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”. So I was really proud of myself for actually having the motivation to do the project in the first place.  I got to my slide about child abuse in the novel which includes violence and mental abuse, so then I go my next slide which talks about present day examples, and one of my examples was Michael Jackson. My teacher started asking how that relates at all to my presentation and why I was making filthy lies about a great man.  So fast award hours and ya boy just talked talked to the principal. Pretty much I have to have every project I do vetted every day now because I use “inappropriate shock value to make people feel uncomfortable for my own amusement”  now I don’t know where they got that idea from because I don’t try to. I just use humor as a way to stop myself from seriously having feelings cause if everything is a joke I don’t have to deal with my extremely severe depression. So in conclusion, I would call my life a joke, except jokes have meaning."

209,I don’t even know what’s wrong with me,"I woke up this morning feeling pretty good. In fact these past few days have actually been relatively enjoyable. I thought I was finally getting better.

But here I am again in bed. It’s a constant cycle that I can’t seem to stop. One day I’m on top of the world, confident I can do anything, and I’m happy. But one minor thing and all that comes crashing down. I feel it in my chest, like something is weighing me down. I begin to get insecure, anxious, and worst of all I’m alone in these thoughts.

I don’t want to deal with this anymore. I wish it could get better, but I feel like the lows have become more amplified just within the past month. It’s not even just sadness anymore. Sometimes it comes out as anger, or jealousy, or even aloofness. It makes me hate myself when I get like that, because I just want to be a friendly and nice person.

Yeah, I think I’ll stay in bed today. I went grocery shopping this morning but it was too much for me. I got all this food and I’m not even hungry anymore."

Tomorrow, I will start taking Wellbutrin and Revia. Has anyone else ever taken these 3 medications together? Has it helped you? I have so much anxiety.. I don't know to expect. Again, I don't want to go into detail, because I don't want to ramble.... I guess I just need help easing my mind."
212,I’m done with life I’m ending it today,"Goodbye everyone,I’m done with fucking life"
213,"Life is constantly up and down, more down than up lately","I’m new to the thread and this seems like a place I can vent my internal thoughts. 

This past year hasn’t been the best for me. I just got back from Korea, via the Army, and was being young drunk and stupid downtown Savannah GA celebrating my return to the States with friends. I was just crossing a street and got ran over by 2 vehicles. 

Fast forward 12 months and i’m through with physical rehab, all my treatments, and now im working an internship while being part of a transition unit trying to return to the Active Army.  

I should be happy and grateful that my recovery has gone well and im pretty much back to normal, hell even started dating someone seriously, but im just not happy at all. Im not as mentally sharp as I used to be and i’ll suffer permanent (but minor) mental deficits for the rest of my life. I’ve been out of my actual job for a year and that’s put a big dent in any upward career progression. 

I just feel like im in limbo as this return to duty process keeps dragging on and as I sit at a desk doing nothing for an internship, that barely benefits me besides telling the Army I can still work, the more negative thoughts brew in my head and how much I begin to think im worthless or how my life is stuck. I never used to think like that and for the past 3 weeks or month i’ve been in this depressed crappy mental state. 

Most of the time I just don’t want to see anyone anymore, even my own family, my mom, sister, and dad always say they miss me and want to spend more time together on weekends when I can see them, I know I should feel the same way but I feel nothing. The only person  I like spending time with is my girlfriend but even then im still iffy. 

Its like im more comfortable by myself, even though it kills me on the inside. Im finding less joy in my activities like working out and playing my favorite video games or playing guitar. I just find myself doing it out of habit rather than enjoyment. 

Sometimes I just wish it ended that night I was ran over, when I was feeling so great and doing well at my job."
214,Being Betrayed,"That's how I feel.
I've been living with clinical depression, PTSD and other issues all my life. There were ups and downs, but I kept figting. But now I don't feel I can fight anymore. I'm too exhausted, too lonely.
My parents, brother and couple of friends died within the last couple of years. It's been devastating, each year I buried someone. 
Now I lost my best friend too, not to death, but... he's made my life a living hell for the last three months. He had been like a dad to me, but now, for no reason, he started lying to me, accusing me of stuff I didn't do and gave me six feet under in the end. I've tried to talk to him, but there's no way.
All that made my depression bigger, I'm on heavy medication, but still feel like dying...
He knows me really well and I'm sure he knows how harmful this is to me, he just doesn't care. That's the most painful part... that he doesn't care... despite of everything we were through together.
I've never wronged him, but he treats me like a trash.
Too tired."
216,I just got out of the mental hospital after 8 days.,"You guys, I know there are some horror stories out there, but it helped me so much. I’m like a whole different person now. I’m happy, I have energy, the world doesn’t seem grey anymore. I’m not 100% cured obviously, I still have a few depressive moments, but I’m not incapacitated by my depression anymore. Before I went I wasn’t showering, eating, drinking water, nothing. I couldn’t function. Going to a hospital where all I had to focus on was myself and my mental health helped so much. I didn’t have to stress about school, or relationships, or the million other things that stressed me out daily. I had therapy 3 times a day, plus a recreational therapy that changed every day. The food was actually really good, I made a ton of friends, and 95% of the nurses were really nice (except angela, fuck you angela). 

I just wanted to share my positive experience, because it really turned my life around. I got meds that work, so many coping skills and life skills, learned how to set my boundaries, and how to take care of myself and live life. There is hope."
217,Recalling shameful memories.,"Does anybody also keep recalling the stupid decisions, the moments when you acted like an idiot (mostly when being drunk), the times when you neglected something and now you take consequences? It is like a curse for me, killing my motivation to be someone."

219,I'm almost sure I'll get fired from work cause of my depression.,Once again I called out from work because I'm so damn miserable. My depression makes me mentally exhausted to even take a shower. I have no passion for anything. I don't care anymore. I'd rather stay in bed and continue wishing to never wake up again. I can't keep a job for more than a year cause I always end up in the same pit. I don't know what to do anymore...
220,Is my depression manifesting in new ways?,"I (M, 40) have been struggling with both social anxiety and major depressive disorder for a long time. I have always been a shy, socially awkward person, but over the last few years things have seemed to have gotten worse. The day to day generalized anxiety and suicidal thoughts are usually pretty well controlled with medication, but my situational/confrontational anxiety is still horrible. I think that the depression is starting to show itself in new ways now. 

I have never been a very driven or motivated person. I can usually get the things done that need to be done, but lately (mostly the last year or so) I have let so many things that used to bother me go. Housework is pretty much non-existent now. I'm sitting here typing this, staring at a house that needs picked up so badly and it's driving me insane, but I can't seem to get any motivation to start. I was awake for a few hours this morning and then went back to bed and slept for a few more hours, and I still feel like garbage. I struggle to drag myself out of bed, go to work and put in the absolute bare minimum, and come home and sit on my ass all night. 

It is really starting to take its toll on me because there is so much that I want and need to get done, but I have absolutely no energy to start anything."
222,Any ideas to overcome long term depression?,"I was diagnosed with 19 years and now I am 30. Probably have been depressed since childhood.

In the past I cried every day and harmed myself with whatever objects I could get my hands on. Knives, broken glass, whatever. Been in psychiatric hospitals several times and cycled through all sorts of medications.

For 4 years or so I am stable, meaning I feel dead on the inside all the time. I don't self harm anymore.

I don't think, I don't talk and for the most part I don't feel anything other than the vague feeling that I should kill myself since I am unemployed and a massive burden to society.

Sometimes I feel sad, but I cannot cry or otherwise express emotions anymore and walk around with this goldfish face every day making everyone think that I am doing alright.

I don't have family or friends. I never had a job, I don't have any skills and I am permanently exhausted to a point that even simple tasks are beyond my capabilities.

Recently ended a therapy, we worked out a plan where I gradually increase activity and as a result my mental health would improve but I cannot even bring myself to do simple tasks like showering or eating most of the time."
223,Feeling like a non-entity,"For years I was super quiet, too quiet. But as I got older and realized I needed to make a change, I started talking to people more, getting better at conversation, and being more social in general. I wouldn’t call myself a total extrovert, but I’m comfortable talking to other people. But I still feel like I don’t exist to them.

My biggest example is work. Every morning I’ll say hi to people as I walk past. Sometimes it’s a simple greeting, other times it becomes a few minute conversation. Throughout the day, if I have a few minutes, I’ll stop and chat with someone I haven’t talked to yet. And those interactions always go well, I get the feeling that people there like me and enjoy talking to me, and as someone who’s extremely self-critical I feel like I would pick up on it if I was bothering them or something. 

But no one ever initiates those conversations with me. No one ever comes up and asks how my days going. If I come in in the morning and walk by without saying anything, they’ll never say good morning unprompted. If I didn’t go and seek out these interactions during the day, they just wouldn’t happen. On the few days I’ve decided not to say much, I spend the day alone without anyone coming to me. I’d understand if one or two people were like this, but it’s everyone. Anyone else feel like this? Social interactions like this have really helped me pull myself out of the pit and feel better about myself, but it all comes crashing around when I realize these people who seemingly enjoy talking to me every day don’t care enough to start it themselves."
224,I hate it when people rush me to get better,"I feel like I am being pressured to get better quickly. Whenever I tell them they need to be patient they just say they have been patient, even though it has only been a week since the last time they asked me if I was feeling better. It’s going to take time for me to get better, wether you like it or not."

226,I'm not good enough,"I'm not good enough for anything, I don't feel good enough for my friends, I don't feel good enough for my family, nor my dog. My cat died 2 weeks ago and I wasn't good enough for him either. I am a failure and it hurts so much to admit."
227,I no longer know what to do in my life,"I don't even know the point of posting here, but here I'm doing it anyway. I'm losing myself, I don't feel like I belong anywhere in this world, I don't feel I have a place I can truly call home. I feel like such an anomaly in existence that at this point my entire future feels completely meaningless to me."
230,Suffocating on Oxygen,"I feel hopeless. I want to cry but I cant let it out. I dont know what to do or how to make myself feel better... I have a relationship, with the girl of been longing for. I am succeeding in my new workplace. I am well liked socially and I am intelligent and do well communicating. But I just feel like there is no one that can ever understand me. Its like there is a void of emptiness swallowing me and I have no idea what to do. I sometimes freeze and zone out and think of all of the horrible things I could do to someone or something in the situation im in and it consumes me with this overwhelming feeling and I dont know how to explain it. I know I am a strong person but I feel so weak. It almost feels like im suffocating on oxygen. 

Long story short, Im just another rando on the internet talking to nobody so why care anyways"
231,I was a borderline alcoholic for about 2 months because of my depressing stressful life.,"The combination of taking stressful classes part time, living alone, boring ass isolated job/life, no friends and no significant other/intimacy made me start to experiment with alcohol as a coping mechanism to take my mind off things that hurt/bother me. 

Drinking because you’re stressed or feeling emotional  pain is probably the most depressing thing I’ve ever done. Id be on the floor in my bathroom crying, too drunk to even crawl properly every weekend and id drink a little on weeknights sometimes too after a long day of work. Ive slowly been losing interests in my passions and I’ve lost a few pounds from eating less and I quit lifting weights. I used to be a gymrat. Haven’t touched a weight in 3 months. Haven’t been diagnosed, but im almost positive its depression. 

Things are better now that school is over and I passed my classes and I’m going home to be with my family and old friends. Less stress. Haven’t drank in about a month. The 4th quarter of 2019 was rough for me. Fuck this whole year honestly. 

My depression kinda comes in waves.. usually fueled by the stress/isolation in my life. Some days are better than others. Im gonna enjoy the hell out of the “grace periods” like right now though. Im getting out of this stupid town in a few days! 😁"
232,Depression,"Drowning in my sorrow
Hope I don’t wake up tomorrow 
The time we’re living on is borrowed

What is there left to live for 
Waking up feels like a chore
 Life’s no fun when your poor
I hope I die soon somehow"
233,I think I have depression but I don't know what to do.,"Trigger warning I guess? 

Hi, so I think I've always known something was wrong even since I was a kid. I am just gonna tell you guys how I feel and hope someone answers. I haven't had much luck reaching out in the past. 

So some back story I've been through some rough stuff my father was a heroin addict and my mom has various mental health problems. My dad left us when I was five after physically and we believe sexually abusing us or allowing others too for drugs. I grew up pretty poor and my family was a mess. My step dad is a good man I believe but he was very mentally disturbed and wouldnt get help. He would smash his head against walls and pace and scream for hours when he was upset. When I got big enough I started stopping him he would struggle against me. He almost hit me a few times but would stop and run out of the house. I know he was abused by his dad. 

Sorry if this is a mess I am kinda crying and typing cause it's hard to remember this stuff. 

I've always felt useless and like I shouldn't exist and I tried to kill myself with a gun I was given when I was 16 but I couldn't. I wasn't a popular person so I've been abused alot by people outside my family. I guess people can sense when your a punching bag. I've had alot taken from me by various people. My parents stole from me , my best friend at the time stole a year of my work on a book I was writing. Every time something like this happens my brain obsseses over it for years. Sleep is so hard , I only ever sleep when I am stoned anymore. 

Fast forward and the feeling of hating myself and wanting to die come and go but are always there in some capacity. I start hitting myself when I feel sad. It makes me feel better it focuses me to feel the pain so I've kept doing it till about a year back. I know the things I do aren't healthy. 

When I was 23 I found out I had a brain tumor that ate my pituitary and almost killed me. It's not cancer but cannot be removed and I have till around 55ish to live. I am 28 now. I moved away from everyone and got a pretty good job and I thought that would fix me . I was wrong. With all the maintenance I have to do and my degrading body my mental health got worse . I started smoking weed after I had a memory resurface of something my bio father did to me as a child. I am not sure of everything in the memory but I get physically ill every time I remember it like something bad is about to happen then the memory cuts out. 

This past year I found the girl of my dreams and want to marry her I love her so so much. I would do anything for her. I am at the point now where the only time I am happy is when I am with her or I am high. I hate work , now. Everyday I want to hurt my self I am tired of fighting my body and my mind. Why am I alive if I am just going to struggle till I die before I can even retire. 

I keep alot of these feelings from her but I don't know what to do I don't want to feel like this I don't want to be like this. Everything feels pointless she's the only light I have left. I am sick of feeling like this . I want to care I want to feel happy without weed. 

I know probably thousands of people come to this sub with stories like mine but please if you have any suggestions id be really grateful."
234,"Suffering with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts since 2 years. I don't know why I'm living.","I have suicidal thoughts everyday. I'm done with everyone taking advantage of and playing with my anxiety and depression. I just want it all to end. My therapist bursted at me too, so that was out of the window. I've lost everyone, and most of all, I've lost myself."
235,First steps,I’ve decided to go to a therapist but I’m too anxious to go can someone please help by sharing his own experience?
236,Can we just say our fuck yous and move on?,I just wanted a dad
237,I Think I Need Help, I'm an addict in recovery and moved to MI from ND to work on getting my child back. But I can't do anything right. I keep losing good jobs because I sleep through my alarms or I just wake up sad and unmotivated and don't want to get out of bed. IDK what to do anymore but sleep. Most days I wish I wouldn't wake back up. What do I do?
238,Alcohol + depression is,"Like each beer is one step dwelling deeper into your depression. I usually do cocaine to bring myself up. I cant afford it this time.


SO EACH BEER IS ONE STEP DEEPER. 
I feel so suicidal how far can I fall.

Listening to dark music while drinking some san Miguel's. I take prozac too it's so amplified right now. Its fucking deep.

I have urged to cut myself am I truly playing with fire doing this.FUCK YOU DEPRESSIOAHAHAHAHAHXHHCDH

IM JUST SAD ALL CAUSE OF YOU!!!! ABAGHAHAHAAGGA
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
FUCKKKKKKK TEHAHHHH H H 

YEAHHHHHHHHHH"
239,I can't get out of bed,"Can't do anything well, always push people away because I don't know how to manage myself, can't stop the suicidal fantasies. I'm just empty."
240,The thin rope,"Love is the only thing keeping me alive. It's like I'm hanging above a volcano with one thin rope, love. It isn't even real love. She doesn't see me nobody sees me, I am a ghost. I can't sleep without thinking about suicide. Maybe this love is fake. What is love? I don't know do you? I've been told that if you are in real love you'd understand each other you'd know everything about each other, is it true? Still how can you love someone? She does not understand me. How can someone understand me if I don't even understand myself. What is this world, where am I? They may say that I am not normal an outsider, but who are they. They like to label us: autism, ADHD, etc.. Do I even want to live in this world?"
241,I feel so forgettable,"I wouldn't say I love being the center of attention. I kinda prefer being the quiet guy in the corner, but it sucks always second guessing who actually cares about my existence. I'm the go to guy if something is broken and a job needs doing, but otherwise people don't talk to me. I guess it just makes me feel like a tool. 

Don't get me wrong though. The people around me are good and they have good intentions, but I do wonder if anyone ever actually listens/cares. For example, telling them I can't attend a gathering for the tenth time every week because I have work at those times. I hate repeating myself. It's a terrible thing to hate, but having to tell someone a fact of life I can't change, every single week, is frustrating. It just makes it worse when they say they care and they're my friend but can't even remember that.

As selfish as it sounds. I'd be ""happy"" if someone went out of their way to send me a text that wasn't about work or asking me if I could put something together. They know I work 3 jobs and have my problems with depression. I go to counseling. I try and try to exist, but I just end up being a tool anyways. I just want this life to be over even if it meant I left a lot behind. I know nobody really needs me. If I really had to sum it up. It'd be someone asking me ""What would we ever do without you?"" and me just always remembering ""Then you'd just get a replacement."""
242,Having a bad day. Just here to ramble,"This morning I woke up and took a final. I was feeling so good. This is how it always goes. I wake up in the morning, and I feel good. I ended up getting an 86, which is good. Everything’s going good. And then I get into the car. I feel something in my stomach, you know that feeling you get? Yeah, that feeling. 

I get home. And I just break down into tears. I’ve been internalizing a lot of my anxiety and worries and feelings the past couple weeks because I felt like I couldn’t afford to break down with the stress of finals and everything else coming up. And today it just came spilling out. This is pattern in me is getting so exhausting. I feel wonderful, unstoppable, sociable, bubbly, and then I get anxious, obsessive, worried, fearful, and then I get depressed and sick to my stomach and hopeless and then things start to calm down and I feel perfectly fine. 

It’s always been like that. I’m on a mood stabilizer and compared to how I was without it, it has worked wonders for me. I know it’s working. It’s not exactly a chemical thing for me that’s been occurring lately, it’s more of me not being proactive enough about my mental health. Today I surrendered to that voice in my head (no, not an actual voice but you know what I mean) that feeds negativity and darkness into me. I took the bait. And now I’m laying here in bed. Typing this out. 

Does anyone care? Am I worthless? Am I capable of truly succeeding at anything? Will I make it in adulthood? Will I get a job? Am I destined to be a slave to my own thought patterns and mood swings? Are my worries and fears real? Does everyone secretly hate me? Am I cringe-worthy? Am I adored? 

I have loved ones. Friends. Family. A boyfriend who loves me unconditionally, no complaints about that. I know the facts. But despite all that, it’s so hard to say “fuck you” to that voice. It’s so hard not to give in and fall back to the toxic, old ways. Isolation. Self harm. Drug abuse. Lashing out at others. But I refuse. I do refuse. I will be okay. 

The sun will rise again. The sun will set again. I am reliable. I know myself. I know I can make it. I know I can make this world work for me. I will. I know I’m bound to mess up. I know I’m a mess and a disaster, but the beauty in it is that I always get through it. I did that. I did that!!! And I can do it again. I’ve done it everyday. I will continue to do it every single day. No, I’ll never be perfectly okay. I’ll never be the best at something. But I’m not God. I’m not an alien or a super hero. I’m not a robot. I’m only human. And I am me. And that’s enough. Because regardless of how many times I’ve believed all the lies, the deceit, from that voice, from others, I know the girl who’s deep inside of me. She’s been through so much, but she’s so resilient and beautiful and strong and so so capable. And I love her for that. 

I dont know anything. I don’t know if there’s a God. I don’t know if I’m destined for disaster. I don’t know if things will get better or worse or both. I don’t know what will happen. But I do know that I’ve always been okay. Even after the worst of the worst, I made it out okay. And I will be okay. That is what I know. 

This was a mess, and if you read all of it, thank you for listening. I just wanted to make sense of that."
244,told my doctor that the tablets I am on have started giving me nightmares (rant),"His solution as to give me a higher dose so I won't wake up quickly from them and remember them. I don't know how I feel, and I'm willing to try most things since the current dosage hasn't helped me at all.

It was pointed out to me that the fact they started straight away when I started the tablets makes them less likely to be related as they usually take longer to take. However, it wasn't until after I started having the nightmares I looked up side effects and found nightmares to be one.

I'm worried these will make me continue the nightmare for longer periods rather than help me forget them.

I don't know.

I've just had enough.

I need to learn how to communicate better."
245,I'm really a pathetic person and for that i fucking hate myself.,I really do hate myself like really.i'm such a bad person that sometimes when i'm doing something nice to someone or something i know that it is all for showing.i do not deserve to live.i'm entirely a different person in real that i think nobody knows because i'm good at not showing my personality but ofc sometimes i give a vibe that nobody likes and u know what...how hard i try the voice in my head never ever failsto make me feel like nothing.in real i'm just a very bitchy person foe whom you have no sympathy and you think that she really deserves it and on top of that i'm just really selfish who can never be genuinly happy with herself or anyone.sometimes i can't control my thoughts nothing.
247,I started thinking about how I'm a burden on my loved ones once again.,"I thought I'd finally found a way to not feel so terrible about my existence, I'd been feeling so well for the past month or so, but suddenly my birthday comes and everything spirals out of control once again. For some reason, these thoughts about how I'm such an awful person have suddenly come back, as well as the realization that my mental illness affects my family, and I can't help but feel like everyone around me would be so much better off if I'd never been born. It's like I don't allow myself to feel happy for too long before I start putting myself down again, and it sucks. I see my psychologist once a week, I take my meds, I try to think positively, but I always come back to this horrible cycle of self deprecation and self loathing that makes everything so much more difficult than it should be. And the worst part is, my family worries so much about my mental health, and whenever I start going through these rough patches, they feel bad, and I start feeling even worse about myself because I'm causing them so much grief. They shouldn't have to deal with this stupid condition of mine, I only bring sadness to their lives, and I wish I'd never been born, because their lives would be so much happier without me around to ruin everything.  
Sorry if it's incoherent or silly, I just had to vent about how I've been feeling.  
Thanks for taking your time to read this. Hope you have a good day!"
248,I hate taking showers. Is there any way I can motivate myself to do so?,"I'm not entirely sure why; I actually enjoy being in the shower (though less than I used to when I was not depressed). I think it might be all the steps required: find a washcloth and towel, find some clean clothes, get undressed, turn on the water, make sure it's not too hot or too cold, wash my face, wash my body, wash my hair, dry off, get dressed, put dirty towel and washcloth and clothes in the laundry... it's just too much! Same reason I hate grocery shopping and use a delivery service! But how can I motivate myself to shower?"
249,"Lacking physical touch, or ""skin hunger""?","I'm thinking the lack of physical connection is definitely a factor in my depression. I'm one to shy away from being touched by strangers in normal social settings or whatever, avoiding handshakes and awkward hugs whenever possible. But combined with my depression, and isolation, I am noticing how rarely I ever touch other people.

I started documenting when I touch people - last time was two weeks ago when a friend high-fived me. And that's the last time, before that, it was probably a month or so. And I've definitely gone longer than a month. 

It makes me feel... so disconnected. And so pathetic for not having this basic physical outlet. Does anyone else get this? Anyone have any ideas on how to work around this? Luckily an old roommate moved back in with their dog so I can be affectionate with the pup, and it helps, but it's not the same."
250,I feel so lonely.,"I'm currently living the lowest point of my life. Stuck in my room and detached from everything. My family is the source of my depression, today tried to fix things and I absolutely regret that. I won't ever hope for a happy family anymore. I'm tired of it. I only have one friend. He's my number one even back when I still had many friends. But I guess that's only me. To him I'm not his number one, not even a priority. I need his help but once again that's just another wish that won't come true. I'm hopeless."
251,Feeling numb and incapable of being able to live a good life,"I just feel so numb like everything i’ve felt is just feelings i’m used to. 

I feel really lonely.

I’m 17 so young. 

But i cannot help but feel like i’m missing out on life. I’ve never been to a party, never celebrated anything really. 

Home life is stressful but it’s gonna be over soon since i’m moving out.

Im quite ugly.

I do have friends, i can make friends. But i still feel alone.

I just feel i’m missing out on so much."
252,Question about family/friends support,"I'm just curious about other people's opinions on this- I've had my ups and downs in my relationship in the past and obviously it's not fireworks but we get along really well and I can't imagine leaving him. 

But when I get really down in the dumps like beyond the usual sadness and feel completely emotionless and on the verge of crying over anything, my only thought is wanting to go home and spend a night or two at my parents house across the state rather than going home, because they and my sister always put me in a better mood. My family is extremely close. Don't get me wrong, my boyfriend and I are very close, but does that seem normal that I don't find that same reprieve in my boyfriend of over 4 years now and still find that the best resolution is going to see my parents? It just does more for me being with my family than at home with him. Curious if anyone else feels this or if it's a sign that the relationship isn't really ""fulfilling"" in that sense."
253,I'm struggling with Christmas gifts and feel like a terrible father.,I've been battling depression for a few years now and this Christmas is especially hard. I've had to file for bankruptcy to save our house. With that and all the bills I don't have any money to spare on gifts for my children 3 and 10 both girls. I dont want them to think its because of anything they did. I don't know what to do and every time I walk into a store for anything I feel defeated. I didnt even decorate or setup the tree this year
254,I deserve to be this way,"I've been depressed sense around 8/9 y/o I was recently diagnosed with it but I declined meds. You know why? Cuz i feel like i deserve to be depressed. I'm a annoying bitch, a asshole who deserves to die and deserves to be this way."
255,Take some acid!,"I have been truly struggling and don’t consider myself very resilient was even to the point of giving up on Wednesday when my past caught up to me. Long story short went to a cabin for the weekend with a few  friends l, ate some acid and went on a magical journey. It was truly just what my mind needed it allowed me to unpack things. The sun came out and it sent me a message to not give up. I have always appreciated hallucinogens but have never before taken it when I didn’t think I was in a good place mentally but it opened me up to new thoughts n visions, it let me see the beauty that is around us but we constantly overlook. I stared into the woods and at water droplets nothing has ever seen so majestic. I like mushrooms too but highly recommend acid over mushrooms, the trip lasts a lot longer than shrooms but the overall feeling your body gets is better I would describe it as a cleaner trip. With mushrooms it’s usually good but I find my mood fluctuates a lot more. Either way don’t give up press on,  I recommend a spirit trip so hopefully you can find some good acid in your neck of the woods."
256,How do I slit my wrists without accidentally killing myself.,Dont try to stop me because ive made up my mind
257,I am nothing but a fucking pawn.,"I wish I could dissipate without anyone knowing, but I will fall to ruin, under the weight of the eyes of everyone. I am another slave, a puppet, a rusty tool. I will never find grace, and I'll never be satisfied with anything. Just throw a molotov at me and watch me burn, writhe, and scream. Gaze at me like I yearn to gaze at a similar fire when I finally put all of this behind me. My vision will be stolen for the entertainment of the majority.. It's only fitting, as I already gave myself the fuel. The best thing I can do now is try to accept that it will happen inevitably."
258,Good tunes to let it all out too?,"I’ve got a hefty collection of depressing tunes, but I’m getting a bit sick of em. Do you all have any suggestions?

Here’s some of my favorite ones;

My Pizza My World - Canarys (folk punky)

Gojira - Pray (metal)

Anything made by Dystopia (sludge crust)"
259,On Moderate Depression - The Kind That May Not Kill You But Stops Your Life Nonetheless.,"I don't know why I'm writing this on Reddit and not a private notebook. But I figured, there must be loads of people in this group might understand what I am getting at here. 

So. Moderate Depression. I have it. It's not bad enough that I have suicidal thoughts or behaviors of any kind. But it's bad enough that I've lost years of my life to it. Years that should probably have been the best of my life.

It's hard to explain this to people. When you say you have depression, the responses you get are split in two: 

1) You have the deniers who think depression is not a real illness, it's all in your head, it's just a fancy way of saying you're sad, etc. You know how these people are.

2) Then you have people that assume the worst at first. You say you're depressed, they interpret it as me being a couple of steps away from making a life-ending decision. 

But when you clarify that you're not, in fact, suicidal in any way, they lighten up. Perhaps a little too much. They give you some advice that you have likely heard a million times. Yes, go to the gym, will do. Eat healthily, gotcha. Wake up and go to bed on time, totally agree.

Never mind the fact that people tend to give you advice that you already know but can't implement because depression is a vicious, circular illness that prevents you from taking the actions that help you cure it. That's a post for a different time. 

What I really want to know is, why is depression seen as a binary sickness? Must we always see things in its extremes?Why must depression only be taken seriously and acted upon when it is a matter of life and death?

This likely applies to most mental illnesses. Either your problem is threatening to yourself and others and you need to be put away so that you do not do something drastic, or it's a non-issue. A thing that will eventually go away. Oh, you're depressed? Give it a few days. Have an ice cream. You'll be fine. What's that, you're anxious? Just calm down. Duh. 

It's very hard to explain to people how I feel because of all this. I have a few friends, a therapist who may understand what I've been going through. Maybe that's all I need in life. But not everyone is lucky enough to have these in their life. 

So to sum up:

Mental illnesses are not binary. They can exist moderately and still ruin your life, if not take it away from you altogether."
261,"My depressive mood is sometimes contrasted by these euphoric moments where I ""see"" the world in a different, more hopeful and beautiful way.","I hope someone can relate to this but sometimes when I'm looking out the window or just walking I get these completely random moments where I see the world differently and feel as if the future is bright and that everything is alright and good. These euphoric moments last for around 5 to 10 seconds and I feel all kinds of positive emotions and kind nostalgia when they happen. Emphasis on nostalgia because I get a kind of flood of nice and warm memories that pull me like a magnet and make me experience, even if for a brief moment just how the world can be seen from a more beautiful and positive perspective. When this experience ends (Usually when I look away and start focusing again) I return to my previous depressive and sad state where I get pulled back to reality and see how gloomy it is all around me.

It really makes me kind of sad because I can imagine how some people actually feel like this at least most of the time, or at maybe a couple of hours a day instead of just random moments that I get every couple of days or so."
262,(M/19) I regret telling my parents,"that i'm depressed and very lonely. they have no idea how i feel and i can't explain it.

1. You should go to this club that's meant for other lonely people like you, maybe you will make friends there? or a girlfriend?
2. No one is going to come pick you up from home, you need to make friends yourself, we can't help you.
3. Maybe try tinder if you want to find a partner?
4. If you want to talk to us then please do if it makes you feel better
5. Thank you for telling this to us, we will contact a therapist.

\-------------

1. No, i don't want to, i want to make friends, but i don't at the same time, i can't get myself out of the house or my bed.
2. I know, but i can't get myself out of the house or my bed.....
3. No.
4. Talking about depression has made no difference, only made me feel worse.
5. I wish i wouldn't have told you.
6.  I want to just fucking end my life."
263,Anyone else have someone who keep telling you to just pray your sadness away,"I swear to god, if one more person tells me that the depression that I’ve literally had my entire life is just the devil and that I need to pray to get rid of it, I’m gonna explode. Look I like religion and all, but these people are legit just driving me away from it. I can’t take having another argument about how it’s just all in my head and that I need to just change the way I think and pray in order for all of it to go away. Trust me if it were that easy I wouldn’t still feel so this way rn!!"
264,Looking for help,I don't know if this is the right place to look for help but I guess anything is worth a try. .my depression is become so heavy on my chest it's hard to get up anymore. Anyone have any way it helped them get out of this constant feeling.
265,Friends think my life is better than theirs but Im depressed?,"My classmates tell me that my parents are cool and all. They have good stable jobs. Im kinda spoiled but I dont over do it. My grades are high, and I have a decent amount of friends. I always feel uncomfortable when they say that Im lucky that I have parents like mine. Which I am happy. My parents give me everything I need but I always feel so empty inside. I have friends I can hang out with everytime and they are genuinely nice to me.

I just dont get why Im always feeling down. Its hard because I cant talk these kind of things to me friends or family because I know that they're going to be like ""Why?"". I cant answer that. I feel down everytime I wake up. Even when Im having a good time with my family or friends, I always think of something negative. Always feeling uncomfortable. I cry even if theres no good reason. Sometimes when Im just sitting on my bed, I can feel tears running down my face.

This one time, my bestfriend got 3rd in class while I got 1st. I was happy ofcourse but she cried. She cried because her mum would be disappointed in her. She cried because her mum would be angry at her again. Ofcourse I comforted her but my other classmates were saying things like ""This is your fault. Why are you 1st?"" and other things. You guys would expect that I would cry, but no, I just laughed it off and continued on comforting my bestfriend. When I got home that day, I went in to my bedroom and cried so much thinking ""What about me? My mum is also strict and would lecture the hell out of me if I dont keep my grades high.."" and ""Why are they blaming me when they should've congratulated me.."". I thought of it as unfair. I thought of things like ""Why was I on first? I worked hard though. Dont I deserve this?"" It was super unfair.

The next day, I went to school like nothing happened, while my bestfriend keeps telling me that her mother keeps asking her why he grades went down. How her mother talked badly at her and such. I just listened to this and thought ""My mum does these things to me as well? Then why?"" I just cant get how they can express their feelings to other people when I just keep my problems with myself. I keep it that way because I dont want anyone else to worry about me. I dont want them to catch my problems and make it their own as well.

When my bestfriend knew about how I was feeling she said something like ""Why didnt you tell me? If I knew your situation then I wouldve lowered my profile."" and that was the biggest slap to me. I hated it. I hated it when she said that. I cried because I worked hard and yet, not a single one congratulated me that time because my parents were busy, and my classmates were too busy comforting her. It sucked.

I cant be selfish. I cant do things for myself. I want to help other people but I dont want them to help myself because I dont want my problems to be added onto theirs. I feel shitty. I always smile, laugh, joke around, and stuff but I feel like I'm always alone. I always feel like nobody is there with me. I dont have anyone to share my problems with. It sucks"

267,I don’t know who I am anymore. My depression has completely taken over.,I don’t recognize myself anymore. I am not the person I used to be. I feel like my depression is in complete control and it defines who I am. I honestly feel like the only personality trait I have left is being depressed. I miss myself.
268,Need help,"I feel like I've gotten knocked down one too many times in life. I'm overall exhausted and find it hard to get back on my feet again.

I'm tired of pushing a boulder up a hill, only to have it crush me. I would give anything for peace of mind.

I'm swimming in debt and due to my depression am finding it difficult to keep employment.

I think my state of mind would improve if I was fulfilled, or felt like I was progressing. But like I said I'm tired of the endless grind. I've self-sabotaged myself countless times in small, and enormous ways.

I also am very unhappy where I live. The weather is amongst the worst in the us. Great sky and cold 90% of the year. In a suburb that offers no activities. An old, conservative age group. Everyone goes to the same bars and chain restaraunts. The only activities here are basically go to church, get drunk, or watch TV.

I live with my mom because I can't afford to stand on my own and my depression is crippling.

I was on a relative track to success previously, and was very optimistic for life, but a series of bad financial decisions, led to me losing my life savings and the debt rapidly compounded from there.

A couple months ago, I began feeling deeply suicidal. I felt I was watching my dreams die before my eyes as my body ages. I looked in the mirror and saw myself getting older, and realized that I profoundly failed to experience what I wanted to in life. My family is relatively content living in the same place and never leaving. I couldn't be further from this.

Anyway, as a hail Mary because I was desperate and didn't want to end my life. I packed my car and drove 3,000 miles. I didn't have a plan and it was bound to fail. I put myself in the whole for a metric ton of credit card debt. I wasn't letting the consequences and illogical nature of the decision hold me back because I needed something big to wake me up.

It was bitter sweet as expected. I had to go back home because I was homeless and had big payments coming up. I had a wonderful time and now I'm precisely back where I was with more debt than when I left. And the unfortunate sensation of knowing that my environment plays a profound role in my happiness.

The environment here is not conducive to my happiness. When I scroll down Facebook I see some people graduating college and positive stuff like that, but I also see lots of suicides lately. I don't want that to be me. I want to be happy.

I've talked about suicide for so damn long, like probably 10 years. I've always been just barley hanging on. But I don't want that to me be. I'm actually kind of scared to death because I feel so trapped and alone.

I've tried to talk to family, some understand more than others. But there's only so much people can do for you when you're feeling so negative and painful.

I don't know what I'm expecting with this post and I know it's long. I'll edit it later to summarize. I just need to vent and connect. Even if only digitally.

If anyone can offer any help or happiness thank you"
269,Should i get myself checked in a psychiatric hospital,"I've had moments in my life where I've been feeling much lower than now, but lately I'm just really really unstable.

I'm depressed quite a lot of the time, but i can still find happiness sometimes, the problem is that I cannot control it and it's usually a pretty extreme change (I'm not going to elaborate on this cause it would be a really long text)

I can get extremely suicidal 

I've been hearing and seeing people that don't exist.
I also hear people calling my name when there is a lot of noise.

I get nervous and anxious for no apparent reason.

I avoid things that i know will trigger me (to the point that it messes up my life)

I'm convinced nearly everyone is just fake and crazy and do things to slow me down and make me feel stuck (??? hard to explain)

I feel alienated and trapped by everyone, ever people that care for me.

My sense of self is fucked

I'm struggling a lot in writting, speaking, hearing and generally understanding things, way more than a normal person should. even making correct sentences is really hard (I'm 99% sure I'm dyslexic but it has never been this bad)

My memory is fucked and so is my concentration 
(I might have to edit this post because of things I've forgotten to add)

I can't seem to do anything anymore, I'm in senior year of high school and I'm just unable to do anything... I don't even know how i wake up everyday.
EVERYTHING seems to take so much effort.
I think i might be having a nervous breakdown.

If i just stay at home I'll fuck up a whole school year 
If i go to school I'll also fuck it up
If i go to a psychiatric hospital, I might still fuck it up, but at least I'll (hopefully) get better.

But there is one problem my parents, they don't believe in mental illnesses, as it's just ""all in your head"" and they just either don't believe me or just tell my it's not that bad, that I'm just weak and lazy."
270,I hope this helps someone,"For a while I was struggling to sleep because all I would think of is sad shit, failures and shit that made me anxious. It was the worst place I had been in a while, missing school and questioning living more than ever. As hard as it was to get shit done while I was in this state, I knew I had deadlines and stuff like that that wouldn't wait on me any longer. Not to mention more and more things were going wrong, shit in my house was breaking and we didn't have the money to fix it, other little things changed and I felt like the whole world was throwing everything it had at me to make me give up.

In the end I fought through to get these things finished and I felt a huge weight off me when I did, I still feel bad and I'm still not where I want to be, I doubt I will be for a while, I still have days where I feel numb, question what I'm doing and I still wanna be as far away from everyone else but I feel better. You're never gonna snap out of it, you're never gonna suddenly change, but that doesn't mean there aren't things that will improve you, I know every time I finish an assignment or export an MP3, it's gonna make me feel amazing, so I force myself to open up whatever I need to and try. Even if I don't make something I like or get anywhere, I know that I've still done more than nothing.

It's easy to give in, lie in bed, comfort eat and let life go on without you, but please don't. I believe in all of you and I hope you all have something that you can finish to get that same feeling I got, I also hope that if you are in that same place as me that this is the last thing you needed to hear before you do something about it. Best of luck to all of you. :)"
271,"Please help me, I need advice","Im thinking about doing a extra year because im failing and I need it. I’ve done my first year of A levels. My sixthform is closing. They said that I have to move to a different sixthform if I want. But they do different exam boards meaning I have to start from scratch, if I am still failing despite starting from scratch it becomes a huge problem because I have to pay thousands to do a extra year because im nearly 18."
272,i am unable to cry?,"i simply cannot cry i think?
like i get the tightening feeling in my throath and feel the sadness but tears wont come out. i try to push them to come but they just wont.
it makes me feel pathetic and i cannot push my shitty feelings away if i cant cry, it just turns into hurting myself and not feeling anything
what is wrong with me?
does anyone know? 
i really miss crying."
273,Fuck people with good health,They just will not understand what I have to go through every day and don’t make the effort to. They have physically healthy and mentally healthy bodies and I’m literally dying everyday from chronic pain.
274,Does anyone find therapy makes them feel exhausted?,"Therapy hasn’t been working, or I don’t think it has because every session I usually come out feeling deflated and exhausted, I’ve only been at it for 3 months or so and have only really had 1 session that I’ve felt really good afterwards. Is this normal? It’s not a problem with the therapist, she’s so lovely and I feel comfortable telling her everything but I’ve gotten worse, suicidal thoughts have got more intense and I can’t handle life much longer."
275,It dragged me down again...,"I have been in a alright place for a little now, I could enjoy how thing where going and bounced alright when trouble got me but the last few days took their toll on me and I can feel numbness settling again...
I don't know who will see this but thank you if you do.
My child got sick the last few days and between stressing over the idea of them not getting better and worried their fever would not stay down put me at a strange point emotional.
I also have been stuggling to see what's the point of drawing again, it seems I'm not getting better... I love to draw when I'm higher up in my mood scale but right now I'm too far down to see anything but the mistakes or negative commits others have gave me in the past. 

I feel silly that simple thing like drawing or people getting a cold can drag me down so far to start to feel numb around the edges. It will be amazing if I do post this since hitting the post button is hard for me. 

This next part I'm not sure but I think it's normal to get sad or upset about, me and my partner have been on shaky ground and this last few days made me realize that we have barley fix things between us. I brought up the fact it feels like me and them are back on this ice and they said we never left the ice. It hurts to hear that and makes me wonder what am I not doing.

I am sorry for the length of this and if anyone reads it thank you so much. I really do hope that your life gets better this holiday season."
276,Currently crying and rolling a joint,"Actually I haven’t even been sober for one evening over the last 1 or 2 weeks now I think.
Atm I’m just crying and I don’t know why, I’m just so unhappy and I don’t know why or what I can do against it"
277,Can’t run away from Childhood Drama any longer. How can I Cope?,"Mother, Student, Wife, dealing with Trauma from childhood that has followed me into my adulthood

I have been emotionally abused by my mother and sisters and uncles and other family members. I don’t know this keeps happening. But now it is effecting my current roles as a mom of two kids, full time student and wife. 

I recently went to my mom and told her that “the reason why I am so aggressive is because of how she treated me all of these years” she physically used to beat me up till I went to the hospital, told me I was dumb for school, used to check my vagina every time I came home late from hanging out with friends, side with my sisters over me, almost ran me over with a car because I wouldn’t give up playing basketball with boys, and when I told my mom I had a miscarriage she said “it’s normal, everyone has it” and when my aunt heard I had a miscarriage she told me “it’s my fault for the miscarriage because I was breastfeeding my son” in front of the whole family and nobody said a word. Even when I was 16 years old my uncle wanted to make out with me and forced me to be on top of him. When I told my mom she said “your uncle would never do that shut up” 

This is just a little bit of what my mom and family have done to me. My whole life I have been always been the person who takes the blame for them, and saves the person from getting in trouble.  

Even my sisters when they get into a fight with their friends I would fight their battles because they couldn’t fight for themselves. 

For the 28 years I have ever been alive nobody has ever defended me before. EVER! And to top it off i don’t have a lot of friends because of the way I talk. I speak so aggressively because of the way I was always in defense with my family. I always had to fight for myself. And I never received any love, from them. They are wealthy and try to show love by material things but all of that means nothing to me if I cannot even be treated right by my family. They don’t even treat me like a human being. 

After exposing some of this to my mom she told me “I deserved it because I used to give her a hard time as a teenager” I was in shock, I didn’t even know what to say. And than my sister laughed my mom response and said “well what did you expect?” All I wanted was an apology and acknowledgment for what she did. Because she cannot complain about how she cannot have a convo with because I am always defensive and speaking aggressively. 

Now, another recent incident happened again. Even tho I had nothing to do with it all. My sister wants to get married and I told her and my whole family that you guys have a history of blaming me even when I am trying to protect the family by doing good or bad. So this time, I don’t want to know anything at all. And don’t include me in any drama or problem solving y’all have for my sister. They agreed. 

Next thing you know my uncle meets the guy she wants to marry and says “the reason why we don’t accept you into our family is because her older sister is brainwashing us saying she doesn’t want you guys to get married, so she making the whole family go crazy by telling lies about you to stop this marriage from happening” the guy who wants to get married to my sister tells my husband (because they are friends) and my husband tells me what happened. Next thing you know my sisters boyfriend calls her and asks her is everything what your uncle is saying about your sister true?” And she said “unfortunately yes it is true that’s how my sister is”! I am sooooooo pissed off and told her “listen, me and you are done.” Even tho I told everyone in my family from the beginning that I don’t want to be involved they still threw me under the bus. 

Now this is affecting my everyday life because I live two doors away from my family (sisters and mom) so they are in my life even if I cut them out. All of this trauma and history is the reason it’s so hard for me to make friends, and feel loved because I never got that before. And now it’s affecting my life currently like emotionally as a mom and wife. 

I don’t want it to effect my mood but it is. And a couple days ago I just wanted to end my life. So my family just gets what they want by not having me exist. 

They give me NOTHING but bad things, trauma, abuse, and make me feel bad about things even if it’s not my fault. Now that my sister did that to me. My mom is giving me the silent treatment. Because she sides with my sister when ever we fight. 

What kind of mom would do that? I would never make my child feel like that? What’s the point of having kids if you cannot make the feel like they should be human and make mistakes and to feel. What should I do? How do I channel this stress through other sources of outlets? I don’t have any hobbies, and most of things are boring. Besides reading novels. What should I do? Any advise?"
278,"What is medication supposed to do, exactly?","I've been taking the antidepressant Escitalopram for a while now. I'm not sure if it's working as well as it's supposed to? Since taking it I don't feel like self harming, and I feel calmer. My mind feels so numb. Someone could be shouting nasty things at me and I would barely think anything of it. I remember at one of my old jobs my boss was reprimanding me, and my manager even came up to me to make sure I even understood what was happening. I just don't properly respond emotionally to anything, it doesn't matter what it is. People say I'm stoic. I'm not sure if this is a defense mechanism I've established after years of being fatigued with mental illness or the medication, to be honest. I have to feign my emotions - sometimes I come off as sarcastic. Having no emotion degrades my quality of life. This serotonin I'm being given seems unearned. I feel like I've taken one step forward and one step back."
279,I'm here for you!,"I'm here for you if you need help or anything. I'll try to give advice or suggestion at the best of my abilities even though i pretty much have none in the professional capacity to speak of. Whatever it is you're struggling with , you can beat it i know you can. All of you have so much potential regardless of age , gender whatever. Please don't kill yourself and please seek professional help. I might be in the same boat as you but i won't give up on you. You are precious to your family , friends. Don't let depression take hold , there are method to get better. There are ways to beat it and fight it. Suicide isn't a solution as i came to realize these past few hours after posting my own sob story. I see you all as human beings , something i never really thought of doing. I was feeling sorry for myself for so long without realizing there are others who have it far worse than me. I want to be there for you at your moment of weakness. I wish i could help you but all i can do is give you words of support and well wishing. I don't know what else to do to help people but will try."
281,Self harming in secret?,"Hi guys

The only way I can deal with my suicidal thoughts are by self harming to make myself feel numb

My parents don't understand anything about depression and see me like seeing an alien

I cut my thighs when I self harm and it's not accepted where I'm from. Scar tissues there are tough now and I bleed significantly not as much anymore and seeing myself bleed is important to me. Where else can I cut that people won't notice?

Are there any methods of self harm that I can do without people knowing? especially my parents?

Thank you"
282,Is rage a side effect of remeron,"My doctor put me on remeron and stopped me from taking the measly 2mg of Valium daily which I was on, stating the risk of addiction. 

As an alternative he placed me on 30mg of remeron at night and hydroxyzine (which made me sleepier and more foggy than the Valium did so Im not taking it)

I’ve been on the remeron for 10 days and I didn’t expect to feel so filled with panic rage at little things. 

Will this go away?

I called the doctor and asked for some alternative to the remeron but he just upped my dose to 45mg instead 

I hate this feeling"
283,Anyone else cry in front of others then spend the next day embarrassed?,"Yesterday I had a little breakdown in front of my wife.  Nothing in particular happened, I just was feeling overwhelmed and I needed a cry.   


So today I just feel super embarrassed about it and it just sucks. Like I’m already at the point where I cry for no reason, can’t we just leave it at that?"
284,I wish i was never conceived,I wish i was never born. Being born is the worse crap ever realising you have to fucking breathe and do f all. Honestly replace my life with someone else they can have it i don’t give to f’s about it. Thats me being brutally honest. Being conceived is like being embodied into something without your will. Its trash. Im not saying my life in particular is trash but overall if i was successful and still wouldn’t want it no thank you. Cease to exist is greater. i would prefer to cease to exist and or be in that state of non existence than be conceived. I know some will say its selfish but no one has to live if they don’t want to. No one. Everyone has the right to choose. if i want to cease to exist I’m allowed to. Im not entitled to anything but thats what i want at this moment. I would be happy to give my organs to someone who needs them. Honestly i give zero crap about this materialistic stuff.
285,"I didn’t ask to be born, why do I have to struggle.","I never asked for this. Being born was something that happened to me, I had no control over it. I can’t help but be so angry that just because my parents were horny I am forced to exist. I wasn’t even planned, they didn’t want me. Why should I be forced to continue on living when this life was an accident to begin with."
286,Do i pass a paper or no,"So I told my prof that I would  be passing my paper on monday and now its fucking thursday. I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO MOVE ACADEMICALLY BC OF depression fucking me in the head. Do I still pass a half-assed effort for a paper? Or just throw it in and apologize for not being able to keep up?

Honestly I'm tired man."
287,The Voice of (my)Depression,"of all the voices in my head  
i do not know how i am not dead  
i will tell this story from the mountaintops  
until my upturned face is red  


there are days where i cannot hear  
those days are full of abject fear  
a small voice says it will be alright   
do not worry, the way is clear  


the vision in my eyes is grey  
it persists, unending, throughout the day  
my head feels heavy and dense  
i just want it all to go away  


i can feel the blood in my veins  
my heart is held in by invisible reins  
it feels like it could just explode  
ending everything covered in red flames  


all the sounds i hear are dull and low  
as if from a whisper spoken three minutes ago  
i strain and strain and strain to hear  
alas, all the cosmos says is ""no""  


so i turn my frustrations to your world  
insults, barbs, and jabs are hurled  
if i cannot absolve myself  
a flag of hatred is unfurled  


the color of blood is so red  
was this the story in my head?  
i have finally put words to paper  
does this mean that i am now dead?"
288,I’m (M) a virgin at 22 and it’s eating me up. Never been in a relationship either.,"I have many other problems in my life but the one that’s nagging me the most rn is the fact that I’m still a virgin at 22. I never was very good with girls. I had a strict upbringing by my parents so I didn’t go out much in high school and the most I ever did was flirt with a couple of girls who I sat next to in class. I never could ask them out or tell them how I felt because i knew it would come to nothing and I thought my parents wouldn’t let me date. I never even kissed a girl until I was 19, freshman in college, although the virginity thing only started bothering me when I got to college. I also have suffered from depression since middle school. I tried to run away at the end of middle school and I have engaged in self harm in high school and college.

Come college I was still pretty clueless. I met a girl freshman year who seemed friendly but she friendzoned me. I made the mistake of telling the new  “friends” I was around that I was a virgin and they would mock me and said they would “try to help me lose it.” Eventually I ditched most of them. I went to clubs and parties and all and kissed girls but that was it. One of my close friends was a virgin and we could relate to each other’s struggles, until he got a girlfriend sophomore year and lost it. I felt even worse because of this because I knew I was the outcast now. I lied to my close friends who knew me junior year that I had lost it. Junior year I met a girl who seemed into me and we talked for half the year but ultimately it came to nothing. And most recently (senior year) I met a girl who seemed very into me (more than the others) asking me to study with her, hang, flirting etc. We hung out one night, flirting and walking around, but when I got back to her place, I asked her if she was just being friendly or actually like me. She said she didn’t know but later just asked me if I wanted to be friends (adding another failure to my book). Somehow she started talking about a relationship she had in high school and a couple of guys she had slept with and said she felt confident that her dating life has given her experience. She asked me what my relationships were like. I told her I never dated because I didn’t have the time, but lied to her about being a virgin, telling her I had slept with two people on one night stands, because I didn’t want her to think I was a loser. The whole convo made me feel worse because it made me realize how behind I am in life in this aspect. When my friends talk about their dating lives or picking up girls, I feel too scared to join in because I have nothing to add and I might say something stupid that will expose me.

It my senior year now and I feel like I’ll never end up with anyone. I can flirt with girls decently, and I do have a few female friends (who are not close friends though). But when it comes to sex/dating there seems to be something broken inside me. I have lied to everyone about this (even my close friends), except therapists, because I’m scared people will make fun of me or treat me as a child or even less than human, and girls wouldn’t want to date me. I know having this in my head is gonna make me feel worse, but feel the only way to stop having these thoughts is to have sex/relationship and I know that’s impossible for an idiot like me. It’s gotten to the point where when I see characters in a movie having sex I feel worse and even more of an outcast."
289,I don’t feel human anymore,"I have had depression and anxiety for years but these last few months it has gotten a lot worse. After my ex broke up with me last month I wouldn’t leave the house for days at a time but this is a new occurrence for me. Lately I have felt like I’m not even a human being, like I’m just watching everything happen through a screen or like I’m in a video game and nothing matters and it’s all going to end. Does anyone else feel like this or does anyone else have any tips to get over this. I’m now having troubles even focusing cause I just don’t feel normal. Anything helps thank you random people from the internet."
290,It feels so good to be seen (more ramblings),"I had to bring a dish to my moms job for a potluck. One of her friends came over and was asking if I was in school and how do I like it because she was thinking about going back. I said it’s going, I like it. She asked how I’m doing and I said not good. “Why not” idk “do you study?” No “well what are you going to do different?” Idk “do you want to be in school?” Not right now “well if that’s the case, you need to take a break. It’s okay you don’t have to be in school right now. Don’t do it because so-and-so is in school or because someone wants you to be in school. This is for you. If you don’t want it, you won’t give it your all. And I can tell there’s some more going on that you’re not telling me. I can tell there’s something heavy on your spirit but you can do this and you have a friend in me” 

A complete and total stranger to me knew I was going through something big time. She validated me. She said she’s here for me. 

I was crying of course but this made me so happy. I was literally balling my eyes out last night because it seemed like no one knew what I was going through. No one could even tell but I feel like I’m barely keeping my head above water.  My mom of course has said those same lines to me “you can take a break from school until you find your purpose” but she’s never actually there for me so it’s frustrating. She’s not proposing a plan or anything to help me out, which is something I expect a mother to do. My academic advisor has been more helpful than her in this time"
291,"Idk if the events that happened to me when I was young, caused me to have depression.","Hi, this is my first post on Reddit so please be kind.

When i was 10 years old I attempted to kill myself. I never really thought anything of it after it happened and I continued to grow up just thinking it was just something that happened. Even at that age I still remember how I felt so low on confidence and I hated myself and my life. I thought I was a burden on my family and friends, and no-one truly knew who  I was and or cared about who I was as a person. Now as I've gotten older, it has started to dawn on me that maybe what happened that day may be why the rest of my teenage years were filled with hatred for myself. I went on to attempt suicide a few more times since then but that one time has stuck with me since. I'm now 21 and am feeling much better about myself and life, but it still haunts me about what was really wrong with me, or if there was anything really that was wrong with me or was i just feeling sad for myself. 

Thank you to the people that read this, I very much appreciate it. I just wanted to get it off my chest. Any questions or wanna talk to me about your struggles? I'm more than happy to talk to anyone.

\*Please remember. You mean something to someone, always think about the people that love you before you hurt yourself\*"
292,my sister is turning 18 and idk how i feel about it,"she'll be turning 18 in 3 days. she'll be an adult and she'll go off to university and live with her bf.

 i lost my dad to depression, so I'll be alone with my mum for 3 years until i can leave too. homelife is great, i luv my mum it's not that. i feel like I'll be alone and we aren't kids anymore and this whole chapter of my life will be closed and put away to rot, and all that without my dad. it feels terrible.

 and a new year tenth is here too, everything changes and i don't like it. seasonal depression has already set in. and i just feel like not wanting to go on."
293,I haven't gotten myself anywhere but into sheer loneliness.,"I'll never understand how I can continue on this path where the people who I make friends with eventually and quickly abandon. I'll never understand how many times I have to change or how many times people will tell me it's me, before a different results happens. Before a few weeks I'm alone again, before after a few days my entire community of friends ostracizes me and I am left alone again. I don't get what it is that I'm doing wrong, but it hurts everytime nonetheless, and if everyone is going to just keep doing the same thing regardless, I see no point in trying, at all."
294,Breaking point,"I’ve been going through a lot recently, and feel that I’m being swallowed by my depression again. 

I had been working retail for a year and quit for a Full Time job with training, to only be let go after a week. I was so excited for the job, and now I have no job. I have no money. Struggling, and there’s no job out there currently.

I have been with my bf for over a year, and recently our sex life has been lacking. Made it a point that I need/want it, and we had a really big argument over it. He’s going away for a bit over two weeks and I can’t see him. There’s been a huge shift in the way he talks to me. He’s pushed me away twice. I’m fearing there soon will be a break up. 

I feel alone. Really deeply alone. I know I’m going to relapse on cutting myself. The only thing that keeps me sane/happy is weed and I’m too broke to get it. 

I feel worthless, and I have absolutely no one that even cares slightly. Feels like my world is falling apart too quickly. I’d rather die than be here, rather OD on pills. I’m tired of living with depression &amp; constantly struggling."
295,"Loneliness during Christmas pains me, it mains so much.",What more is there to say?
296,I can't get a break,"As many of you can probably relate, this year has been extremely taxing on me. I just want to vent to the void, if that's okay here. 

No matter hard life pushed me down this year, yeah, I got back up eventually, but fuck I just want to rest. I spent a LOT of time by myself this year, literally not leaving the house for days on end, and that was only when I was damn near out of food. I've guilted myself a shitton this year, and the moment I finally start looking more positive at life, something else slides in and knocks me back down. It's like I can't even win for losing. I just feel like I'm slipping further and further down a hole that seems bottomless. I don't think I'll ever completely get out. I think I'll always be clinging to the sides of that hole and able to see the top... but never able to quite reach it. 

I'm in therapy, but I've only just started tackling the depression side of my mental health. 

I know that SO MANY of my issues revolve around time and patience, but I don't have it. I was results NOW. I know things don't happen like that but FUCK. 

I'm just so fed up with everything. I want to just pack up and escape for a while. Not worry about all my problems. 

Thanks for reading."
297,Living with someone who has major depressive disorder,"My SO has a lot of diagnosed mental disorders/conditions (honestly not sure how to word that), but the main one is their major depressive disorder. We both used to think that while I was around, it wouldn't get too bad (as opposed to major thoughts of suicide/attempts while I wasn't there). Recently, however, there was a point where they wanted to kill themselves and I had ZERO idea. They handed me a bottle of pain medicine to hide, which I took as ""I don't want to be tempted to take too many because I'm in physical pain"". I didn't find out until after they made it through that episode that they were having strong thoughts of suicide. We've been together for almost 9 years now and married for 5, and I STILL have a hard time recognizing and appropriately responding to their depression. I feel like I would've been responsible for their death because I didn't realize what was going on. I want to be the one thing that my SO can always feel like they can count on no matter how dark things get, but I really feel like I failed them in that moment. They went several days having suicidal thoughts and I had NO CLUE.

Before anyone mentions something about me not being able to tell even after living with them for so long, my SO is VERY VERY good at hiding their thoughts and emotions. They went their whole life with these issues without mentioning anything to anyone until we started getting close. I was the first person they opened up to, so communicating about it is still very new and difficult for them.

I wish I could understand what it's like to have clinical depression so I can understand and help better. I feel like if I say the wrong thing or don't catch on fast enough, I'll just do more harm than good. I try really hard to always be that shining light, but I have my own emotions and thoughts too, and sometimes I'll react negatively towards something they do instinctively without realizing that they're not doing it on purpose. The worst is when they're going through an episode and have all these thoughts telling them to push me away and reject anything I say, so even if I'm super sensitive and calm they pull away or say things that they don't really mean like ""do you really love me?"" or ""I'm not good enough for you"". It's heartbreaking to hear these things and not be able to reassure them (believe me I try but nothing I say or do convinces them during their episodes). I just wish I could be better for them."
298,Off my chest.,"4 months ago, I had an almighty crash down to reality. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and stress. Something that I could normally cope with became impossible for me to handle. Work became even more horrendous, managers unhelpful, colleagues leaving me out and being vicious. 


I ended up quitting work earlier than I had anticipated. I could tell my husband was worried - although he never said that. He told me dont worry and we would cope until I start my new job. 


This made me feel even more terrible, I had put stress on my husband by making him the sole provider of a household with 2 adults and 3 children. Yet he has not once complained,but I can tell which makes it worse.


I feel a fraud at times, with my depression. I have things a lot of people would love for ( support network, family etc) but yet I can't shake the sadness.  I have an amazing husband who has been my rock, 2 amazing children, but yet they're feels like something is missing. 


I suppose im writing here because My husband always listens to me when I'm having a down day,  yet I'm worried I'm putting all my mental baggage on him. He got with a woman who had no mental baggage, and suddenly he's been lumbered with all this mess I've caused."
299,Mental illness has changed me and destroyed any good quality I had,"My mental illness has destroyed everything I loved about myself. I used to be nice, I used to want to go out of my way to help people, and now all I can think about is how they will fuck me over and I get angry at people easily. I used to have friends that loved me and supported me, they made me feel not alone but I made things weird and then they all stopped talking to me. I don’t have anyone to talk to and vent to, I don’t have anyone to spend time with. I used to have whole days where I was happy, now I just have brief moments. Every fun thing that I used to love (video games, TV, music) don’t bring me nearly as much joy as they used to. Fuck you, OCD, I want my own thoughts and my personality back."
300,i finally have everything ready to kill myself,"i know i'm a douche for the clickbait titlebut i'll allow myself more views since i didn't lie and if i go through with it i won't have a lot of interaction with this world and his people.

it won't be easy to do it, i have a strong survival instinct, my brain don't allow me to hurt myself too much and the mental pressure of ending your own life is enormous but... it's just what i want so i'll do my best to be strong enough to do it.

 i'm not happy here and i'd rather jump into the unknow that continue to live in a world like this. i could try to change the world but i know very well that i'm still too lazy to commit to it and even if i stopped it would still take possibly centuries to really change the world for what i personally believe to be better.

i'm not doing this post for people to tell me not to do it, to think of my family or that i can be happy.

i want to do it, i really really want to and this feeling was there for years now

i won't stay alive for the sake of my family, call me selfish if you want but i think it's even more selfish to expect others to live for your sake, i can say my life is my own and unless someone break me i will do with it as i please (within reason and my own moral code of course)

i don't think i can be happy in this world, the only times i was remotely happy it was when i was a child and it's only because i was clueless about everything, now that i know and see, now that i developed myself and my personality i really don't think i can truly be happy here. and even if there was something that could make me happy enough to make me want to live there would alway be something missing in my life, something that don't see how i could ever reach in this world.

in my own way killing myself is giving me a chance to be happy, i do not expect much people to understand what i mean by that and i even less to agree with me. 

i don't know when exactly i'll kill myself but in the mean time i'll answer a few questions, i'll talk with you guys (and gals). maybe share what i lived, how i see things and stuff like that.

i'll make another post when i do it unless i forget or don't care enough to do so.

what i want to say right now is that it's scary. looking at yourself, saying it's what you want to do and knowing that you can do it anytime now, that everything is ready in a way that work with you, it's terrifying BUT i want to be strong enough to do it, strong enough to go past my survival instinct, strong enough not to let myself live out of fear of dying.

i'm also exited, i want to see what's next, what await me. knowing that i won't be trapped in this world or at least in this life anymore make me happy.

i am sad to leave some people with having to deal with my death but it's for the best, for my best and it's all that matter in this situation.

i'll take time to answer some questions right now, then i'll go to sleep and come back to answer more. i'll try to answer everything i can and don't worry about what you can and can't ask, if i don't want to answer something i'll say so so feel free to ask anything you want"
301,Why am I still living? I just want to die peacefully,"I’m not gonna say that I am afraid to kill myself, I really just don’t want to suffer. I want to die peacefully in my sleep or from some random freak accident in which I won’t feel pain nor will I suffer. My mom committed suicide when I was 16. I’ve tried to fight the urges over the years but my entire life is shit on a stick. All that I do is lose lose lose, get taken advantage of and mislead. I think people around me think that I really don’t want to die, as is it’s an attention thing. But to be honest death is all that I think about. Everyday I think of a different way. I don’t know what happens in the afterlife, but at this point it can’t be as shitty as the life I’ve lived on this earth. I’ve lost everything and everyone that I consider close. I’ve lost financial stability. I hate to look in the mirror. I want to fill the tub with water but I always resist and rise from the water: I want to hang myself but there’s no way to do so in my home to my knowledge. I want to just be taken in my sleep. I hate being here I’m on the edge I’m on thin ice. Maybe today will be the day, maybe tomorrow. But it’s coming and I’m ready with my heart and arms open."
302,I fucked up,I was wondering for the past 3 hours why I have such enormous mood swings...then I remembered that I haven't took my medicine for a week....why do I keep forgetting this kinda shit...

304,Struggles,"I feel sad and tired all the time and just want to sleep forever. I don't have any financial problems or problems with family or friends despite that I miss them during the week (especially my dog), because off college. But because there are people who have a way more terrible life than me, I get the feeling that I can't be unhappy. I had these feeling already before I went to college and hoped it would change when I got into college. I often have the feeling that I'm controlled in life like a puppet doll. 

Today I had another appointment with my psychologist, but it's not making me feel better. I also don't want to talk with family or friends about it, because I don't want them to treat me differently and I know that when I tell one person about it, that my whole village will know about it. (This already happened with a friend) But the the appointments with my psychologist don't help is coming from me. I tell him the positive sides of story and hide things about my family that I want to discuss with anybody. Everytime I go there, I go with the mindset that I am going to tell everything, but during the appointment I just don't want to tell it to him. 

Furthermore I hate it that I Just can't tell to people how I feel. Often I get the question how I am doing, but I always answer ""I'm fine"" and it kills me. Every morning I wake up with a terrible feeling and just want to go to sleep again. And as the same as many here, I Just don't want to wake up anymore because of a heart failure or get hit by a car."
305,Just a big dump,"I dont really know how i'm depressed. I have caring and amazing friends and i started going through therapy, yet I still wake up everyday wishing I hadn't. I just cant bring myself to be emotionally honest with how I really feel around my friends. I sorta don't even think its me going through life anymore. Every time I laugh or am happy I dont actually feel anything, just constant sadness and it always gets worse and worse at the most random or inconvenient times. Like I'm some sad robot that just goes through its life on autopilot.

Dont mind anything in this post, I just wanted to get it out to the internet."
306,I am a failure,"I am just a failure, i never did a single good thing in my life and i keep hurting people i love. I feel like everything happens to me is my own fucking mistake and i need to die so people could be happier without me manipulating them"
307,Help me help my boyfriend,How can I explain to my boyfriend how he can help me. I don’t wanna ask for too much time as he’s an introvert and we live together.
308,"Just had my heart severely broken, I don't know what to do.","I've had heartbreak before, not like this. I was completely smitten, she actually made me happy.  Had, what I thought, was a great first date. Come this morning and she says we should call it quits. I have no idea what I did wrong and now I'm shaking and hyperventilating and crying, and the noose I have saved looks mighty friendly, as does my stash of pills."
309,Why,"Why do I wake up every day and wonder what the hell is wrong with me? Why am I always so sad, even though I have every reason to be happy? My life is good compared to so many out there, but I always just feel so down and sad and no energy.  I don't want to do anything, see anyone, be around anybody.  I put on a happy face when needed, but deep down, i am far from happy with myself.  I am not suicidal but don't care to live anymore.  I would never do anything to harm myself or others, but if I were to die tomorrow I wouldn't care."
310,I’m not lazy,Hate people assuming I’m lazy maybe if I didn’t lack motivation or have little interest in things I’d do them
311,I hate myself,"I'm a introvert girl and i really hate myself. I graduated 2 years ago. While all my friend now have a good job and settle down, I still jobless. I have chaged 3 jobs (all are different to ech other) within a year just becauce I feel like I cannot adapt the job despite telling myself to be strong. I have no enthusiasm and feel very uncomfortable, useless, maudlin, feeble, lonely,... I really don't know how to work like other people. I cry alone everynight because I think nobody can understand me. I don't want to confide to my family, my best friend or my boyfriend. Sometimes I really want to suicide (I know that's selfish) because there isn't different between I live or die. I make no value. So that is the only way that I can do to relief myself. Is anyone out there has the same problem with me? How can you get through this?"
312,"I texted my doctor ""I want to die""","Yesterday I visited my psychiatrist for my monthly appointment. At night I texted her ""I want to die"". She hasn't replied. Or called or anything. She sees me 2 years now, I know she cares about me, so why didn't she do anything? Of course she could be busy but she usually replies to me on the same day even if it's not something as important as this. Maybe she called my parents? But I'm not sure about whether they know or not. What is she even technically supposed to do at a scenario like this? I'd just like some extra opinions of what it could be or how I should deal with it. I'd really appreciate it."
313,I feel dead inside,"I am not passionate about anything, I form attachments but I don’t feel love. I hardly give a shit about my body. In fact, more often than not I wish I was someone else. That, despite the fact that I have innumerable more privileges compared to most people around me. The worst part, though, is that I don’t feel like this will ever change. I often think of what my life will be 20 years from here but I feel like I will still be this listless wreck of a person. And that’s after a year of anti-depressants.

My therapist suggests this relates to me being a child sexual abuse survivor. And it’s possible because I’ve felt this way my entire life. But I just cannot figure out how. I spent the past 20 years of my life telling myself that it was very brief, that I escaped, that I’m probably making a big deal out of nothing. And okay now I know it’s part of the process. But that doesn’t change the fact that I still feel exactly the same way. And despite of *all* of this I still have moments where I wonder if my kid brain just made all this up and created a memory.

I don’t want to feel this way anymore. But I don’t know how to change things."
314,Wave Depression,"One week I'll feel like I'm on top of the world, I feel like the most confident person in the room and then the next 4 weeks after that one it all comes crashing down and I feel like the same hopeless piece of shit I'm familiar with"
315,Hurts so much that you feel so many weird things,"Ever had an almost uncontrollable urge to pinch and scratch yourself with your nails, as if you want to sneeze and can’t make it go away until you actually do it?

Ever felt so strong a wish to stop existing that you get chills down your back? 

Ever hated yourself so much that you feel stuff stabbing you on your aching chest?

Ever felt so disconnected that you feel almost paralysed and no strength to move your limbs an inch?"
316,Do therapist even work?.,Honestly I just feel that I am just throwing away my money.
317,Who else gets super depressed at night?,I get so super depressed at night. It’s the worst part of the day for me because there is no one around to talk to and i don’t have a boyfriend so I’m all alone. My anxiety is also at its peak that time of the day so it’s extra hard. Gosh I had it so much. What do people do at night to keep from being so depressed and lonely 😞
318,I've been uninsured for almost half a year now. The job that was supposed to provide me with that just laid me off before it took effect. I feel like I have nowhere to turn.,
319,Don't actually want to die,"As many reasons I could find to end it all, minimally I could find 1or 2 reasons not to. I times it got me thinking maybe I don't want to die after all, I just want to escape from something I can't really control.. u feel me.."
320,Thanks😎,"Currently cute guys are my reason for living, so like thank you for making my day better with your attractiveness haha. Not joking. I'm really unhappy lololoololo"
321,Sertraline &amp; Food Help?,"I've been on 100mg of Sertraline over a year now and for the past few days food in the mornings makes me feel sick.  I take my medication in the morning as prescribed by my doctor.  I have had other instances when eating in the mornings has made me queasy, but it has become more often.  I am female, I doubt I'm pregnant because I have an IUD.  There have also been some other stressful factors playing in my life currently for the past couple of days that have caused me to have terrible sleep...I'm not sure if that also plays into this.

So what I am trying to get at is, for other people on medication, does it make you queasy when you eat after you take medication?  And if it does, how do you cope with it?  I'm open to all advise!"
322,On the edge,Ive been feeling out of control with emotions lately anyone else in the same boat? Like every negative vibe is pushing me closer to the edge. On top of that I am dealing with Hypothyroidism and Schizophrenia comvined with depressing thoughts and feelings...This year needs to end already
323,Speaking up for myself ends up in a mind-blank state of internal loop of worthlessness &amp; “not good enough”.,"When something upsets me I know from past relationships that I need to speak up for myself (instead of raking everything as my fault and silently let other people manipulate me like I did in the past abusive relationship). 

Having to speak up makes me so nervous and anxious and uneasy.  Once I face any negative response I jump to instant immense regret of ever bringing that up. 

The discussion goes on, and to be fair, the other person usually isn’t really being unreasonable. But my mind would eventually get to a state of non-functioning mind-blank... leaving just strong urges to scratch my arm with my nails as much as I could and a constant loop of “not good enough not good enough not good enough not good enough” &amp; “you don’t deserve this you don’t deserve this you don’t deserve this”. 

_Tldr: whenever more serious/difficult conversations arise in relationships, my brain would seem to stop working, and all that’s left would be worthlessness and urges to pinch and scratch myself. Wonder if anyone understands me_"
324,Am I invisible or does everybody just hate me?,"I feel like a ghost at the best of times. When people do notice me they just frown at me. People handing out flyers in the street rarely come up to me. When a lecturer says discuss with the person next to you nobody ever does with me, even if they're at the end of the row they'll talk with somebody in front/behind. Even on here nobody responds to my comments/messages.

I have very few friends and haven't made a new one in 6 years. I thought I had for a few weeks, until we met irl, they haven't spoken to me/responded to my messages since. Obviously there's something wrong with me and everybody knows what it is except me. How am I supposed to change if nobody will tell me what the issue is??"
325,School Sick days... like depression,"Remember all those days you stayed home sick during school? The boredom. The clock ticking. The laying in bed. The loneliness, wondering what your friends were doing without you.

Well. Now that I’m in college and have 0 friends and spend 90% of my time locked in my dorm, depressed, it feels that way. I haven’t hung out with anyone in years. I FUCKING HATE MYSELF! FUCK! I WISH I WAS DIFFERENT! FUCK THIS, THIS IS TERRIFYING!!!! I’M FUCKING STARING AT A FUCKING WALL EVERYDAY!!! I CAN’T DO ANYTHING!!!!"
326,I'm depressed and don't care if I have a baby,"I'd like to put a disclaimer out there first. I'm on the IUD and my boyfriend uses condoms. However, I know that if I fell pregnant I wouldn't care. Llim so depressed that I'm just apathetic and honestly wouldn't care at all. Im only in contraception because I know it's the right thing to do. But if I fell pregnant I wouldn't feel anxious or guilty or excited or anything, just numb. This really scares me as to why I'd feel so numb. Ideally I should feel something."
327,Thinking about it,"Since August, I have been in pretty intensive therapy following a few incidents around that time in my life, and for the most part, shit has been progressively getting better until about a month ago.
Work has been complete dog shit. I don’t respect my bosses, they hate me, the hours are long and I don’t even somewhat enjoy the work. My health has gone to complete shit as well. My girlfriend has been noticeably unhappy for the past month as well, and I would love to help her, I would love to do fucking SOMETHING, but it seems as if I can’t even come up with a positive thought to comfort her with. I can’t even comfort myself. 
Then today I go to the doctor, just to find out that one of the health problems I have been having is likely the result of an STI, and the only girl I have had any kind of sexual contact with since the last time I got tested (a year ago) is my current girlfriend. So she clearly lied to me about knowing her hook ups and ex boyfriend were clean. Apparently none of them had probably ever been tested. I don’t want to pay the price of her promiscuity and irresponsibility, yet here I am right? 
I just feel like I’m at the end of my fucking rope. I left out a lot of shit that still fucks with my from longer ago, but that shit honestly should’ve became irrelevant years ago. I just don’t fucking know if life is for me. I have felt pretty god damn ready to give up before, but just haven’t because I couldn’t rationalize it to myself logically.
Well, logically, I should die. I have felt far more pain than I have felt happiness, and ya know what? I haven’t even been around that long, so I BET the worst is yet to come. And I could barely take the shit that has already happened in my life, I feel like even one more bad thing will completely and utterly fucking destroy me. Why should I let that happen? I want to die with my fucking dignity! What’s so wrong with that?
I’ve just never been really happy. I don’t think I am cut out for this shit. I certainly believe that life isn’t for everyone, I seem to be particularly bad at it, and I just flat out don’t fucking like being alive."
328,best way to die peacefully?,"yeah, i’ve given up trying to find a way out. my outlook on my future depends on me being dead at the beginning of next year. I’m starting to see each of my friends individually and telling them how much i love them and how great they are, and there’s only a few things left i want to finish. but now I’m planning, and I want to go peacefully and easily. is there anything that I can drink at home that will send me out nicely? I don’t want to be the one that has to pull a trigger or use the knife and i don’t want my parents to find me hanging from a tree, so is there anything I can do to make this easier for me?

please don’t try to give me support, i’ve gone through so much therapy and have been on anti depressants for so long, I have no other ideas."
329,Depressed,Is it bad that I want to admit myself to a mental health hospital. I feel so stupid for saying it because at the moment I feel as normal as can be but my thoughts and silent voices in my head always come back and I'm just sick of it. I feel so selfish for wanting to go away to a mental health hospital (if you want to know why just go on my page and read my reddits because I just don't have then energy to explain) I feel I have no right to feel this way because to my family I probably seem happy and fine and if I was to go to a mental health hospital I feel like it would be throwing everything good they've ever done for me in there face I feel so horrible and guilty. Like they ask me how are you or are you okay and I say yeah I'm good because it's better and easier then explaining whats going on in my mind. I just want to get away from this life. To be honest I'm not living my life for me I'm living it for my family
330,Does anyone else feel bored?,"I don’t know if it’s connected to depression, but does anyone else feel completely bored, unmotivated, and done with life in general? Everything is bland and extremely uninteresting. I’ve lost interest in almost all of my hobbies and interests, nothing brings me joy and i’m constantly searching for something to make me feel again (i.e relationships). Idk

Does anyone know what to do"
332,Today is rough....,"Got that thing where something simple can send me off into a spiral. I got this motto of ""80/20"". 80% of the time I can conquer the world, 20% of the time it defeats me completely.

I just wish I didn't feel like this, that I didn't stress out and find it impossible to focus. I find it almost impossible to concentrate on my work when I feel like this.

It's like a dark cloud that just sits above me, and I have to wait until it goes. So yeah, I'd appreciate some love, advice, whatever.

Also, whoever created this subreddit is awesome. I always try to spread positivity into the world, and I've recently began talking about my struggle with depression on YouTube, but it's good to know there's a place I can come to and talk about it when things get hard for me too.

Thank you, all my love x"
333,Hi,"Hello, i am dealing with depression and bpd over 6 years and i just felt like i need support. It keeps getting worse everyday and i don’t know what to do anymore. My relationship is got worse and we took a break, i don’t have any friends because i ghosted them to be alone, i don’t have anybody to sign my yearbook when i am graduating (like in couple of months) and i just hate myself so fucking much..."
334,They’re there until you need them,"People often say that “I’m always here” or that “I’ll help you” but when you do actually need them they disappear.

Often they tell me that “you’re so negative, I don’t need that vibe” or that “you’re too dramatic, it’s not that hard”.

I fear that one day I may take my life and people are going to be like “I never expected it” or that “we never knew”, you know.. I told all of you."
335,Fuck money,"Every time I start improving I get hit down hard. I just got a letter from the state that my wages are going to be garnished over community college payments I didn’t make. My fault. Price of my meds went up, student loan payment increased, I’m so broke I just had to put groceries on a credit card and Christmas is barely happening for my daughter. I’m so incredibly sick of working SO hard everyday at my job and with my therapist with nothing to show for it. I hate waking up in the morning. I know all these problems are mine I just needed to vent. I just want to crawl into a hole."
336,How do you overcome hypersensitivity and depression?,"I don’t know if the two are separate but I would like to overcome this. 

I think I pick up on when people don’t like me too much. Sure, I am human, it hurts but I don’t think it’s healthy for me to care this much or overthink it. 

I am building up a healthy life outside of work and atm work is my primary world. I work long hours in finance, I’m in a new team and I get the impression senior management don’t really like me or don’t value me. 

I know why I am there but it’s tough not letting it get to you. I am applying for new jobs but I also get the impression this is just work. How do I control my emotions, hypersensitivity and defeat this fear?"
337,Can never be happy.,"I thought I could make myself happy by setting up the tree for Christmas. Been through so much this year, I thought this could make me happy. Only for it to be shattered when my dog chewed on the plug. Now it doesn't light up any more. 
Lesson of the day: Never be happy. By the end of the day, it will bite you in the ass."
339,..,"I'm angry and sad because girls don't pay any attention to me, i'm good looking guy, i really want to get girlfriend but i have social anxiety and i dunno how to talk to girls."
340,Mentally drained,"Sometimes when i wake up in the morning, i have some energy and will to do stuff...maybe study something or do stuff at work, but i noticed that when it gets past afternoon, feels like my energy got sucked out, i get extremily mentally tired and depressed, i can't even focus on anything.

Anybody relates?"
341,what should i do,"i’m in my senior year of high school (IB DP year2) and it’s such a busy time when i should be applying to colleges and think about my future, but i feel so hollow, like an empty shell of a person. i think i should kill myself because i don’t want to disappoint my parents and i’m too tired to do anything. i just want some piece."
342,I am a piece of shit.,That’s it.
343,I have to pretend Christmas doesn't exist,Just a luxury of normal people that I will never enjoy. I hate this time of year and I can't wait to get past Christmas and new years because I have no friends.
344,I'm really struggling this season.,"This christmas season is really hard for my mental health. I seem to be unable to take care of myself. Everything is exhausting. I can't really do anything until Christmas is over and not having anything to do is making me so sad. I had a fight with a friend and feel like I ruined my social group and my boyfriend does not really care. He is great but dealing with his own depression and I have thougts of infidelity and try not to act on them. 
It feels good to get all that out. I really want to know how you deal with all this, how you feel and what you do to take care of yourself. How you cope with the guilt of mit taking good care of yourself. And most of all thank you and merry Christmas!"
345,I feel so alone and so unwanted by everyone,
346,Are we all in this sub because we have no other outlet?,"I mean, I've reached the point where my notebooks are all full of my spilling mind. 

There is no one I talk to regularly about my depression, other than a therapist. 

If I don't post here or check in on others here, it all stays bottled and lonely. 

I think this sub is great. Even if we are feeling so defeated or alone in our individual battles, there is a community here fighting the same battle, just of their own circumstances. 

So, thanks for being here. Thanks for helping me not feel so alone."
347,"Maybe depression is wide spread, but your experience is only shared by few","I’m thinking there’s different levels to this now? Because I’ve always been depressed, but since about October, it’s been like the worst fight of my life to do basic ass things, and the whole time I just want to disappear. I just drink all days away. But what I’m thinking, some people can relate to me 100%, and some have a completely different experience. But making a scale would be kinda bad because there’s still so many people who fall in between. So I guess we’re all cursed to being misunderstood? My morning existential crisis, for today at least."
348,Dropping out of college,I'm 19 and I took exams to enter a public uni but I failed twice cause I was having a major depressive episode during. I joined a private college last October but I am dropping out mainly cause family issues are going bad and they trigger my anxiety and depression. I got prescribed remeron I hope it helps. I kept worrying that in college I'll get bullied again like in school so whenever someone didn't like me or ignored me I started having awful thoughts.
349,How do you learn to love yourself?,"I have lived with depression for the last 20 years without ever realizing it. Feeling worthless, useless, and a monster. Everything was my fault one way or another. I attributed all of my depression symptoms to being an extreme Introvert.

I have gone threw a long seperation over these last two years. With my wife now living with the guy that was my closest friend out here. (The three of us are on good terms now) but it has been difficult, and caused more doubts about myself.

I have flairs of depression and self loathing still. The feelings of being worthless and questioning why anyone would even want to be with me. It comes and goes.

The general consensus seems to be, ""learn to love yourself. Then you can find someone else who will love you."" But that still leaves me with my hands gesturing, ""ok, but how . . ."" I have spent too many years mentally abusing myself, putting myself down, and wearing a mask for pretty much every one. While bottling everything inside, and trying not to feel.

I have been in therapy for the last year, and I have come a long way in that time. But even so, there is the void of wanting to feel loved. And in essence, being to to love yourself first, doesn't really tell you how. Like trying to solve for Z, and being told you need to solve X first. With no other instructions."
350,so i got help today for the first time,"went to psychiaastrist for the first time

i had no hope but did it anyway. so i could just realise it was a pointless shit and no one could help me

it was a stupid 9min conversation , he didnt help me at all. he just said stupid stuff like read books and ""keep trying""

what the fuck i should try? its just stupid phrase. i dont even know what he meant by ""keep trying""

anyway he didnt give me any pills or stuff, but he told me that i can get a therapy session from a psychollgy guy. But im not sure if i visit one. it will just become some similar experience like this, and i will be even more annoyed

thank you :)"
351,"Please tell me I’m not the only one who thinks of themselves as having 2 different chapters.... The me before depression, and the me now, after it. I even place a year on I like it all went wrong. And I’m starting to connect the dots as to how it got here. It all started crumbling in 2009 for me","I was born in 1992 and like to think I was a very happy kid growing up. Thinking back now I was a anxious kid, but wouldn’t say I was unhappy or sad or mentally in a bad space at all. Just anxious (but at the time didnt even realize) had two siblings who are 9+ years older, but to make up for it I had LOTS of cousins my age. Loving grandparents. And loving parents that left everything behind in their country, came to America with 2 kids, and had me and raised me right.

I was a normal kid. In the late 90s- mid 2000s I just grew up doing kid stuff lol... riding my bike around the block, painting, playing basketball, playing N64 (James Bond!), watching Cartoon Network/ Nickelodeon and Disney channel, loved going to laker games, i was also in love with music (rap especially) at a young age and began writing raps at 8 years old. Writing verses and playing basketball where my main passions- I haven’t done either in 5 years. Just feel nothing when I think of it now

Which brings me to the second me... To me, the first version of me was from 1992-2013... in 2013 it all hit me like a truck. Idk why or how or when exactly, but I feel like it was a combo of things that began in 09.... but didn’t hit me till years later.



2009 my aunt (mom’s side) and uncle  were stabbed to death by 4 intruders pretending to be home buyers. This really changed a lot in my family. I saw my mom go through hell and I worried for her. Then in 2010 my grandpa (dads side) suddenly got pneumonia and passed away. My other grandpa passed away 2 months later from lung cancer. Then in late 2011? My dad gets diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. The doctor came into the room that day and told my dad and our family that he had 4-6 months left. My dad is still alive today which is a miracle but that’s another story. Finally, early 2013 I passed out and hit my head on the marble floor. I went to the er, had a concussion and whiplash but that day started almost a year of hell or me. For almost a year I didn’t feel right, my vision was off and mind was foggy. Which is normal in post concussion syndrome . 

But all those events I described just balled up and hit me at once like a truck I guess. And then came the concussion which turned me into even more of a mess. 

For the last 5-6 years I’ve been a shell of who I was. I’m only 27. But I feel 50. My whole body aches and hurts and is stiff. I don’t get to sleep until around 6-7 am and I don’t wake up until 2-3 pm. I stay in bed all day and avoid human interaction outside of my household. I go days or weeks without brushing my teeth sometimes. I’m a mess I feel nothing but sadness and misery. When I think of the old times I get sad and wish I was back. When I think of the future I get sad picturing a world without my mom and dad and especially my grandma (favorite person on this planet)

I feel like I’m just sticking it out for them. Once they are out I’m probably gone. I should have had a wife by now. Maybe a kid. A degree. But I don’t have none of that and probably never will. Honestly that would be the only thing to make me happy now. It is the only thing that makes me smile- thinking of a future where I have a wife and kids I can love and wake up and grind for. 

But what girl will want a depressed mess like me..."
352,"Depression, am I right?","I sat here and backspaced everything I've wrote for the past 20 mins. here I go. 

Im F/20 Years old and I want to fucking DIE. Had to make sure I put that last part in caps. Whoever reads this. Thank you. 

Im at a point where this just has to be a joke. Theres no way my mind can possibly dig such a dark hole for myself. Honestly it's impressive. Years after years of me battling with this. Constantly doing things to try to make myself feel better, feel happiness that last longer than a day. \[Attend college and get A &amp; Bs\] Fucking check. \[Finally date my highschool sweetheart who is also my bestfriend\] Also check. All these wonderful things....and my mind has the nerve to make me feel like this all the time. To feel like Im a bother.  What is your existence contributing to this world. That yeah you're pretty but not that pretty. (Also fuck u social media smh) but from aside that. I sleep for 10-14 hours a day.  Im loosing my ability to pronounce or remember words. Aka reading. This is a big one. I would say its from all the stress, my anxiety but I don't really know. My boyfriend is noticing it. Which is causing more thoughts to my already fucked up head. (He is supporting me through this). All I can say is i'm fucked. Like big fucked. I know I am too. Im smiling right now thinking in my head, ""You cheeky bastard."" Humor is how I save myself from not going to Home Depo to buy rope and making a knot, it has a certain name to it? I think it starts with N but I do not remember. It's how I cope and probably why Im still here.  I can also tell its dissolving. Fading away just like whatever crumbs are left in my sad soul. I really do love life, but my mind doesn't. As of right now I feel numb, I also feel like I could do it at anytime. I am finally getting put on medication when my insurance gets renewed finally January 01 2020. But It's been a year of no doctors. Just me myself and I. Trying to get through this. I hope I make it. I hope I get the medication and I feel better. I hope my mind can be generous enough to give me a few extra weeks. How kind, am I right?  Im unhappy. If you couldn't tell. I know this road though. I've tried many things before, reached out, gone to hospitals. Im just tired? Im physically and mentally exhausted. If you read this. Thank you. I have hope. I do."
353,Losing my faith,"I realised the other day that I hadn't prayed at night for the last few days (something I've always, always done) and so yesterday I made a serious prayer to God, but about half way through I couldn't shake the feeling that there was nobody there. This completely shook me - my faith means everything to me and it's literally one of the only things that I have to lean on when times are really tough. 

But right now I can't stop feeling that either God isn't there or He has given up on me and I'm not sure which one is worse. 

If anyone has any advice on how to rebuild their faith I'd be really grateful."
354,The reason why I was depressed before. I'm doing better. And I'm trying to get my life together now.,"I'm so tired being criticize because I'm not doing well: That I'm not perfect, that i dress like a tomboy, that I have mental melt down here and there because I'm too tired dealing with people, that I'm fat with my slanted eyes yellow skin, that I don't know how to dress well, that I do not know how to being around people, that I'm not supposed to be lazy, that I'm just a mental sick person that don't know how to put myself in a situation, that I'm not allowed to take time to do things that I like, that I'm not good enough, that I'm just a piece a shit that I insecured because of my trauma, that I'm just a sick person, that I should just leave this freaking world because the world doesn't need a person like me anymore, that I'm not allowed to be angry when people get into my save place or disagree with me, that people being ignorant towards my belief and my thoughts, that people being ignorant towards my personal boundaries. I'm tired of being judged, I'm tired that people just ignore that I'm actually exist, I'm tired being told who I should be, I'm tired just to be me..."
355,That moment when,"The moment when you realise you're trying hard to find reasons not to go home because you'll have to keep the mask on there - your darkness isn't welcome, no help is there.

So you sit in the park near your house for a moment of peace before you screw the mask back on and go in to pretend it's all ok.

Because god forbid you be broken. God forbid you need her to hold you up. God forbid you need her to help you be strong enough to face another day.

The moment when you remember how she sneered at ""weakness""
The moment when you know you can never trust her with your hurt
The moment when you realise what that means

And it makes it all worse"
356,Genuinely wish I'd never been born,"I know I was unplanned, it's why my sister's are a good 10 and 13 years older than me. I just wish that accident had never happened.

Even though I've considered suicide I'll probably never actually go through with it as I don't want to hurt anyone but honestly, not only have I found my 36 years of life becoming tiresome but I can't really see how I've enriched anyones life. At best I've been inconsequential, at worse I've actually held people back and that just makes me even sadder as I've not only screwed my own life up I've negatively impacted the lives of those I care about.

Wish my parents had used better contraception."
357,I think my time is up.,"Don’t get me wrong I love my family, but I can’t do this anymore. I’ve been exhausted by the thought of living for the past 8 years and I can’t go on anymore. I don’t want to die, but I really don’t want to live. Doing this would destroy my mum, she means everything to me even though we’re not that close anymore. But I can’t keep living this fucking shitty life just to have everyone else be content with my existence. I’m done. I don’t know how I’m gonna do it. I don’t know when I’m gonna do it. But I’m pretty sure I’ve made up my mind that I am gonna go through with it eventually. It’s my only real choice of escaping this constant pain. I have no reason to live, no hobbies, no interests, no enjoyment in life, no relationships, no job, no friends, no passions and no signs of ever getting better. I cannot help feeling like a waste of oxygen. Just needed to rant before I go. 

Don’t expect anybody to read this but oh well, at least I’m at peace with myself."
358,Intrusive thoughts,"Hello, I have frequent major depressive episodes and am on medication (SSRI) but I believe the does is way too low.

Lately, I have started having a lot worse intrusive thoughts. Usually I will feel very low and then experience some, maybe. But now, I've been feeling happy or pretty neutral with things going fine and yet I keep thinking I need to hurt myself, I keep getting thoughts of sneaking away at work to slash my arms and I keep thinking a lot of self doubt - lately its been hard to talk to anyone because I just get doubts about every thing that I say etc. 

All this yet I am very aware of it and know that these thoughts are not true. I know that not everyone around me.hates me, yet I cannot stop thinking it.


Has anyone else experienced this? And please, can anyone offer any advice?

 I will be eventually updating my medication but, I'm scared I'm gonna do something I'll regret."
359,It's my birthday today and i have no one.,Last year i was devastated but now I got used to it.
361,Dreamt about going on a date with my crush,"Just woken up from dreaming all night long about going on a date with my crush. I felt really happy and opened my eyes with a heartwarming sensation on my chest, but then I realised that all was a dream and reality hit me like a truck.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to tell somebody about this, but I picked up my phone to see that I didn't really had anyone to talk about this that wouldn't thought that this is totally silly of me... I feel really lonely and vulnerable right now...

&amp;#x200B;

(Sorry for my bad English, not my first language)"
362,Selvfishness and depression.,"Sometimes I use opiates, not a lot, but enough to put me in a good mood. One thing I notice is that I become aware of my regular, sober, selvfishness. While high I tought I wanted to put effort into something that would make the world a better place for everyone. I never have these toughts regularly, I never appreciate or feel like I want to give anything to anyone. I suspect my SSRI medication has something to do with it, but I am not entirely sure. I feel like I can’t combat this selvfishness, but it feels paramount for feeling food about myself.

Anyone else have any experience with this?"
363,Does anyone else itch like hell during/after an episode?,"I've had one of my most intense episodes as of late for the past few days and I'm itching all over the left side of my neck and body, and my scalp (which is also flaking). I'm sure this is not due to poor hygiene because I've been scratching like crazy since I got out from the shower. It's so frustrating"
364,Depression is turning me into a villain and I hate it :(,"I am an emotional person but also very calm, damagingly forgiving and no matter what words you throw at me, I won't belittle you in 99% of times just because I am angry in the moment. 

Now smth quite shocking and tragic happened that has been ruining my mental wellbeing for a year now. I have been blaming myself and being negative towards myself for all the time but now, when things are supposedly going a bit better, I am turning into a villain. I have withdrawn from communication from everyone basically but a parent who I live with and one friend who just would not stop writing. My parent has been verbally quite abusive always and I am getting triggered 100 folds when they do it now, same with a friend, I get triggered by simple things which is just the sign of huge stress and becoming a bad person. 

I hate this. I wish this has not happened a year ago. I do not think that what does not kill us makes us stronger always. Sometimes it breaks us. And I fear a lot that part of me has been broken for many years to come and without therapy, I may never even get out of this negative cycle myself. 

Do you also feel sometimes that depression is turning you into a villain?"
365,My circuits have blown. I know it's self imposed.,"And all I have shared, and all I have loved

Is all I'll ever own

.
But something has changed

I feel so alive

My life just blew up, I'd give it all up

I'll depressurize

.
Aahh...

Ten thousand miles left on the road

Aahh...

Five hundred hours 'till I am home"
366,"Would you rather live on as a monster, or die as a good person?",
367,I'm not sure if I have depression or not,"So, I'm 20 years old. And my favourite thing to do is stay wrapped up warm in bed and just layeith my eyes closed, not even necessarily sleep although I do like sleeping too. I don't really eat much or drink, I very rarely feel the need to and don't get much satisfaction from food, and tbh I have very little motivation to get up and get food. I feel pretty numb most of the time and don't really get excited for anything or find anything funny. I don't feel sad either though. I go through life feeling pretty apathetic about everything but I also struggle to identify my own feelings. A part of me just thinks I'm too lazy, sometimes I feel too lazy to even put something on the TV because if rather just lay and do nothing. I don't really get much out of TV or doing anything at all so I'd rather just lay and do nothing. I'm on antidepressants and have been on several different ones over the past 5 years but I feel like none of them work. I also don't really care about possible consequences. Not sure if this is just a part of depression or growing up. But I definitely feel as if I'll never overcome it because I've tried so many different things and I don't really understand how therapy can make me feel things again if that's my main issue."
368,My life should be going great.,I was just accepted into college. I’m going to graduate soon. I have more friends than I’ve ever had. So why am I still so depressed?
369,Nobody cares,"Nobody cares that you're sad. Nobody cares that you're in pain. Nobody cares that you're suicidal, nobody cares that you self harm. Nobody cares you’re not eating and sleeping right. 

Nobody gets your pain, nobody gets your daily struggle justo to be around them, nobody gets how hard it is for you to do things. It doesn't matter how hard you try to tell them through your own ways.

It is likely that no one will ever help you. No one will ever come to you when you're isolated and dissociating to say ""hey are you okay?"". No one will remind you to eat or to clean your room. 

And you know this. Other people just ignore us and leave us behind, rotting. They may say they care about you, but they turn their backs during a breakdown or an episode. They say that it's not fair with them, they say it's crazy, they say you're overreacting, they say it's scary, or they simply ignore you and vanish, leaving you alone and careless, at risk."
370,I cant do this anymore but I'm too afraid to end it,"My friends have all been pulling away from me lately. I've been feeling so unbelievably alone and insecure and I've already started considering different ways to off myself and then my sister got me high last night and started a fight with me that lasted for thirty minutes until I broke down and had an anxiety attack, which the few friends who still hang around just. Seemed incredibly annoyed by when I reached out. 

I went to bed and I still feel empty and broken now that I'm up again. Nobody messaged me last night. Nobody cares, and everyone would be happier if I'd never been born. 

I wish I'd fucking die in my sleep. I wish someone would mug me so I could just tell them to end it for me. I'm so tired. I'm so alone. I'm a burden on everyone."
371,It's crazy how difficult it is just to receive a crumb of sympathy or support.,"I have found that posting to these mental health subreddits has been the most reliable way to have my spirits lifted during tough times but even then, the bulk of my posts get ignored. I know this post shares that same fate so god knows why I'm wasting my time here.

Every single time I reach out to a therapist or someone close to me, you could say that an imaginary door slams shut in my face. Therapists don't want anything to do with me due to my unapologetic honesty about the suicidal feelings that torment me and frankly, I'm not the biggest fan of them either these days. The last time I attempted to enrol in therapy, in pure desperation, my therapist wasted zero time in nipping our sessions in the bud and informed me that she would not be able to provide her service after I committed the crime of uttering that big, bad ""S"" word. When it comes to seeking comfort from those close to me, my sole friend who could not be more useless at cheering me up if he tried is my best option. He has mocked my pain in the past. As close as we are, I genuinely wonder if he would feel a modicum of sadness if I killed myself.

I'm not asking for much. Just a few kind sentences would mean the world to me. ""I'm so sorry that you're suffering right now. I hope that things will look up for you in the near future.""

Just... nobody wants to hear a *lick* of my inner feelings. For my entire life, I bottled them up and now that I'm finally beginning to open up about them, I'm realising what horseshit the ""reach out to someone!!!!11"" advice is. I seriously regret it.

Anyone else relate?"
372,Not sure what to do,"My family blame myself only for my unhappiness and I want to leave them because of their lack of love now I’m alone and isolated.

I have anxiety disorder and I’m single and 27, which makes me really unhappy but I’m never allowed to have self pity because apparently all I do is act in a selfish self pitying way. My dads reaction is constantly “oh cry me a river”. They have no compassion which I’ve told them but they couldn’t care less. I hate myself and them I already am on medication for depression, I can not catch a break from the pain I experience and I am so lonely."
373,Personifying my depression/toxic traits?,"I'm just wondering if anyone else has done this. I created a character that is basically the embodiment of all my depressive, suicidal, toxic, mean thoughts. Her name is Sayton (there's a whole story behind that name I won't go into lol) Her whole gimmick is that she is totally made out of straight up venom that she can control the potency of and shapeshift. I find it to be a kind of coping mechanism actually. I've started to sort of imagine that it's her talking at me whenever I start having a depressive episode or negative thoughts and it makes it so much easier to shut it up sometimes. She also is kind of a source of my dark humor. 

Just wondering if anyone else has made up a personification of their depression of a coping mechanism, or is it just me being a miserable artist 😅😅"
374,I don’t want to be here anymore,"I’ve lost so much over the past few months. My friends told me they don’t want me hanging around them anymore, and they just constantly bully me now. I want to end it, but I’m afraid of hurting my family because of it. I take unnecessary risks and do dangerous and stupid things a lot of the time honestly because I just hope that one time it really does kill me. I feel like there’s this huge weight on my chest just crushing me all the time, and all I want is to be gone."
375,Not a single soul values me and it makes me hurt so much i just want to cry but i cant,
376,My parents don't care,"Hey. I don't usually post much but I'm 16 and I truly believe I've been depressed for years. My boyfriend has been encouraging me to seek help since he sees how big of an issue this all is... I never took much thought to it but I decided to ask my parents if I could go get tested for depression.

My mother and 11 year old brother have already been diagnosed with depression and take medication accordingly but when I asked if I could see if I could get help they laughed at me and told me that I shouldn't try to fake depression for attention.

I tried multiple times, my mother and father both saying it's just a phase.

I never wanted help but my partner showed me that there is a way that I could be happier and I want to experience the energy and passion he does....

I have no idea what to do, this story has just repeat itself for 6 or so years. I can't go to a doctor since I have to be accompanied by a guardian... What do I do...

Thank you for taking the time to read this"
377,i did a good thing today,"i spent today doing a deep cleanse. i hung up all of my clean clothes and put two loads of dirty washing on. i re-arranged my room and tidied it all up as well as vacuumed and dusted everything. i put my bed sheets in the wash so it would be clean tonight and got out new PJs to sleep in tonight. 

I also had a shower where i spent 10 minutes just scrubbing myself super clean (i didn’t realise how unclean i was) and deeply washing my hair. (i also just realised i didn’t feel dysphoric throughout so that’s pretty cool). i cleaned my teeth for 4 minutes and washed my face."
378,"i have distorted perceptions of my family, friends and strangers","this hasn't been the first time i've experienced this, but something might've triggered it. Awhile ago, my dad and I were talking about my depression and how I expressed I wanted things the way it was before Christmas or at least before the year ends, I told him I was willing to do anything just to have my source of happiness back or get rid of my depression somehow. Then, he told me how friendship always ends and family is always there in the end. That gave my mind an idea that people all around me, including friends; don't exist at all and I created them so I could find comfort in what  I'm going through right now. Maybe because I feel like all of my real life friends don't care about me anymore and just watch me go through daily life feeling all sorts of pain, they just watch my rants in our groupchats and say nothing. I feel like they're not there and I'm loosing touch with them, I'm scared of losing them and being alone. I lost so much and I want to have it back."
380,This has been Said here many times,"About how you can’t kill your self because of how it would ruin your mom and I’m in the same boat. Only thing is I’m a 30 yr male living with his parents with no real end in sight given my past mistakes. My mom also, though never diagnosed, has major obsessive compulsive disorder which greatly exacerbates things at home. I’m no where close to being able to move out due to sizable debt. I’ve reverted to heavy drug use and gambling in order to escape, which only snowballs everything. (Longtime drug user, went sober for about 3 years at one point- nothing changed mentally). I’ve given up hobbies and social activities. I feel trapped and I say to myself I wish I were dead no joke several times every hour. I love my mom more than anything... and I really hope I can keep going"
381,Last day,i’ve thought about it and i have my whole day planned today. I’m 15 ik im young but this depression shit is hard i love you guys and i will miss my family and ik they would be devasted but i’m tired of this pain
382,sdasdasdassda,"My parents left me young; mother abandoned me,  at work, father split, mother was intemperate, often threatened to beat me, to send me back to fahter cunt; motherwhore was, of course, a terrible parent: she was cold and distant: often simply away, leaving me small and scared with strange relatives; she was often self-centered, sighing and stern in feature, scared me, small and scared; ignored my problems and grievences at whim if they didn't suit her outlook on me: i was simple an extention of her: some fucking pet to amuse her, when the whore came home from work, often left with granny; forced into the religion, screamed at in the lot of a cemetery when I said i didn't believe; and years of shaime and pain and denial and i just cant and oh fuck ne fuck it all"
383,Tired of living every single day.,"This my first time doing something like this I've never shared something like this to my friends, family, or even my twin brother. Why is it that i'm so useless. I'm so stupid at college I can't even do what I have to do. My classmates don't even expect anything from me when group with them. I feel like im wasting our parents money. All I do is fail. Honestly I just want everything to end. I'm so bad at everything, all I do is play games, watch anime/kpop to keep me from being bored. While all my hs classmates already made a achievement, landed a job, have a partner. Im just so useless at everything it honestly breaks my heart. My parents always remind me of being a failure and to get my shit together but I don't even know where to start. I can't even land a job even if I wanted one. I'm so skinny that even other people laugh about it. College isn't even fun anymore, at first I was enjoying it. But now, waking up 4am to ride the train overloaded with people is just too hard for me. I'm just so sad, for 19 years I've never experienced something like this. 

I apologize for being confusing its just that its my first time doing something like this, I couldnt hold back my tears."
384,After being happy comes the great depression,"It sucks. Always when I'm in a good mood and can laugh with people as soon as this is over I'm terrible sad, exhausted and lonely. Not just exhausted but really really tired. I could sleep immidiately. Should it not be different?"
385,i’m in so much pain all the time,i wish i were dead. i’m in so much pain all the fucking time and all i wanna do is stab myself until i cant feel anything anymore. i’m tired of everything. i’m tired of myself. i’m tired of fucking being alive i just wanna fucking die. please just let me die.
386,Depression killed my old me,"So hey I've been experiencing since I am 11 years old and it just got worse and worse. I am older now and feeling more uncomfortable with who I am. I've turned from a normal Boy who plays some games and studied for school to a Boy who turned into a most of the time emotionless, depressed and into a kind of psychopath. 
It began in December in the year I've gotten 11 my grandma died and my parents told me about it in a childish way. I didn't understand it so I thought she will come back someday. The next days I felt more sad and weirder then normally and I just ignored it. The next year my grandpa died and at that time I knew what death was. It shocked me and made my depression start. The next months after the two deaths I didn't know what will happen to me someday I just thought about ""Are they really gone?"" ""Did something happen to them but mum and dad want to hide it?"" And so on I was just confused with all of this since I was young. Skipping till now 2019 December 18th. I've experienced panic attacks and anxiety attacks recently, I had 9 deaths in my Life that were in my family, some girlfriend I had and normal friends. I try to talk with my online friends in a nice and open way. I call it that I talk with my Mask on so they won't see my true identity. 
Sorry if there are some grammar mistakes I'm from Germany so yeah I'm not the best in English."
387,Depression can't be cured with sport,"Depression and physical activity lays on different layers. Ok, you can go to gym, but you will still be depressed. Sometimes running or gym helps a little bit, but only if you get therapy and antidepressants."
388,Feeling unlovable,"I have a small family and I know they love me, but they rarely show it, especially my brother, he doesn't appreciate me at all, he's rude no matter how much I try.

I don't feel like my friends are really my friends because I can't open up to them, it's my own walls Ive built.

I have feelings for somebody who doesn't care for me, and no matter how often I tell myself I should stop seeing them, I initiate it Everytime and sleep with them and feel unworthy of love and unlovable because they don't love me, but the small moments of validation and affection they give me feel like they're worth it.
I feel so sad that I can't find the self worth in me and love myself more so that I don't need to do things like this and let people have control over my feelings. No matter how awful I feel from his cold remarks, if he tells me to go see him, I'd be running to him regardless of my the important things I have to do. Sometimes I don't even feel like having sex, I just feel like I want someone to hold me, to have intimacy with somebody.
I never thought I'd be in this situation where I'm becoming convinced something's defected in me and noone would want me for me."
389,I FINALLY got a place for therapy!,"I've been trying to get help since February. At the beginning of July, I was at the local psychiatric hospital twice for diagnostic consultation. Since then, I've been on a waitlist. The hospital just called me and told that I can start therapy in January! I'm so fucking relieved. First ray of hope in a long time."
390,Adding another med...,"Maxed out the Effexor. 
Found the max dose of Seroquel I can manage. 
Let’s throw in some Wellbutrin next. 

Honestly curious if my brain could ever function without meds at this point. Not willing to find out, but really curious."
391,Feeling numb might be better than feeling this sad.,"Sometimes I feel absolutely nothing. Just numb and empty. 

But other times, like now, I feel so crushingly sad and heartbroken. Almost suffocatingly so. 

I don’t even know which I prefer more. I’ve just been going back and forth between those two states for... pretty much years now. When I feel one, I miss the other. And right now I miss feeling numb. I don’t want it to hurt this much. 

Make the pain stop, someone, please."
392,Why can’t I just be normal and go to work???,"I’ve (28F) been working a full time job 7:30-4 five days a week for about 2 months now. Before this I drove for Uber because I can never hold down a real job but it wasn’t paying the bills. I can’t ever get myself to get out of bed in the morning no matter what time I go to sleep and I feel like a lazy piece of shit. I’m always tired and cranky when I get out of work and yell at my boyfriend because I’m miserable at this job. And the job isn’t even hard, I don’t know why I can’t just go and do it every day with no problem like everyone else. Right now I’m sitting in a parking lot drinking a coffee because I told my boss I was coming in late due to car troubles but I’m really just so drained. Why can’t I just be normal? I need this job and I’ve called off 3 times in the past 2 months and I’ve been at least 5 minutes late every day, a few times 30 or an hour. If they fire me I’ll be screwed but I’m so lethargic and feel like shit every day. Any tips to get through an 8.5 hour work day without wanting to die, or getting out of bed on time?"
393,A goodbye,"I knew when I was in trouble when I didn’t even feel like studying for my finals. The things that I cared so much for didn’t even phase me. 

I Can’t do this anymore. I feel like this entire thing isn’t for me. 

I love you. Don’t ever think otherwise. I have lots of problems that I need to tackle. 

I’m sorry to have to put you through this. Although, I am hardly around for some. So I figured that it won’t be much of an issue. This isn’t fair to you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry I made such a selfish decision. I love you all 




This is for all of my friends and family that I neglected to see for so long."
394,Sad songs,"What's ur go to sad song artist? Whenever ur feeling low, or just always listening because they understand. Rn my ones are Witt lowry and NF (which have always been my go to's throughout all my different phases). Previously and still occasionally I'll listen to emo rap which some times falls into mumble rap (I know how terrible of a person am I, listening to mumble rap 🤮).

Tell me yours!"
395,Does anybody know painless way die?,
396,At this rate I will end up killing myself,"I am 17 and I have been fighting depression and anxiety for a few years . 

Since beginning of this school-year I have been feeling worse and worse every week . I started therapy it is helping a little bit , but not enough . I started with self-harm , because it relieved the stress , however , now I am left with long scars on my arms and afraid to go out without long sleeves . 

My therapist suggested  going on meds, but my mum is against . I don't have the guts to kill myself yet , but I feel that a few weeks , or months will pass and I am gone ."
397,I’m gonna miss out on everything good,"High school freshman here. I keep hearing about my online friends awesome childhoods. They all grew up with really awesome and compassionate friends and they always have really awesome memorable stories to tell. Not to mention they had awesome grades, sex lives and whatever. I wish I could have what they have but I’m really lonely, not to mention failing school. The idea of missing out on having a bunch of really cool friends and going on cool adventures with them is really painful to me. Not to mention they’re all so much smarter then me and I’m incredibly simple minded and I can’t help but despise myself for it. The idea of having these next four years being completely alone hurts me so much and I hate it. I wish I could escape and start over my life with different and better people. But I’m stuck in this hell hole of a town. No matter how hard I try this world never gives me what I desire. I wish I could get some cigarettes or alcohol to just forget about this hell."
398,Any one else has problems with their sexuality?,"I was raised strictly Christian. Growing up I was told that people like me deserve to rot in hell. I don't believe any more, but some of this stuff sticks with me. I like guys, I really really like guys, I've dated guys and slept with guys. It just feels natural, but o can't stop hating myself for doing it. To add more fuel to the fire, I don't feel comfortable as a guy, I want to transition. I just my body so much, and 8 hate myself for hating my body. If all of this thoughts could just stop. If only I could be normal. I don't belive any more, but there's always a part of me that's scared of going to hell for being a fag. My head is just a mess, I really don't feel any anger or hatred against any one else that's queer, just me If you made it this far, thanks."
399,I wish my suicide was successful 5 years ago,"5 Years ago I attempted suicide, after some time and thinking I thought everything would be alright. But I'm back to where I was again, I hate myself so much for being a useless piece of shit. All I want is to die, but I don't want to hurt my parents and brothers, so I am stuck being miserable for days, weeks, and months. Why does it have to be this way, why can't they let me die in peace, I just want to get away from here, away from everything and everyone. Whats the point of any of this"
400,Am I the only one that gets depressed more going to church?,"I used to enjoy going to church, I would get spiritual fulfillment, a sense of community and belonging. But after years of dealing with people and the world, I usually saddened after a service. I don't see any meaning from sermons and it seems to be a lip service especially from people that don't seem to be sincere or have a sense of community and fellowship other than a few hours on Sundays? What are your thoughts, or is it just me?"
401,I’m sick of fighting,"What kills me is that I’m pretty sure my girlfriend is no longer interested in me.  
And on top of that she’s depressed, I’m depressed... almost to the point that I actually really want to die. I feel like I hav nothing more to lose. I think I want to just do it and get it done and over with. 

Those who would possibly have a hard time with my loss would not be sad for so long. I’m hardly around anyways. It’s would be like nothing changed. 

I fucking want to die"
402,How do people deal with loved ones who are depressed?,"How do people with depressed loved ones deal with them when they have a hard time seeing the truth? If they are so down a hole they can't see that you love them. They are working on getting clinical help for the depression but having a tough time and seem to be pushing their loved ones away. Any tips for how to approach them? I'm thinking about writing a letter, but anything day to day to say or do?"
403,I’m convinced that I’m not going to get better,I’m in such a bad place right now and it’s hard for me to put it into words.
404,Living with my divorced parents,"Long story short, from what I can make out; my mother and father having hoarding problems and my father's in denial about his hoarding problem. And he initiates arguments and my mother tries to match him, which leads to things getting out of hand. They are like fire and gasoline. It's never gotten physical, but, they shout at each other. Sometimes it ends in tears. And I'm always stuck in the middle. Even when I'm upstairs they're downstairs I can hear them. I laugh at it. I need to in order to not bawl my eyes out."
405,Do I have depression or am I cured of it?,"Hi people! About 6 months ago, I took antidepressant Escitalopram for one month. I stopped taking it after one month because it was giving me terrible side effects. Now, I have doubts over whether I have depression or not.

I am unable to take interest in anything. I lost my interests and hobbies. I have trouble concentrating/focusing on things such as reading something, watching movies, and listening to people. I have trouble forming thoughts and putting thoughts to sentences. I am finding it difficult to make decisions. I have trouble remembering, e.g. I don't remember what I did yesterday, the past several days, or the previous week. I am sleeping more, i.e. 12 or 13 hours. I am getting suicidal thoughts especially at night. My sex drive has decreased a lot. I am also having some other sexual dysfunctions.

I have no other symptoms of depression. So, do I still have depression or am I cured of it by taking antidepressant for only one month?"
406,Everyone has done more this year than I have.,"everyone has done so much this year and accomplished more than i have. nothing will take away or distract me from how much of a fucking failure i am, and how much i’m less of myself and doing less and being less and breathing less and existing less every year. seriously when will this end? i’m deteriorating, i’m burning out, every year gets worse than the last and i’ve given up trying because i don’t think im worth it and i think i’m a mistake and all of this was never meant to be. i’m not supposed to be breathing or existing and i’m a waste im a fucking waste of space and i can’t handle being so less than anymore. i cannot stand seeing myself never reaching my potential i cannot stand seeing everyone move forward. i don’t want to be that jealous bitch but i know i am. everyone around me is happy and even if they’re not, they will be eventually but i don’t know about me. i believe in them and that they have a good ending to their story but i genuinely believe i’m not meant for that. Fuck, man. what do I do"
407,Frustrated with everything therefore can't do anything,"Video games are a good example. I start playing Antichamber, it's a nice fun game until you are too stupid for the next puzzle, I want to play Starbound and I get killed immediately with no way to recover right from the start, I want to play Firewatch and get stuck on stupid one way trails after just an hour of playtime or so.

Normal people would see these things as challenges and be happy about it, I just want to enjoy a nice a game and my stupidity makes me wanna die."
408,"It’s probably just me, but isn’t Christmas the worst","People just live to throw shade at depressed people like Ugandan stones at gay people, they’re all just like “Christmas is the ‘happiest time of the year’, how can you be sad”. I just feel belittled, they somehow found a way to make me feel more worthless, so I guess hooray for them. I’m probably alone in this, like I am in life. I probably don’t fit in here, why am I even trying? I’m sorry for wasting your time with my worthless opinions."
409,"My coworkers hate me, but they don't know I hate myself even more","I started working part-time at a bakery a couple months ago, around 20hrs/week, most of my coworkers have been there for over a year, and I'm the ""new kid"" who fucks up so they hate me because I make them slower. I always catch them gossiping about me and complaining how I'm slow and take more time to do stuff/make mistakes. 

I fucking feel terrible all the time at work and just expecting myself to fuck up, being anxious, fucking up and then they complain and I expect them to. I dread going to work because of this. I don't have experience in the job but I know I wouldn't stay long. I don't know how to get better. I'm just stupid. They work everyday so they're familiar with the routine, I'm not. I work irregularly  and on an irregular schedule and hours. I don't know what to do except trying my best, and I do, but it's not enough."
410,I hate everything and I hate myself even more.,"I used to find peace in knowing this. I used to find cathartic sublimation in it. Now I dunno. I just feel tired and angry. I feel suicidal every single day, without fault, and extremely angry at the smallest things at the same time.

I don't even want to eat anymore. I have no sex drive. There's nothing that brings me fun or joy anymore. I only find solace and temporary respite when I imagine how I could kill myself. Death. Freedom. Nothing. Feeling nothing. Being nothing. Really far away from this rotten world."
411,Mood swings suck.,"On mobile so sorry if typos or formatting is weird.


I've been having some really major mood swings and I can't seem to stop them. In less than an hour, I went from crying, feeling worthless and Thinking of ending it right then to feeling positive and smiling at everyone. It doesn't make sense. I don't get it. 

I don't know how to beat this. Maybe I'm off my meds but I'm at work and just wanted to feel less alone."
412,I just want someone to hug me and give me affection,I'm so lonely and wish anyone would ask me how was my day and tell me that it's going to be alright. I feel so desperate to feel loved by anyone. I hate feeling lonely.
413,Off my antidepressants but wish I was back on them because feeling numb is better than feeling like this.,"The main reason I wanted to come off my antidepressants was because I was feeling emotionally numb. I've been off them for a while and have since met a guy I've fallen hard for. I don't think the feelings are mutual and now I just feel worthless, unwanted and all that negative shit. Life was easier when I felt nothing for no one."
414,I keep alternating between suicidal sadness and extreme anger.,"It's so draining. Some days I feel like killing myself. Then for the next few days I'm thinking about killing everyone that barely talks to me. The sadness overwhelms me. The anger consumes me. I'm tired of being such a mess. 

Sometimes people tell me that being depressed means being numb to everything and feeling nothing. I wish that was the case for me. I wish I could feel absolutely nothing. No sadness. No anger. No regrets. No pain.

No, actually, I just wish I could be absolutely fucking dead."
415,I'm sleepwalking into disaster.,"Deadlines are bearing down and I do nothing but worry about them and hate myself for not doing anything. I'm paralysed.

But I know I'm not paralysed and it's just my own inertia I need to overcome. All I have to do is actually do it. And now that it's either too late or almost too late it's even worse."
416,My husband told me he wants to kill himself,"My husband wants to kills himself. He has been depressed for approx 2 years. He's a very stoic man and never admited it or sought help. Until about 8weeks ago.  He is 27.

He hates his job. He works quite a bit of overtime. Every day is 12 hours of doing stuff he hates. He Earns $100,000 a year. He's burnt out and doesn't feel like he can sustain it. He wants more money with little prospects to have this come to fruition. 

We have fertility issues. We have had numerous failed IVF attempts. This is emotionally and financially draining. We've spent $30,000 already. He blames himself.

We have been building our house for the last 2.5 years. Our overheads are huge! Paying rent and a mortgage and IVF and progress payments. He feels like he's drowning. I earn $75,000 per year.

He is on medication. And has an apt to see a psychologist in Jan. Medication doesn't seem to have fixed anything. He's been on them for approx 6 weeks. He is working with his GP to find what's right for him. 

People with depression are so incredibly selfish. **Not their fault obviously! but it is sooo self indulgent. Everything is about the person who's depressed. everything they aren't, everything they wish they were, everything they don't have. 

He drinks and gets drunk everyday. He's been doing that for about 9-12 months. There isn't a single day he doesn't drink. Mixing meds and alcohol now. He's put on a little weight and he is always so flat in his affect. After years of being around this, I'm exhausted. 

I don't know how to help him! When he tells me he wishes he could vanish, it so deeply sad. I couldn't imagine that reality. Everyday."
417,So overwhelmed I don’t want to carry on anymore,"Ive never really had a stable home. As a kid i switched between living with my parents and living with my grandparents every other year because my parents didn’t know how to handle me. During high school I was forced to live with my parents again because my grandpa got I’ll and they weren’t able to take care of me anymore. Because living with my parents got so bad they kicked me out I ended up moving in with my emotional abusive boyfriend at the time. When I finally got the courage to leave him I moved back to my parents, which only lasted a few months. Then I got my own place in a dirty old schoolbuilding, but it was cheap and the only thing I could afford on student loans. The building got a new owner and a new purpose so me and my housemates got kicked out. I found yet another place to live but my student loans are being lowered by the government so soon I won’t be able to afford that place anymore. I have no other options left and I don’t know what to do now. Meanwhile I’m dealing with severe depression and anxiety disorder for over 7 years while also being in college so I can’t take a full time job to cover the expenses. And my current part time job can never cover it. People keep telling me that things will get better and stuff, but after all this time it’s only getting more and more difficult so I can’t believe them. I’m currently in my 5th careplan in therapy so it’s not that I’m not trying my ass off to get better. Life keeps throwing shit at me and i can’t keep fighting any longer than I have"
418,I've felt that my depression is back and feel like killing myself again due to a series of events and I don't know what to do.,"I go to therapy but its not really for my depression, its for my introversion, so I dont know how to bring it up.


I've felt like this in the past, but this time I've made a plan, and its entirely doable. 


This coming Christmas I'm going to be alone for about a week and I think that is when I'll most likely do it, I really felt like doing it yesterday, but
It was my little brothers birthday and I dont want the anniversary of my death to ruin it(though I doubt they'd care), and plan on doing it a little after Christmas(so I dont ruin that either).


I basically dont have any real friends anymore.


The person who I thought genuinely cared about me, doesn't. 


My mom's side of the family pretty much cut me out and forgot about me.


And I'm not sure about my career pathway anymore."
419,So tired of being sad all the time,I hope one day I'll look back on this as a happier person who's life is finally together.
420,I haven’t eaten properly in three weeks! Advice please,"I’m (21F) and I first noticed it about three weeks ago, I can physically feel that I’m hungry but I when I try to eat I have a bite or two and just feel defeated. My boyfriend is starting to worry but I feel worse when I force myself to eat. I suffered badly when I was about 5+ and could go a whole day with no food. I am almost positive that it is stress related and I’ve usually been able to deal with this by just eating little but often, however it’s been almost a month and I’ve lost a stone and it doesn’t seem to be going away. I was wondering if anyone knows any tips or tricks into getting my appetite back or even dealing with anxiety and stress in a better way."
422,There's hope (in the most bizarre places),"I just wanted to share this with you.

I am suffering all my life with anxiety, depression and OCD. I am on medication. I see a psychiatrist and a therapist every week for the last two decades.

Yesterday I was struggling to attend my kid's xmas party at school. I was sitting on a bench outside the school freaking out, feeling sorry for my self, wondering if I ever going to be able to live a normal life.

Everyone looked happy and relaxed. Well dressed and smiling. The school was full of xmas decorations. And I was sitting there like the world was going to end.

""I have a great job, a great family, the bad days are in the past. What the fuck is wrong with me?""

Then I heard this song playing and suddenly I felt like everything was flowing through me... It wasn't mindfulness or acceptance. It was a ""flow"".

I stood up, went inside and I enjoyed my son's performance with laughter and joy.

Sometimes (no matter how rare) it just takes a song...

And this brings me hope.

Hang in there.

423,"Reddit, I fucked up","Where to start...

I lost my wife last year and have been dealing with it badly, and not processing anything properly. I recently reached out via a particular r4r subreddit and made a connection with someone only to realise that I wasn't ready to move on from/with my grief.

The particular redditor has asked today that we don't speak anymore as they are struggling with ""just friends"" and of course I understand, I don't want to cause any pain to anyone.

I feel so selfish to have dragged someone else into my grief, and misrepresented my intentions, to only end up causing pain to others.

To top it all, my wife passed one year ago today.

Not expecting redemption/responses. Just baring my soul"
424,Running out of time. PLS HELP,"Hi. So this is my first post. If anyone is reading this I would appreciate your response. I am a 24 yr old British Indian from London and I have been suffering from depression for about 6 years, basically I feel suicidal and everyday I'm finding it hard to carry on I have been to therapists in the past and I am on medication. Ik this is the generic feeling for ppl like me but let me tell you why I feel trapped. I just feel my life heading towards more unhappiness, basically  I am single and as I am Indian there is lot pressure for me to find someone and get married within the next few years, and whilst that would be nice, there is also the fact that time is against me. I have spoken to a few girls but never had a girlfriend. And most ppl that I DM on Instagram are rude and others just simply aren't interested. Im not sure what to do as nobody wants me. I did speak to a girl for a few months and then she just decided she doesn't like me anymore when I didn't even do anything. Idk it's hard to explain my pain. But I just want to love someone but these girls are either horrible or just don't reply. Another part of my life is my career. I work in the family business but I don't like it one bit, my goal and dream is to be an actor/writer and I am trying to work towards this as I go to a good part time acting school. My parents let me do this however they said if I don't get onto the agency or nothing happens within the next year then o have to stop and work at the family business. I have all these ideas for scripts and have such an ambition for film but I'm afraid I might not be able to become something within the next year. So these two aspects of my life are making my depression worse and making me scared. I just want to be with someone who I can love and I am trying my hardest to become and actor. I pray to God every single day to help me with these things and to bring me happiness but I feel everyday is the same. I'm trying the best I can to make things happen for me. That's why I'm here. Maybe someone can help me?? Sorry for the long message. Not sure if I have explained myself fully. If anyone has got this far then thanks for your time. Please help if you can. Thank you and merry Christmas."
425,Its 5:13CST. and I'm hi. I'm going to be at work at 7:30,Batteling depression and anxiety. Playing r/baduk helps get my mind of things.
426,I fucking hate living,"I fucking hate everyone in my life so much.
The only good thing in this world is my son.
People always let me down, they always hurt me.
Tomorrow's my birthday and i dont even want to celebrate it."
427,Everyone leaves in the end,"In the end we are all alone,

Everything ends,

The cost of your life outweighs the good it can do,

In the end they all leave

Nothing will change that,

People just dont care,

Nothing will change that,

You arent special

Nothing will change that,

Life is as much a gift as it is a curse,

Time is a gift you cant return,

You won't get a refund on your wasted hours,

Feelings aren't a certainty,

The natural state of things is never good,

They say you arent alone,

They say it will get better,

They say life is worth it,

Yet they all leave when you need them most,

Yet it never gets better for long,

Yet all life does is bring you down,

Is it all an intricate joke?

Is it all fake?

I feel so fucking alone, 

Everyone leaves in the end."
428,Dumb little fantasy,"Long story short , I've been fantasying about death ever since I've been 15. Was bullied , been to shrinks , dropped out of school at 22 and couldn't get my head in the right place ever since.

29 now , unemployed , no car , no real diploma , no future and still romanticizing about my own death. The empty feeling in the pitt of my stomach always there to remind me every morning that i failed my parents and it feels like natural selection is catching up to me.  

Recently however , whether due to lack of sunlight , vitamin deficiency or downright insanity but I've been getting this sense that if i were to use my suicidal predilections by helping others like joining the firefighters for example , if i were to die in the line of work while trying to help others i could die with a clear conscious. It sounds silly having written it down and looking at it in hindsight i doubt they would even take me as a volunteer. I feel silly for sharing this , usually introverted and never used social network in my life. Anyway , just wanted to share my selfish egoistical and narcissistic delusions on the internet for all to see , it's not like it'll come back to bite me in the ass."
429,No one really listens,I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for technically 2 years. I have been left almost every other week. I really don’t know if it’s due to me being a terrible partner or that she isn’t the most stable herself. I’ve been trying to give signs of needing help to her for months and it feels like she doesn’t listen and if she does it’s only for a moment. We have broken up again and continued the block cycle because she will ghost and ignore me for days and sometimes weeks. The longest was 4 months and she got married during that time and came back. I’ve been at the worst I’ve been this last few weeks and let her know and on one occasion she was there for me but not 3 days later she had broken up with me again because she couldn’t handle how I was reacting to things. I’ve been trying to tell her this for the last few days but she doesn’t care to listen no matter what I tell her. I hate my life I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’ve never felt this bad like this before or for this long and she’s only ever been the person to make it worse every time and I still find myself loving her. I really don’t want to be here I’m miserable and I just wanted her of all people to listen but nobody does
430,How many other people go to sleep wishing they'll die peacefully before they wake up?,"I read this a lot here, ""I don't want to kill myself, I just wish I didn't exist"". I identify with that...  so much. I just don't want to keep feeling like this anymore, and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as I'm trying to sleep (e.g. right now). All I want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. Is that so much to ask for?"
431,Not being able to talk to someone is killing me.,"I feel exhausted and dont know whom can i approach. The best solution in such cases is to be able to talk but i feel like something is holding me back. its like the sadder i get, i have these moments where i really want to cry my heart out and just need a hug, and sometimes i just feel so dead i would totally kill myself if I had the means to do it. i dont have good enough friends who would notice that something is wrong with me because i dont text/meet them often, and i am too anxious to ask anyone for help. Ive been trying to get in touch with my therapist via phonecall as i am out of town for work  but she isnt responding to my messages. work was very stressful last week and although its better this week im too upset to think straight. i havent gone home in about a month now and work even takes over my weekends. i only have one coworker here on this project and i really dont think he would care about why i am so stressed out. i just got out of a long term relationship a few months ago and  my ex and his mother wont stop contacting me, he goes on and on about how i wont talk to him often. im tired of receiving texts from him asking me to consider getting back together, so i blocked him, his mother calls me up and says she's worried he's suicidal because he cant move on from our relationship. she asks me to contact him, im tired to explaining to her that i really cannot do anything and i really just want to be left alone. Finally when i have some free time from work i feel guilty about the whole exchange as i still think my ex was a good friend, just not a good boyfriend. i  try to talk to him to sort things out and then he decides to ignore me. I've tried talking to my parents and although they're very supportive and caring people even their hands are tied and they're just asking me to stick around and not get overwhelmed by terrible anxiety. Sometimes I feel like I am not able to convey the seriousness of what I'm feeling effectively, I feel like sometimes they just think it's a phase I go through when I'm very upset and then I'm fine the other times. 

 i dont know if im unnecessarily stressing but i really feel suicidal. i hate this feeling of being isolated, having work pressure, a psycho ex boyfriend, and a family so loving that you feel bad for being such a failure in existence. i really just want to talk to someone and i really need a hug but i feel so trapped and in pain,  i want to kill myself and feel like i am at the end of my rope but im too scared to do it. I'm scared of failing this suicide attempt, and im scared to think about the repurcussions. i dont want to upset my parents,  i dont want unnecessary questions i will have to answer if i fail a suicide attempt, and honestly i hope i dont freak out while attempting to kill myself. I'm sorry if i dont sound coherent here but right now i just want to sleep and never wake up. its hard trying to show people around me that everything is fine."
432,I wish things were different,I feel so depressed. I don't have friends. I live in a terrible house with a verbally abusive stepdad. I started drinking a lot too to make myself feel numb and bit remember. One main things that depresses me is that I am attracted to the same sex. My Church teaches this is shameful. I feel so ashamed and depressed because I have same sex attractions. I've thought about ending my life multiple times this week. I don't know what to do. I'm just a waste of space no one cares about.
433,I hope i die in my sleep tonight,"I'm about to sleep, really i hope i don't wake up"
434,It's my birthday today and i only got one message from a guy that studied with me 5 years ago,"This won't be a ""omg i'm so alone post"". Nothing wrong with that, depression sucks, i just wanted to acknowledge how difficult this guy life has been and how he managed to stay positive all the time. I mean, he's a fucking hero. I won't say too many details but let's say that this guy has  **BIG** goal in his life that it's to study in a hard as fuck uni and has been struggling with it for the past 5 years...While most of his friends are almost/already graduating...

Idk if i would be able to stay positive like that, he's such a good friend tho. Maybe that's a sign that i should talk more to him? Yeah definitely, dude deserves it and seems to be lonely most of his time idk.

T.;Dr: Just wanted to tell a little about a guy i know that is positive all the time and this bugs me lol."
435,"I dont know if this is allowed, but omg I just really want to die","I feel like the headline pretty much sums it up

I just cant deal with Shit anymore
I dont want to be around when more bad Shit happens
Im just so tired of everything 
I cant stay happy and I only feel like a burden

But I dont know how to kill myself without burdening people with the aftermath as well. 
And I dont know how I could do it to my boyfriend, especially since he lost his dad last christmas. 
Should I break up with him before I do it and «ghost» so it takes a while for him to find out?

(Btw sorry for half assed english, Not my first language )"
436,"Even with obtaining money, love, or success, life still feels pointless and boring","I’m just having such a hard time with the realities of our limited ways. There’s really only so much you can do on earth as a human, and most of it is just BORING. 

There simply isn’t enough in this life to feel... fulfilling. I’ve reached goals, loved people, done good things, but it all just comes back to nothing in the end. I just feel like I’m filling holes that will always leak."
437,No Joy,"I grew up in a dysfunctional household, I was a only child, a lot of people do, some far worse than my experience. But it makes you strange and weird to other children which more often than not, follows you all during your school years. As a young adult I thought I overcame the dysfunction, built a very successful sports bar business that thrived over 20 years. I never married and had no children, I loved life and had a great time. Many of my employees worked for me over 10, even 15 years, I thought of them as family, bonuses, good pay, and helping with small problems when I could. Very bad investments brought it all down. Full bankruptcy. That was 8 years ago. I asked business contacts from the past to help me find a new career path, none followed up, no interview gave me a call back, I seemed to be a embarrassment to the people I felt close to, I was treated like a unwanted house guest. I moved out of state to start a new life and thought I found it but current events have made me feel like a failure all over again. The details are not important. What plays on my mind is how hopeless any kind of reconciliation seems to be. I go to bars, or other social gatherings, like a time machine, hoping I will feel like I once did, but I feel ignored and treated like just an old fool. I do see people worse off than me, it saddens me, to the point I can hardly look at them. I cannot find joy anymore, and it scares me. Every day was full of joy at one time. I'm scared because I know in my heart that one day I will kill myself, Maybe 3 months, 3 years, or 20 years, when I truly don't even have a fantasy to look forward to...I blame nobody for this, If there is a God, no matter what scorn he may have for me, I will thank him for the opportunity that I had to have a full and happy life. Me and me alone are at fault for everything...But I have one wish, I truly have nothing coming, but I would love to live my life again knowing what I know now, just to prove to myself how wonderful life could be without all the poor decisions of my life."
438,Having a mild depression relapse and I feel like I can't talk to my parents,"I stopped therapy coz I was doing well then I have sudden fallen back. I feel like I can't talk to my parents as my brother is bad with his depression and they're having to deal with him and they're exhausted.

I'm worried my anti depressants aren't working anymore.

I feel like I can't talk to anyone close as they're metaphorically smacking me in the face saying ""stop"". I'm trying to get over my relationship ending, I'm trying to improve myself and try but I'm just so tired.

I might just need a break, nearly there.

But i feel like everytime I open my mouth people tell me to shut up and they don't care, online, real life. I'm sensitive and it hurts.

Dunno if anyone can help but i just need to vent. I'm so tired despite sleeping. I feel lost and alone and that I should suffer in silence."
440,I just needed to get over the fear of dying,This seems impossible. That's all I think about everyday.
441,Early night,"If I knew I was going to die in my sleep tonight, I'd be very tempted to just be an early night"
442,I think I'm attracted to sadness. I enjoy to cry and stay sad always. I know it sounds weird but is there anyone you else who feel same like me?,"Its a Truth that i love to be sad. I enjoy to sit alone at side while others r having laugh and enjoying time. I feel so awkward &amp; i hate them. I hate those who r enjoying a lot. No i don't think im jelouse, i don't want to be super happy like them . Its like im attracted to sadness. I feel so beautiful when I'm sad or crying or hated or alone. I miss deep cry for something. 

I have never before talked about it to anyone Bcos I was not sure myself if I'm really attracted to sadness but now I know. I wonder is there something wrong with Me? Or there is more people who feel like me?"
443,I wanna run back to the beginning of humanity. Away from this world full of assholes.,"**(skip to the next bolded part if you don't wanna read this stupid story)**

So yesterday I had a frightening experience. I was closing my house's gates when my pet puppy just ran out and almost got his head chopped off. (I stopped the door).

I told my mom about it and ask for help, only to get a response from her that made me realized something: is that people are judgmental assholes. 

She said the work is so simple, and followed up by saying that I can never ask anyone for help. She said if I can't do certain things I'm done because people won't be helping but judging. Even she did that.

I guess she's right. I'm done here.

**people are too fucking judgmental**

From when did people start being so fucking judgmental??? Like nowadays, every action that I do get judged by someone. It could be forgetting to greet someone, or my spending habits, or even my depression. Whenever I ask for help all I got is judgmental words and words, and ""you sucks"" shits.

Reddit is probably the easiest example. Just simply being a ""normie"" and ""dank memers"" would be roasting you.

People never understand! Some tasks are easy for some, hard for others. Like cooking or housework, or using a computer,...

I wanna go back to the time when people lived in tribes. When people don't judge each other whatsoever. When people help each other even though it's something super simple without hard feelings... yes there won't be advanced technology, but I would be way better!"
444,One of my professors finally saw me for who I could be if I wasn't so mentally ill.,"I failed half my classes. I'm not denying that I'm at fault... Because I am. I'm a total piece of shit. My MDD is treatment resistant and often disabling. Can't get out of bed. Can't eat enough, I either over sleep or under sleep. You get the picture. I want to die. I'm sure you guys understand 
But this semester one of my professors gave me the benefit of the doubt, for the first time in a long time. I told him the truth about how I was feeling and he was understanding. 
He was really flexible with me &amp; my depression and actually let me turn my work WEEKS late. Several weeks late. 
Today I got this email from him after he read all my essays in my final. If you're willing, please give it a read.

*Hello therocknamedwonder,*
*I'm so glad you managed to submit this in time.*

*Reading through these labs was a reminder of what a good student you have been, and how much potential you have. Indeed, it was on that basis that I was so willing to move deadlines for you.*

*But I'm glad I did. The labs are well-written, and they all engage with most of the primary sources to provide solid answers to the questions at hand. These were a pleasure to read.*
*Had these portfolios (especially the second one, which was many weeks late) been submitted on time, they would have been in the B+/A- range. But the tardiness of the second portfolio has prompted me to lower that grade to a C. The final portfolio was less late, but you were docked some for not including the final synthetic essay. So that grade is in the C+ range.*

*As for course participation, you did very well. You only had two unexcused absences, and you were always attentive and had thoughtful things to say in class. Indeed, you were one of the leaders in class discussion. So for participation, you earned an A.*

*Taken together, you will walk away from the class with a B-. You are a capable student, and had you been more timely in the completion of your work, you would almost certainly be in the A-range. I nevertheless hope that you feel good about your grade given all that you managed to overcome this semester. That's the kind of perseverance which really matters in life, even if it isn't always registered in metrics like GPA.*
*It was a real pleasure having you in class. I wish the very best in continuing your studies and everything else.*
*Best,*
*DV*

I've never had a teacher do this for me, let alone send me an email like this. I just started bawling my eyes out. Someone saw through my depression--which is all consuming and has completely eaten my ability to do school--and said i am a CAPABLE STUDENT AND THAT I WAS A LEADER IN THE CLASSROOM. I was a pleasure to have in class. It's been so long since I've been this proud of myself. I just needed to tell someone. 

I don't even know what to say to him, this means so much to me and he doesn't even know it. 
In a weird way it almost makes me more sad that I'm not actually a big fuck up and that I'm not just a dumbass. That if I wasn't this sick I could have real potential. But hey I'm gonna get absolutely wasted thanks to this email, for the better. I actually passed a class with a B- no less!!!!!"
445,How do you get a job when you’re too depressed to fill out an application?,"Hello. Sorry for the 4AM post. I haven’t had the energy to write down my feelings in months, and I’m not sure when it will happen again, so I’m going to take a leap on this one. 

I’m unemployed, penniless, and can’t do anything anymore. I’ve got to figure out how to get a job and take care of myself but am struggling to do the absolute bare minimum. It’s pretty bad. 0 hygiene, not able to drive myself anywhere, can’t find it in me to take a shower, etc.

The holidays are getting to me too. I can’t afford presents for anyone this year, so I was going to make them pictures of things they like because I’m a decent drawer. Only problem is, I don’t have the energy to start.

I saw a therapist last week. It was our first appointment, so most of the hour was spent filling out paperwork. But we did have a little time to talk. She said that I show signs some sort of chemical imbalance, and referred me to a psychiatrist right away, and told me to tell them it was urgent. Well I called their office and was told the first appointment for them wasn’t until April, so they booked me with another doctor in February. 

I just don’t know if/how I’m going to be able to wait until then to get help. My normal anti-depressant (Lexapro) doesn’t seem to be helping me much at all. In fact I think it might be increasing the suicidal ideation. I mean I’m sad, but I’ve never thought so much and so clearly about the specifics of ending things. Honestly it’s scary. 

It’s hard. Last week I had nothing left in me. I still don’t, but at least now I have a sliver of hope. I want to fight to stay alive. I just have to find a way to pick myself up before it’s too late.

(Please don’t feel like you have to respond to this post. I am fully aware that creating a post at 4AM is not primetime for most subreddits. I am proud of myself for having the ability to write about it, which is therapeutic in itself.)"
446,i really really want to self-harm,"i have gone months without doing it and i thought i was better but i want to so, so badly. im just such a shitty person in so many ways... i have been blessed w a really amazing SO and great friends but im just horrible and even though i've tried to i have never been able to change. i know its dumb to self harm and that it doesnt fix anything but i still want to so badly. i've just been crying for the last 20-30m straight and i cant even sleep because im so upset."
447,Childhood Memories,"I reached out to one of those hotlines tonight. I went to them in hopes of working through some pretty intense depression that I've been struggling with. But after like 3 hours of talking with them I found myself delving into my childhood. Remembering my shitty childhood and having a few hard memories brought up just made me feel worse. I ended up leaving the hotline and just kind of breaking down in a bathroom at work.   


I'm not very sure what all i was thinking about at the time. I just know that something felt too real, or too hard. I'm confused because the things we were talking about weren't anything outside of what i already had talked about with others. But i just couldn't handle the memories that were coming up. They scared me. Not like they were just painful, but i am frightened of the shit i was feeling. I thought i had felt like shit these past few weeks, but not like this. That fear was so real.   


I haven't talked to a lot of people about this stuff. So I was wondering. Is this something anyone else has dealt with? It's kind of freaking me out and making me think theres something wrong with me."
448,I got told that I might not be able to get therapy for reasons out of my control,"I live in the UK, so in order to get non-private therapy, you need to be referred through your GP. I did that in September 2018, had a screening appointment last December, then had another screening appointment last week.  Therefore, I have been waiting for 15 months to just get through 2 screening appointments. At the one last week, I was told that they basically couldn’t do anything to help. 

I live 2 hours away from my house during the week due to university. I come back during the weekends and if I have any appointments. This has worked for me for three years with no issues. Also, I can’t change GP anyway due to existing rare medical conditions that I’d be hesitant to change to one with no prior knowledge of my medical history. I also only have 5 months left of being at university (I’m in my final year), and considering it can take months to change GP, there’d be no point of doing so.

The doctor took me through the full questionnaire as part of the screening, and although she agreed that CBT could definitely be beneficial, at the end she told me that she couldn’t guarantee that I could reliably attend an appointment every two weeks. She gave me three options; attend university counselling, transfer GP or if my timetable next semester includes three days without classes to go then. I can’t change GP for the reasons listed above, and for the last option, I will need to know by mid-January, which I won’t. I was talking to a counsellor at the university and their services are backed up, so it’d take another number of months to get an appointment there as well—of which it might be too late anyway. 

I’m devastated. I started this process last year, at the beginning of my work placement year so I was at home to avoid a situation like this. I was told in December that the wait would be 6-7 months long. Then I was told 7-8 months. I got my first appointment at the end of September, but I couldn’t attend as I was physically throwing up throughout the night before. I missed the second appointment because they sent the appointment letter 2 days before the appointment, and because the appointment was on a Wednesday, I was in university so I didn’t know it was happening. I can’t help but think these are part of the reason they’re refusing to help—despite neither of those missed appointments being my fault. 

Ever since last week, my depression has got a lot worse. I don’t leave my bed for the most part of the day. I usually skip meals because of it. I sometimes struggle to get out of bed even to go to the bathroom. I’m not sleeping as well. It’s affecting my schoolwork. I want to cry all day. It hasn’t made me suicidal, but it has reiterated in my head that I’m never going to get better because even when I reach out for help, I don’t get it.  

I suppose this is more of a vent than anything else, because none of my friends or family around me seem to really understand how much it’s got me down. Thanks for anyone that’s read this far &lt;3"
449,I don't want to die but I don't think I can live like this.,"I'm going to start this with saying I'm not diagnosed with depression. I am trying to see a psychologist soon and have all of the common symptoms of depression. For the sake of this post I'm going to call it depression.

I think I've been depressed for the past 3-4 years, there have definitely been better and worse times, I've been at the very least functional and able to go to school and act normal enough for it to not be a cause for concern with my family and friends.

Recently due to some events at school, my depression has gotten much worse. I am skipping school, isolating myself, constantly tired, at times unable to feed myself and very apathetic. I constantly feel stupid and have 0 motivation, my relationship with my boyfriend is getting harder since i can barely hold a conversation and am almost always crying  because everything is too hard.

I've started having suicidal thoughts again which coupled with me now being able to drive is concerning. I don't want to be alive but i know that will crush my boyfriend. I try to spend more time asleep than awake but I have trouble sleeping for the first time. My boyfriend thinks I'm severely depressed as I am showing similar symptoms to him when he was depressed. I wish I was never born and don't think my family would notice as they never wanted me and have made it known to me. I think about doing them a favour and killing myself a lot but I know I can't. I love my boyfriend too much to ever put him through something like this. I'm not sure what the point of all of this is.

I just don't think I can live like this much longer as I struggle to function and do basic tasks."
450,To my principal who left me mentally scarred,"Welp here goes.

I was in second grade and had a crush on a girl in my class sooo I gathered what courage I had in me and went up to her and told her that she's cute and I liked her. She went to the principal office and told her what I said to her.

Now here's the thing, my dumbass didn't knew at the time that the principal daughter had ran away with a student from her school 2-3 years ago so she was super against school romances and co-education in general.

So an hour later she came to my class, called my name out, brought me infront of the class and beat the ever living shit out of me infront of my teacher and my class mates. I was bleeding from the nose, crying furiously and shivering like I'm about to pass out. She kept on punching my face, slapping me as hard as she could and when her hands hurt she used a wooden Cane to beat me up. I was made an example for the whole class and school. I was made to hold my ears while I was still bleeding from the nose and crying like I just wanted it all to end.

Because of that experience I cannot talk to girls that are not related to me or I don't know. Even if someone approaches me to ask for help it takes me a thousand thoughts before I could even utter a ""hello"" back. This has been a huge problem for me and my dating life is dead. I'm probably gonna die alone, I think cuz the fear of saying something stupid and getting in trouble again kills me so that's what I have to deal with for the rest of my life.

My principal passed away last week and I didn't wanted her to die peacefully while she made someone else life a living hell. 

I hope their is an afterlife cuz I really want to see her burn in hell."
451,I'm sick or this!,"You know what? I'm sick of constantly feeling anxious, down, and worthless. If depression could only take a corporeal form, I would bludgeon him to death."
452,Stopped getting attached,"Anyone else always got hurt by people so you stopped being attached. But in return last your emotional capacity and empathy so now you're a robot.

Fun stuff"
453,I should just accept the fact that I will never be employed,It's been more than a year since I was let go. At this point I honestly think I'm just not good at anything and will never be employed. I'm just so sick of being a burden to my family. I honestly wish I would just drop dead.
454,Im broke so hard,"Did it happened to you that, a good friend of yours, wanted to combine with your crush, after you conffesed everything to her, and refused you?Like this girl, first, tought my friend is a shit, and it changed her mind, that he is a good person now, and my friend, laughed as hell when i was taking time with this girl, and now  he asks me why we are not anymore friends?"
455,"I wish people would stop telling me that ""it's gonna get better"". It fucking won't.","I've heard that fucking shit for years. At first I tried to believe it cause yeah it makes sense there are happy people I guess and I could still hold on to the fact that yeah maybe my teenager brain wasn't really helping me seeing things clearly. I thought my life would eventually get better so I held on, I fought for years against my own suicidal self. Got medication but it didn't help. Went to see several therapists but they didn't help -- one of them particularly was terrible when I think of it.

I really tried to hold on to the idea that things could be better someday. But I'm 23 and I'm probably at one of the lowest I've ever been. I dropped out of college cause I couldn't deal with the pressure, I got fired from my job one year ago and I didn't find any other job since, the only real opportunity I had was something I couldn't do because of my fucked up mental health. I'm living with my partner and I'm the only one who has to provide for both of us and since I don't have any income anymore we've been mostly surviving, making sure our pets have enough to eat even if we have to eat pastas for the rest of the month to do that. I know she resents me because I'm not able to give her a proper life I can't provide what she needs but I'm trying. 

Nothing gets better. It just gets worse and worse and I'm stuck in this fucking limbo where I have nothing to do so I don't leave my apartment anymore and I just try to kill time by watching Netflix or sleeping cause I don't have the mental strength to do anything else. I can't kill myself because I still need to provide for my partner my two cats and her dog if I kill myself I'm not sure what would happen to them so I have to stay around, to force myself to go out of bed everyday, to apply for jobs I know I won't get, to eat the same stupid shit everyday, to try to find happiness in small things like my cats or a good TV show. But nothing fills the void. I thought it would get better cause I had a great partner and an okay job and I was doing okay for some time but turns out it was just me pretending, lying to myself so much that I actually started to believe it for a second before it all came back to my fucking face. 

I'm tired. Sometimes I feel crushed by the weight of being alive. It never. Gets. Better. It's just a long and slow torture of trying and trying everyday to fit in a world that doesn't want you and really isn't even worth it. Everything has gone to shit and people are awful and nothing matters anymore except having a perfect successful life you can post about on Instagram to make everyone else feel like shit. Love doesn't help because even the best partner will get tired of this eventually, cause it's too tiring, too demanding, too heartbreaking to see the person you love not being able to really live because they'd rather be dead. Honestly if I wasn't that much of a coward I would kill myself right now. I guess my girlfriend could still go back to her parents' and I know she'd take care of my cats for me cause she knows how much I love them. Really there's nothing else holding me back that much other than the fact that I'm a coward. 

I just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up again. I never asked for that shit. I never wanted to be alive in the first place. That shit is too exhausting and isn't worth the effort. I haven't felt anything other than pain, anger and numbness in twelve years and I'm sick of it. I'm not sure how much longer I can go on surviving like this. I just want everything to stop."
456,I've lost every motive to live,"2nd time on here thought life would get better but I've come to realize  that it isn't getting better:

1. My academic life is just shit and not getting better I can't get myself to study , all my peers got good grades and celebrating meanwhile I failed half my subjects , I'd convinced myself and my family that I'd be able to achieve and make them proud but in the end I became worse at everything.
2. My social life  is a complete mess I have zero friends , all of my peers have friends and are happy with their life and are out there enjoying life and such and the only two ""friends"" are just there to keep me from killing myself like oh don't be sad you can do it shit like that and I know they just do it to not feel any guilt if I ever do it
3. My family fucking hates me they all say they want me to be a better person which I fucking see through as a failed attempt to motivate me and so far the only reason I haven't hanged myself is cause my elderly parents would die of shock if I do it and I can't die with that kinda guilt
4. My mental health has hit rock bottom I can barley get out of bed and get ready for uni , going every day doing the same shit is fucking killing me and seeing all the people around me happy and shit is the worst thing ever , waking up everyday knowing that you are a mistake and no one on gods green earth would want to be your friend.
5. My love life I know this is fucking cliche as hell but it's a reason as well after the last time I just can't get myself to put myself in a relationship where there is a chance of it failing again but for some fucking reason my brain has put it's sights on a girl that is out of my fucking league and not a snowflakes chance in hell for her to even have any sorta emotions towards me I talk to her but I can read the look in her eyes as like I'd rather be talking to literally anyone else it's just killing me

last but not least I lost every reason to pursue anything in life I haven't gone to a therapist cause I'm sure they won't know how to help me and I know no matter how hard I try it will never get better so here's hoping shit gets better on it's own cause I'm running on fumes.

Good luck everyone with your lives cause I know mine ain't getting any better"
457,Noone hates me,"I wish they did, it'd mean someone care"
458,Am I even interested in girls’ personalities?,"I like some women’s personalities, but sometimes I wonder if I’m really just motivated to talk with them by sexual desire. I’ve never had a deep connection with a girl. I’m such a fucking failure at talking with and actually connecting with people, and I feel like I’m going to live the rest of my life like this, all alone and smothered by depression."
459,Horrible feelings (Trigger warning: mention of suicide),"Throwaway for privacy.

I can't stop obsessing about this since last night. I usually hate posting but I feel so angry that I needed to talk to someone.
I spoke to two counsellors tonight and I left feeling worse.

There was an altercation between me and my mum last night. I still feel horrible because I ended up screaming about how al the abuse had made me suicidal the last several months and I'd tried to act on the thoughts when I was hypomanic.

I hate violence but that is the only language my parents/family understand. So to stop my mum's emotional and verbal abuse I decided to get angry and started throwing things and yelling about everything. Now I'm depressed because I feel horrible for acting that way, but I have to be honest and admit that it felt good, the adrenaline, being able to say how I felt for once.

The counsellors shamed me for acting violently and suggested family counselling. But they don't understand. I did what I had to do, to protect myself.

My parents aren't normal, I'm certain they suffer from personality disorders. They are the type to laugh at you when you're down, to abuse you if you're sick. All my life I have tried to *never* act emotionally if I was angry, to do anything that would hurt others, like they way they hurt me. But I tried everything.

Yelling at my dad got him to finally stop controlling my sleep, got my brother to not beat me up. Why couldn't the counselors understand? I feel so depressed and have been thinking about suicide ever since last night. Now I feel worse after talking to them. My outburst and violence made me physically sick and I can't sleep but deep down I know that if it happened again that that is probably the only thing I can do."
460,Extreme Feeling of Disgust,Does anyone ever feel completely disgusted by their existence? It happens to me every now and then. I feel revolted by my appearance or extreme embarrassment with my life circumstances. I can feel my stomach turning when I get that way. The weird part is is it feels like the only way to get that feeling to go away is to hurt myself in awful ways. Anyone else?
461,Waking up and how it feels,"Lets put aside all the mental torture associates with it,we all know it. You remember your life again, unimaginable pain and dread immediately consumes you, you want to blow your fucking head off right thrn and there.

But why the hell does it also have to feel like i was just yanked out of a fucking grave? 

My eyes fucking hurt, my whole body is fucked up, I have ZERO energy. No matter if I sleep 16 hours, or 6, or 7, or 8, or whatever is the bullshit duration made up by all those apps.

Just getting out of bed feels like thats all I can do for the day.

And its just the start. From there I have to spend 1 hour getting ready for work where I am too stupid to do it right and Im just praying to go home.

Fuck I just want to stop lying and escape this farce of an existence"
464,I hate waking up every day,"I hate waking up every day because that means I just have to deal with the emptiness that consumes me. I used to be happy in high school but now as a junior in college very few things bring happiness to me. Even then sometimes it's a fake happiness masking the pain inside me. I can't really do the thing I enjoy most because it's hard to ride a motorcycle in the winter in the Midwest.

I'm just this socially awkward weirdo that can't talk to anyone unless I know them. I don't talk to anyone at college and I try to avoid any possible conversations there. I don't feel like I have the same skills needed for jobs/internships that other people going for the same degree have. 

I don't find myself attractive, never had a girlfriend, never kissed a girl, can't even talk to girls I like or girls in general really. I get jealous whenever I see couples because I just wish I could have that same companionship but I can't.

Life for me just feels hollow and pointless. I feel like I won't amount to anything. Am I suicidal? No, or at least I don't think I am. I've cut myself before but that doesn't really help. I've taken some oxy too just out of spite. I feel like life isn't really worth living anymore but I do it anyway. Honestly, getting t-boned by a semi would just expedite the process.

Idk, I just don't see the point of things."
465,"Just had a movie marathon with my date friend, it was great. Then when he drove off in his car, I started driving to my home and promptly broke down into tears.","I cry a lot on the way home I guess. When things get too much in my head or I just feel bad. It’s a thing that happens. I feel gross and weirdly empty that it happened after such a fun day of movies. We saw Frozen, Ford VS Ferrari, Last Christmas, Jumanji 2 and Queen &amp; Slim. So I shouldn’t have been so upset. Near the end we were talking about our job (we work for the same company) and how people were upset with the new schedule. He mentioned that he may take that as a sign to go back to his old job that paid way more and gave more benefits. I can’t begrudge him for that, he deserves to be happy. 

Then I saw in my work group chat that a lot of people are contemplating jumping ship as well which is.. fair I guess. I’m not happy with it that much either but.. it’s such a big change. I think I’m scared my date friend will forget me. That my work friends will forget me. Work friends always forget me when we switch jobs or leave them. It’s sad. 

I also didn’t get nearly as many hours as I thought and I’ve realized that my level of feeling accomplished and feeling useful is really tied to how much I work. Which is probably tied to how much my dad has always killed himself with his 2 jobs. I just want to be useful and productive. It terrifies me that I may have to go back to Starbucks after I finally left there this previous summer after 2 years of not so much fun. I know things change. I’m just not ready to deal with any of it. Maybe I am. 

I messaged my date friend and told him I cried when I got home to get it out of my system (it was in the middle of a longer message I sent). He just said, “ah alright. I’m happy you got it out of your system and am feeling better.” Which is.. great. I guess? I also have an inner voice telling me I made it awkward and weird and I shouldn’t have told him that. He’s so nice though. He deserves to be happy and paid for his actual talents. I’m just stuck and I don’t think I know how to move in any directions besides probably backwards.

Even though we were at the movies all day I only drank water. I didn’t want to spend money I didn’t have on food that wouldn’t even be filling. I got home and I haven’t eaten anything besides a piece of chocolate. I just feel so gross and weird and empty. I used to be known as an avid reader so I have these 2 bookshelves full of books I loved and love. I’m honestly thinking of just donating the lot for the money and giving up on spending money on non necessities. Pleasures are becoming so much of a drag and I just don’t know.

466,I hate depression but I love depression?,"Depression makes me feel ""depressed"", but the very things that are stereotypically supposed to make me ""happy"" make me feel dead inside, such as Christmas and religion. Brand New (band) makes me feel depressed. Goodnight Punpun (manga) makes me feel depressed. Challenger Deep and Metamorphosis (books) makes me feel depressed. Jreg (Youtuber) makes me feel depressed. Not only do they make me feel depressed, they make me feel liberated and understood in a way that no one has ever understood me. It makes me feel liberated as it speaks the words and expresses the emotions that I'm too chicken to speak and express. Feeding my depression hurts me, but it also heals me, and without it I'd feel ""dead inside"", or rather nonexistent in the most cold and boring way. Is it a friend or is it an enemy?"

471,To those who have recovered - does lost Agency return?,"I'm coming out of a very long depression (11-25) and my mood is improving significantly with each passing month, but I haven't recovered any of my natural agency. Before my depression reached its critical mass, I would naturally find myself driven to do things like socialize or chase (admittedly small) goals. I still don't have any of that. Aside from being very disciplined about forcing myself to do work and study as needed, I don't do anything productive or fun. The first 4 days of my winter holiday from university have been spent aimlessly browsing the internet and I'm incredibly bored. 

I think that the root source of this problem is either 

1) Fear and anxiety that hasn't gone away since the start of the depression or 

2) Weakened instincts due to the depression

What I mean by (2) is that I don't feel any intrinsic motivations. All of the activities (that I take pride in) are done out of a sense of duty and for potential future benefits, but I don't do anything that I genuinely enjoy. For instance, I recognized that I needed to socialize more, so I started dancing regularly, but I don't feel the urge to socialize at a whim. I want a girlfriend, but I don't actually feel any sexual drive to propel me into getting one. The most I can manage is to force myself to interact with women, but my efforts are very synthetic and this bothers me. I study hard because I want future benefit; I don't have any desire to make money or purchase things: I simply recognize that having higher social status and earning power will result in higher quality of life and that I'll be less depressed if I achieve these things.

To anyone who has successfully recovered from depression, did the agency ever return? Ideally, I would like to be more driven, less risk averse (preferably fearless), and less robotic. I want to be the guy who grabs life by the horns and gets shit done. I want to be a fiery, risk-taking business owner who seizes opportunities with little caution."
472,Does anyone else die alittle inside when you see young people with friends going out?,"While I sit alone my house, dealing with my miserable life waiting to kill me"
473,The begin of this year you would have,"told me that I would be stabilization center, have therapist and case manager and started to cut myself I would Rolling my eyes at you. But now I’m sitting here thinking how my life has changed this past year alone and think I would have ever thought I’ll be here. Trying figure out what I’m going to do either do it or try to live but I feel like I have already made that decision. I want to live fight but I’m stubborn and have too much pride to go and live in homeless shelter. I don’t have good relationship with the family that live in the same state as me. Don’t have many friends that I can’t live with. So it’s like crap what I’m going to do. I know commit suicide is bad but I feel like there is no other choice. But I can’t do it I’m afraid what will happen after? What if I fail at it?"
474,I don't want to feel different,"I don't want to feel different, like an outsider. Why should i be treated like that when i just don't want what other people want, what other people like. Why should i be left out? Maybe because i couldn't force myself to feel happy? 

Sorry for my incoherent writing. I don't know what i'm doing."
475,I think I've reaalized why I have a hard time explaining anything to anyone about my illness,"It's easy to say ""they just don't understand"" but I'm trying to find causes. When it comes to my parents and teachers, I can easily point a finger at generation gaps, and this is definitely a factor, my mom said so herself. She said they're the generation that wasn't coddled and that was expected to take everything. I keep telling her that just because that's what it was like doesn't mean it was right, not to mention the completely different socioeconomic conditions in the country but to no avail. They just can't bridge that gap and understand our struggle.

Other than that though, it's the fact that no one seems to understand that depression, just like any illness, affects ***every aspect of your life.*** Sticking to the example of my mom and my class teacher, when I tried to get some support in school, like for the professors to be a bit understanding if I'm unable to cooperate or if I need a test postponed or something (they've done it before for a classmate who has depression), I was immediately jumped at with assumptions that I'm trying to get out of things. They don't understand that my symptoms affect everything in my life, the way I spend my free time, the way I study, the way I am in social situations, *everything.* I reassured my mom and my class teacher somehow, but there's still this huge gap because of how much they don't get it.

My mom asked how do I differenciate between what's a symptom and what isn't. And honestly? I have no fucking clue. Sometimes I just know. Sometimes I sit and wonder if I'm just faking. I really don't know. But I mean, when I'm sitting in class, and something triggers me, and I begin to shake and lose my breath and then for the rest of the day I feel like shit, I'm pretty fucking sure that's a symptom, Deborah.

I do have support, I won't complain about that. But everyone seems to be giving it out of a sense of responsibility and the fear that I'll kill myself. As soon as I say ""no I'm not in danger of hurting myself"" everyone kinda sighs a breath of relief and fucks off. They don't understand that the fucking *illness is still there, it's everywhere in my life.* Just because I don't want to kill myself (right now) doesn't mean I'm not ill damn it."
476,my mom won’t let me get help,"soo.. i’ve been depressed since i was little (trying to not go into much detail here) and i finally reached out to my schools councillor (note: i used to go to therapy a long time ago, but stopped cause it was too expensive) and she referred me to a therapist, i decided to give it a shot. we talked quite a bit (within a few sessions of course) and he thought that anti-depressants might benefit me. i had to tell my mom before i could get them though, so I told my lovely mother that anti depressants might be good for me and she said i was faking being depressed and that i was ”fine”. She isn’t letting me see my therapist anymore or get anti depressants.. shits rough."
477,My wife is on Zoloft and now she doesn’t remember me,"My wife went up to 200mg of Zoloft and the doctor said it would help her with OCD but now her long term memories are gone. She doesn’t remember her parents. She doesn’t remember how we met or what we did. She thinks I am a stranger and she just co-exists with me. She wants a divorce now because she doesn’t love me anymore and I am just holding her back. She thinks it’s all fine because she has no OCD now so she can be happy and refuses to cut down her meds. I suggested maybe try lower it to 150mg and then 100mg and see if it still helps but takes away the memory issues. She refuses. She says that when she looks at me her mind goes blank like I am a stranger. 

Called doctor on the phone today because it’s her last day and the doctor is away for Christmas and will be back mid Jan. She said that long term memory loss can’t be an issue from Zoloft or Abilify which is what my wife is on. She suggested we go down to 150mg but not any lower and my wife refuses because she doesn’t think there is any problem and she doesn’t want her memories back because it was just child hood trauma and now she can live normal life and no longer wants me to be part of it. We been together for 5 years. Basically my whole adult life and I did everything to support her. She doesn’t want to try make it work she is basically ready to leave out the door tomorrow. I offered couple counselling but she refused.

How can I make her see the issue? The medications have taken my wife away and my life. She has also tried everything else in the past but it never helped her and only had side effects but this is helping her so she doesn’t want to stop. I mean really she has struggled with sczhophernia and anxiety / depression all her life and basically tried everything with lots of doctor. I am glad it’s helping her OCD now but what about future she has forgotten me completely. She doesn’t care about the consequences about leaving me either. I am really suicidal. Any suggestions any one has?"
478,Falling into old habits.,"For awhile now I thought I was ""better"", I moved out had a job for awhile, but now I'm going back home because I couldn't handle it. I was living with friends but the longer I spent with them the more I realize how distant I am from them, I know everything about them but for years I've been to scared to open up to other people that my friends know nothing about me past surface level because I practically hide from them.

I haven't really felt sad for awhile until now, my loneliness has set back in. I was dating awhile back but I ruined that like every other relationship in my life, I miss him but he's moved on and I'm dealing with that. I'm hoping I can make real friends in college here soon, or meet someone else, anything to make me feel like a significant part in someone's life, or vice versa. I've been drinking a lot as well which I know doesn't help but it's the only time I have fun and drop my defenses around my friends. Sorry if this wall of text isn't necessarily coherent, I'm pretty tired but I kinda want to vent. I'm really tired of being the cold person I am, all my relationships feel artificial and I'm an asshole to everyone, and then online I act really desperate and cringy for the hope someone will notice me and when I catch myself doing that I feel disgusted with myself, it's such pathetic behavior. I've had so many shitty experiences that it's practically impossible to trust people or have real relationships unless I'm shitfaced, but im really not a bad or cold person at heart, I really care about people I'm just bad at showing it and closeness scares me so I act like a jackass again. Whenever I start to open up though I like explode and smother people with my repressed bullshit.

How do i stop feeling like an outsider in every group I'm in? How do I get over my shitty past and live a normalish life with actual relationships. Anyway I'm gonna sleep off this bummy ass night. Thanks for reading this incoherent mess."
479,My life has no meaning,"I have nothing to live for. Nothing excites me anymore. 
I'm in University but I can't find something that makes me really interested about it. 
All I have is some video games' lore, and that's it - but sometimes it's no even that because I get tired of even researching those games. I'm useless... But I don't want to end up a NEET, so I force myself through the day and try to accomplish something, all while trying to ignore my suicidal intentions. I feel like it's all about convincing myself that life is actually worth living and that I just need a few more years to understand why, but I'm tired of lying to myself. 

What can I do? I'll be going to the gym starting from next year in the hopes of having a socially acceptable habit and maybe get some free endorphins, but really I feel like life has no purpose and it's killing me inside. 
I see all these people around me being so excited about things and enjoying their lives, but how do they do it? And why can't I be just like everyone else, and not worry about these things? Or maybe even just have a constant habit instead of giving up my interests every week or so..."
480,"Well, this is different.","Normally I try to be the one to support everyone i can. But now i cant even support myself.

I think I know why im feeling like hell, and i know theres not a damn thing i can do about it.

So i guess ill start at the beginning. I was dating the most wonderful girl I had ever met. I was happy. As cliché as it sounds, just thinking about her made me happy. Seeing her was amazing. Like the first time I ever saw her all over again every time.

Just after our 1 year together, she left me.

2 weeks later i kinda rebounded on someone ive known for over 4 years.

Here i am about 6 months later realising im not happy with her, not happy at home, and im completely unmotivated to do anything. All I want is to be alone. I know that if I leave her, that it'd mess her up cause shes only known people leaving her. I know my parents wouldnt be fans of my decision because they love her and think she and I are the most adorable couple ever.

Basically what I'm saying is, i need to stop being a little bitch about it and just leave her. But i just cant.

It doesn't help that today my ex told me she got into another relationship. That hurt. Cause I'd love to have her back. But anyway. It's 315am and I have 2 finals tomorrow so I should probably go to sleep."
481,"Dealing with depression, The worst yet","I’ve never been this sad every night and day, I believe it is because of my chronic illness. When I got diagnosed in July with Ulcerative Colitis I’ve been told I have changed. Another than that the fact my childhood was horrible and I was abused by my stepdad makes it worse. I never realized how screwy my life was until I got married and saw how different things were. Right now I have to make a decision and it’s gonna worsen my depression. I think I should cut ties with my mom, I love her but her staying with my stepdad despite all the times we have tried to get her to leave is dumb. My stepdad bullied me because I was biracial and not his. He also was touchy and he would grab on me sometimes which made me walk sideways when I was near him. He had also would call me slurs down me every change he got and would drink every night. Well he had changed for awhile finally but now he’s worse he is even abusing sober. I found out now that my stepdad is grabbing on my little sister now who is his real daughter. I even found out that he has punched her in the face twice, I also found out when she was a child he beat her in her private areas with a toy bat. Also just recently today he was made at her and proceeded to slap her in the face while she slept. I love my mom, But I’m tired of it she always says give me time and I told her we GAVE HER YEARS. My brother won’t even visit her now and I can’t go down because of my son and his safety. At one point he had changed completely no abuse and he changed back which hurt me so bad. He was always strict growing up to, People can’t believe the rules we had to abide by...my question or just in need advice is this. My mom is a victim he puts her down everyday he even beat her once with his purse when stuff was in it heavy stuff, He apparently raped her once to. The list of what he has done to us all is crazy. However she’s an enabler and she has put us through hell and I will say I was not a good kid but how the heck could she stay? I picture my son in that situation and I almost bawl. We weren’t allowed to flush the toilet unless it was yellow, No going out more than once a day, No staying out past 3, No male cousins because we may sleep with them, No locked doors, No music, No lights on during the day, No friends of color or lgbtq, No eating anywhere without a plate, No standing in the kitchen for to long, No laying in the sofa. My mom is mad at my sister for telling me he slapped her??? I’m so upset right now I’m just done with her...He doesn’t even work anymore she supports him now she doesn’t need him. I’m afraid if I ignore her than I’m going to be sorry like the what if’s...but I don’t deal with it."

And today, I find out he’s still talking to his fucking ex, the one that cheated on him. Im heartbroken, I feel used, just a fucking thing he used to make himself feel better. I was drunk when I found out, and I just cried for an hour at a party, locked myself in a bathroom.

(as I write this right now I’m still thinking that) but I made a commitment to myself that I am going to crawl and pry my way to find a way out of this dark dark place... I have occasional thoughts of hurting my self... but I realized that I want to live.. I just don’t want to feel like shit which is a paradox 🙄 cause I feel like life is always going to be shit but either way I told myself if life is going to be shit. I’d rather just do what I can to make it the best shit it can be. So I worked out 2 days in a row! And it’s the hardest thing ever to get there but it’s the only place where I “feel” anything right now.... it’s pretty absurd... the pain in the gym by pushing my body is an escape from the pain I normally go through. So instead of giving up when the rep hurts I keep going to feel all the pain. I guess it’s like self harm but in the healthiest way to do it?? 🤷🏽‍♂️ I’m eating well enough to recover. So I think I’m on to something 🤔

489,I dont think I can do this anymore,"Ive been dealing with a disdain for life since .. Forever, for as long as i can remember. I remember when i was like, really little, i would pray to die. Beg and cry some unseen 'god' to take it ll away. And i jus.. Kept livin like tht.. To afraid to kill myself, too afraid to talk to anyone.. I used to cut myself jus to feel something.. Anything other then what was in my head. 
I've since tried to open up, many, many times to many, many ppl.. But its constant for me, and i guess nobody wants to deal with that.. Ive always kinda felt alone but after losing person after person after person, thats pretty well been solidified in me.. I am truly and well alone.. I destructive tendencies turned from self harm (which i no longer do bexaise of a promise with a friend and we both wear rings everyday as a symbol.. But not even she can deal with me.. We nvr talk rlly, and she got happier- and im happy for her.. Im just not.. Happy) turned into drug abuse and avoiding people and crying myself to sleep hugging my pillow or some alcohol bottle.. 
I just dont think im ever gunna feel good.. Ive never been.. Anything special, to anyone.. To myself.. I started making music at some point in highschool, but i nvr had money to rlly make anything stellar, and what i Have made nobody cares about.. Even though music is probably what I've come to love the most.. To see as the most stable in life, i dont invest myself like I should.. Recently ive been trying to, actually buying beats, got a video person now.. Someone to edit my vocals.. Its just all been so hard and i damn near reached a breaking point tonight.. I lost something that has consistently been there for me for years, that id grown used to, and losing it was like losing part of myself.. Its winter where im at right now.. Like cold ass winter.. I just wanted to go.. Head anywhere.. Nearest town where id have anywhere to gonis like 6 hours, but i dont think i actually wanted to make it.. Idk why but instead i came backnwhere im staying and jist decided to write this instead.. I dont know what to do. Trust me ive heard it all.. I think, idk , i think ive just grown tired of all this .. More tired then i rlly thought possible. I no longer believe im any gods, even if sometimes i pray to all of them that ill finally die and just be done with it..ive really been thinking about .. Finding someway to do it myself, quite a lot recently.. It all just hurts so damn much.. People have always said it gets better or itll be alright but it doesnt its only ever got worse.. I feel unbearable pain in a place where you can't just drink it away, trust me ive tried.. Im 22 now, my birthday was 17 days ago.. 
Maybe thats long enough. I know I've had my full like 10 times over by now.. I jus wanna hug someone, and cry, but i have nobody.. Everyone just leaves eventually so who even cares enough about me to deal with it anyway.. We're humans and we're ruthless and mean at times, maybe this is my punishment.. Maybe this is hell"

492,Struggling to find the will to be better,"This is my first post on this subreddit, so hey I guess. I am an 18 year old male, 6’0, long, chest length hair, and what I would call decent facial features on a face that doesn’t fit them. I live in Missouri. though I won’t tell you where, It’s close enough to Kansas City that I’ll just say around that area though. I’m currently living in a house that’s falling apart due to late coming marital issues with my parents. I was raised (by boomers lmao, my dad is 56 and my mom is 54) with the entire idea that I would never be facing this issue. My parents were “different” and divorce was to never even be considered, even though they would fight more often than a healthy couple should, some of the longest going days even. But here I am now, about to turn 18, with little money saved and few options to turn to if the house gets sold or if shit hits the fan. I can’t go with my dad because I’m a fucking sad sack and he has no money and no assets (bankruptcy in 2009 after the economic failure and subsequent lack of job) so going with him requires 50 hours a week, losing my social life, getting an apartment to live in, and because I make min wage I would be spending all my money and checks on purely living. I wouldn’t have time for the few friends I even have and because my parents conditioned me my entire life to be dependent, the transition would be horrible and I would probably get fired, realistically speaking because I know myself. Going with my mom however is worse because even though my dad is an asshole (he has his own issues, he is an aggressive man with bipolar tendencies and anger issues and he gets out of control and will escalate ridiculous arguments over small meaningless things) he was at least there in my life though. He tried, and always claimed to have golden intentions and would at least apologize after every beating and every verbal abuse. My mother wasn’t even there though. She’s worked night shift my entire life, only ever having Thursday and Friday off, leaving at 3:45 in the afternoon every other day and coming home at the same time the next morning. I feel like she barely loves me sometimes, and cares more about her two other estranged sons SHE HERSELF abandoned before. My father uses the fact that he’s the morally superior option to guilt trip the shit out of me, making me feel like I shouldn’t love my mother, even though I do. Making it seem like he would just disappear from my life if I don’t go with him. I hate this shit. On top of all this, I hate my life anyways. I have 2 real friends, they’re like family though. I have other acquaintances at my 22 hour a week at “brob brevins” but that’s it’s. I have had negative luck with women, I get too attached too fast and scare them off because of my issues with relationships and having had like 20% of the maternal raising that I needed (probably) I’ve been cheated on three
Times, been too stupid to notice flirting and signals other times, and other stupid shit with girls. I feel like it’s hopeless and that I’m going to be without female companionship at all until I’m at least 21, and even at that point I still feel like it will take longer. I have no plans on going to college due to being a member of a broke ass family and don’t plan on meeting new people I would get along with on that level in the town I’m in right now ever. I’m a stupid gross pothead, I smoke weed to numb my crazy emotions and to feel like a normal person, a habit I only picked up when I was almost 18 (I turn 19 in January). I haven’t showered in almost a week in a half and only don’t stink because I never had that bad of a body odor and I don’t sweat a lot and also use good deodorant and spray. I just don’t feel any desire to better my situation. All the bullshit with my parents HAS gotten me to realize I need to save money and try to find another place to live with my best friend, but I will be the same person there as I am here. My life is a mess and I have no plans at all for the future or how to maintain myself. I’m not a slob, I weigh 240 even but it’s filled out and a decent amount of it is natural muscle so I don’t really think I look fat at all, though I’m definitely obese/overweight. I guess the point of this is that I just want advice. Any advice at all, or comments. I have zero other ways to get it and my parents are so disconnected from how society works now that all the shit they spew ends up being bullshit. I just dunno man. I just don’t know what to do."
493,Want to kill myself but it would break my dad’s heart,I’ve thought about it for some time and I was becoming more accepting that this would actually happen until my mom died a few days ago and while my parents have been divorced for some time seeing my dad so sad made me feel so horrible. I don’t want to deal with this anymore but I can’t help but feel so selfish knowing if I did my dad would be destroyed.
494,I've never been happy,I lived with my dad ever since I was 1 year old.  School was vary hard for me.  I could not read until 2nd grade and was only able to  spell super easy words. Was about the same with every other subject in school.  School and my family blamed it all on me . Had no friends and was the picked on kid . So I would always be in trouble at school and would be scared to go home every day.  I would spend endless hours in my room.  No TV no radio and was the early 90s without phones.  This was a daily thing until I was in high school.  And after never having any friends I excepted anyone who would talk to me. The little group I started hanging out with was the smoking circle before school.  Was cigarettes btw. When I turned 18 years old I was starting my senior year.  Was in special education so I could graduate with a certificate of completion.  Got lucky and found a girlfriend and a job . Moved out immediately . This is where my education fails me. I know I dont have to answer to my dad or the schools bs anymore.  So I did the bare minimum of days required. Now I'm on my own supporting my girlfriend.  She started cheating on me.  Lost my job and I'm forced to live in the homeless shelter.  Did that for the next 2 months.  This is 2010 when jobs was extremely hard to come by. But I stayed at it until I got a job at service engineering.  Good paying job so on. Job lasted roughly 5 months do to the fact a lot of the kids that made fun of me worked there and started god awful rumors about me.  And on top of that I'm not good at anything.  Was just like school.  So back to the homeless shelter this goes on until my mom decided she want to be a part of my life and I move out of town. Get a job doing car parts.  I do that for over a year before I get fired for making to many mistakes.  Job required a lot of math that I couldn't do. Only had a 5th grade level in the subject.  Goes on and on . I'm embarrassed by saying I was in special education so everyone just thinks I dont want to work. That I'm a bum . I can about end my story hear because life is still this way. I'm 28 years old. Never had anything.  I'm currently in another town away from mom and dad.  I live in another homeless shelter currently and I feel like I don't feel welcome hear. I'm scared and more depressed than ever.  I want to commit suicide but I'm to big of a pussy to do that.  I'm not sure what to do.  I'm leaving this at that.
495,I feel lost in my own mind,I’ve been battling depression and anxiety for awhile now and it always seems when I take one step getting better I take 10 steps back into the nothingness I feel I don’t wanna die but I don’t wanna live I feel stuck I feel as if there’s nothing that matters I feel that I’m worthless i have these feelings that I can’t explain where I just get quiet and annoyed and I just wish sometimes I could just lay down and turn off all my senses my sight my hearing taste touch everything cause then maybe I wouldn’t be worried or sad or anything I would just be on the line of non existant and alive idk if that makes sense but what I feel sometimes doesn’t make sense how my depression takes over not only my mind and body but my entire life and I don’t wanna talk to people about it cause they won’t understand cause I don’t understand I can’t explain how I feel sometimes it just constant things that used to make me happy don’t know more for example video games I’ll play for a good 15 to 20 minutes then all of sudden I’m just laying in bed feeling so numb with no emotion not sad happy angry nothing I feel as if my body is being dragged around everyday I know I have people around me who care about me and love me but that doesn’t seem to help it seems to make it worse and idk why I feel as if I’m a just a passenger in my own mind I hate my self and I hate life I don’t really understand fully my depression and I don’t know how to explain it any better than this I know it may not make sense but every day doesn’t make sense I just wanna feel like myself again but everyday it seems like I get farther and farther from my self and I can’t stop it
496,Spending Christmas alone,"Hello all and Merry Christmas.

So, the holidays are now amongst us and I have to say, it's a bittersweet time of year for me. As a kid, I always loved this time of year! Not only because of the presents, but all the small traditions I grew up with that my family used to do, like we would go as a family to the tree lot to pick out our tree. Then we would take it home and decorate it, my mom would make all of us hot cocoa and we when we're finished decorating the tree, we'd sit by the fire place and roast some s'mores and enjoy the evening together. Stuff like that would make Christmas even better! 

Now, I'm now 27 and I recently moved out from my home and moved to another state. This will be my first Christmas all alone and idk what to do. My family is back home in cali and I'm here in Tennessee. I can't afford to take time off work and pay for my flight to visit. Now I've already accepted the fact that I will be alone for Christmas, and since I really havent made any solid friends here yet, it's definitely going to be lonely and I've been feeling depressed about it. All my coworkers are talking about what they're family plans for Christmas and when I'm out and about either grocery shopping, or at the mall, I can't help but hear and see all of these happy couples and families enjoying the holiday and I'm here, single, and alone. 

I do have Christmas day off from both my jobs and I just don't want to sit in my apartment all alone and just drink but at the same time, I dont know where I would go. This sucks."
497,How do I help myself and get away from these thoughts? Am I sick? Or just helplessly broken?,"Thanks in advance for the advice, it is appreciated."
498,Feeling Worse Suddenly,"Is it the end of a year thing? I screwed up life in mid-2018, kinda did nothing so far. And ppl i know are getting into med school, being recruited to another company, etc. I'm stuck in limbo.


At least i played video games before, but since the start of December, i think, the highlight of my day is going to my psychiatrist. I go as soon as i wake up, come back to my place and eat semi-lunch. I attempt playing games but i just stop after like 20mins into it, suddenly feel bad, and just put my head on the desk and try to block out the world w my arms. 



Then i feel worse and start crying while falling sleep until late afternoon. I wake up, do chores if there is sth to be done, and aimlessly do random shit on my pc then fall asleep. Without taking a shower. I'm someone who showers at *least* once a day. When i wake up at 5 AM, i feel disgusting and wash for half an hour, go back to bed and play light games on phone, fall asleep again until 9AM. Rinse and repeat.


Wtf is wrong with me. I'm 27 which should be the age where ppl are already several years into their real careers. I do nothing.


And all that comes to my mind is that i want to die. Failed twice (or more if i count the ones where no one saw me doing it) and im scared.

Im sick of feeling so bad"
499,I feel like every good thing means nothing anymore,"I think about when I was younger,  all the things I enjoyed and everything I used to do. Now all these things feel pointless - I can't find motivation for hobbies. I just sit in my room, mindlessly watching video after video, telling myself that soon I will go do the things i enjoy. But I never get up. When I'm with friends or family, it feels like I have to work extra hard to enjoy the moment, or it will go away, but if i ""work extra hard,"" I will just annoy the people around me until they leave. So I end up either completely silent, sulking about a lack of motivation, or over-compensating with an abrasive personality that I feel only drives people away. I'm completely aware of this dichotomy, and so to stop it, I refuse to touch the things/people I enjoy in fear of losing any joy I get from them, and by doing so lose any joy I get from them."
500,I need help..,"Hello this is a throw away account so nobody can harass me more 
I was in a discord a troll discord to be exact and I was just joking around with them when someone started to post my profile picture of my face into the chat (dumb idea to use a selfie) I’m really insecure and told him to stop and then it all fell onto me and I was called many racial slurs and such about my appearance I left that group thinking if I left they forgot about me.. a week later I joined back to see how everything is going and to my surprise they are still sending my selfie and now I’m accused of being a pedo  I went through an alt account and I told them why are they doing this they said “cause he is a pedo” I told them do they have proof and they say ask him (meaning me). And one of them said that my picture is very funny even though it’s just me staring into a camera.. I can not eat,sleep or do anything without the fallout of this cause I had my first and last name on that account and now I feel like they are gonna go after my Facebook 
I can’t get my mind off of this and my depression is getting worse and affecting my work quality..  one of the mods told him to knock it off with that but I doubt it’s gonna do anything..."
501,I hate when people ask why,"I know my husband means well but when I tell him I feel depressed or tell my mother I am always asked ""why?"". I don't have a reason why, do I need one. Sometimes I feel as though I have too good of a life to be depressed, and then I just feel even worse. It would be so much easier if I knew why, that would mean I could fix it, if it was only that easy."
502,I killed myself 29/11/19 and obviously failed,"20 days before my birthday, i failed and woke up 26hours later, benzo sad times"
503,I’m a disappointment,"I managed to pass three of my classes. I barely scrapped by with two C’s and an A in art. I just failed my Psych class. This is honestly better than I thought I’d do. I thought my A would be the only class I passed. I thought I did good. But now I’m curled up in my closet praying to god my dad doesn’t come in. I couldn’t handle my sister telling me what I did wrong after my mother told me what I did wrong. I cried for the first time in months, relapsed after 2 years of being clean, and now I just don’t want to hear it all again from my dad. I get it. We’re tight on money rn  and I’m just wasting it by failing. I already told them I’d be picking up a part time next semester and I’d reimburse them for the class. It’s just hard knowing I’ll always be such a dumbass, a disappointment, and a financial burden on my family."
504,Fuck Life,ok so I have to take Adderall because I can’t focus at school without it but it makes me more and more depressed each day and idk what to do. I mean I was already depressed in the first place but it makes it 10 times worse. I just hate myself and everything I do. I feel like I can’t do anything ever. But when I don’t take it I can’t remember anything. Then I just get yelled at by my parents for getting bad grades. I just feel like i’m only living to make others happy. I wish nobody cared about what I did so I could just end it now. I just wanna die...
505,a rant (then a poem),"i feel empty. i want to believe that im faking it for attention. i wish that was it.

i don't want to eat, i hate my body. it's fat and ugly. i still eat and i hate myself for it. there is harm in another slice of cake.

i cut for the first time today. it felt like i was free. i made them small and hidden so that i don't get caught. it feels like my secret, a forbidden comfort. like food. except i don't hate myself. i know i should hate myself. but i dont. i dont feel anything.

there's a boy in my school. he told me he's faking it. he pretends to like me. but he fakes it. his girlfriend broke up with him. he was ignored. he cut. he showed everyone his scars. he cut in class. i hate him. he is the reason people think depression is fake. i want to report him incase he really is suicidal but i cant. that requires talking to the counselor. i dont know her. i cant. i tried.

once upon a time an empty broken girl found a safety pin on the ground.

she had wanted to cut for a long time now, aching for freedom from the chains of sadness.

so she opened the pin (it was stuck)

she tried again (it opened)

she dragged it across her clean, waiting wrist.

it left white scratches.

no blood yet.

the empty broken girl wanted to draw blood but she couldn't.

she was too weak.

she watched the white fade to pink slivers

she hated it

and loved it.

she wants to stop

but can't

it feels good

she feels good

although she shouldn't.

thank you. i'm hopeless, don't bother answering. i won't kill myself yet. i'm not there yet."
506,Anyone feel like they have no direction and even if they did they couldn’t pursue it?,I feel like I’m going nowhere and even if i has the gas and car to I couldn’t ge there regardless
507,I'm up wanna chat,I didn't think I would live this long only 23 but been suicidal since age 8 or 9
508,I’ve been playing video games quite a bit more lately and I don’t know how to feel.,I’ve been struggling to feel motivated lately and have been less engaged in school. I still have 4 As and a B though.  The thought of figuring out what to do after high school has been a big stress for me and it has me feeling very under pressure. I’ve been turning to games because they are what I’ve normally turned to. I’ve never had friends really and games have always been there for me. I’m not an unfit person either though. Playing video games are the one thing that has given me motivation. I was wondering if it’s dumb to be passionate about video games. I used to play sports and do other things all through my junior year but now I’m a senior in high school. I guess to sum it up it’s just my game is the only thing I can really engage in and enjoy because I don’t feel all the other stress when I’m on it.
509,Help me please I don’t want to feel like this anymore,"Caught my wife at a hotel when she said she was at a friends house last week. She told me she didn’t want to be married to me and threatened divorce. Been rejected from every position I’ve applied to for my dream job. I’m in near constant pain and discomfort due to surgical complications. I just graduated college but the path I hoped to be on is falling apart.

I’m so lonely. My wife said she hated how stressed I’ve been, I don’t feel like I can talk to her. I dont really have friends anymore. 

I have a little two year old who I love more than anything. 

I’m so tired. I feel so awful. I don’t want this. Please. It hurts so much.  I can’t do this anymore. Why am I here, why do I have to be here. Help me please I dont know what to do"
510,I liked my crush but she liked my best friend,i really feel down and like im worth nothing rn. i really liked her and then she got with my bestmate... fuck sake
511,I couldn't fade away.,"I couldn't fade away. I couldn't just, disappear. I couldn't just painlessly dissipate for the good of everyone. There is no afterlife that would accept me, and I can't fathom to be with who I want to be with. The time is nigh. The paper walls collapsed. The whole house burned down. I can end my existence in the peace that I won't drag anyone with me. I am the root cause of my suffering, and I'll bring anyone else down who wants to be in my life. I'm literally just a lost cause desperately striving to redeem himself. Take me. Fucking take me already. Take me so I can leave it all behind. Take me while I feel peace. Before I get mowed down while striving for the ultimate answer."
512,I’m not made for this world!,"Around 4 years ago when I was around 13-14 years old I asked myself what’s the sense of living on this world. I literally don’t know why I should enjoy my life in this world. I believe many people found their reason to live, maybe marry get kids going to work, and paying the bills, or just later on marry the person that they love. So I just accepted that, and I didn’t thought about that further. Since around 2 years, I think I have depression, I literally don’t know, the last time I really was happy and enjoyed live, so yeah, obviously there are these good days that everyone has sometimes, somehow, but there nearly aren’t any good days anymore for me. I don’t belong here. I feel like is just motivated and enjoys live, and enjoys going to college, or to school, but not me! I just hate myself for existing on this world. I think I’ll drop out of school next year and I’ll do my own thing. I just don’t wanna be a wageslave and just going to work 9-5 all the day, coming home, watching tv for maybe 2 hours going to bed, and repeat, I don’t want to! I just hate people, and I think the world is fucked up. I hate myself for existing."
513,Where I'm at and how I got here.,"This is way too long.

I was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1992. Moved to Alberta when I was 1 and have mostly lived here since. In my first memories, from ages 3-5, things seemed okay, but never have since. I've spent so long trying to forget my life, and my childhoood especially so, but happy moments still stick out: bedtime stories, meeting our family dog for the first time, getting up early to watch cartoons on Saturdays, playing with lego/knex, playing with my older brother, digging in the dirt for worms while Mom gardened...

The rest of my childhood memories are dominated by my parents fighting. My first home was in suburbia, on a busy intersection, with nobody my age within walking distance. Because of the distances and the traffic, I didn't really get outside much. My Mom's family all lived in Ontario, and my Dad's family mostly lived across the province, so I didn't have extended family to connect with either. My whole social sphere consisted of: my two parents, and my two brothers (five years older, and five years younger). 

\_\_\_

About when I entered kindergarten is when things turned to hell at home. Mom and Dad started yelling and hitting each other, and drinking heavily, and slamming doors, and breaking dishes and saying vicious cruel things, and when I was a child that was my whole world. Fighting happened occasionally at first, and became more frequent until every time they were near each other they were at each others' throats. I know memory's faulty, but my best guess is that it happened on average once a week when I was 5, and four times a week by the time they finally separated 15 years later, with no peaceful interludes, just escalation. Mostly it was between Mom and Dad, but we all got dragged into it over the years. I remember my older brother fought my dad a lot. Really scary physical encounters because they were both pretty big. Sometimes my parents would leave the broken glass on the floor for hours, so I had to dodge the shards when I wanted a snack. When I was very young, the yelling felt like it was so big that there was no room for anything else in the whole world. It was louder than it was possible for a sound to be, and it scared me so much that it was coming from Mom and Dad. There weren't any other adults and nobody to help me understand.

I tried to stop it. I know now that was a mistake, but then I just knew I wanted it to stop, so I tried to stop it. That inevitably failed because I was 6 years old, (then 7, then 8, ...), and had a child's understanding of intent and emotion and the problems my parents were facing. Despite never getting the result I wanted, I did develop empathy, because that's naturally what will happen when you're trying to figure out a way to stop a fight from happening. If you can just intuitively connect with how someone feels, then you can see the causal chain that leads to the emotional breaking point, and then you can tell Mom and Dad about it, or step between them at the right moment, and they can stop fighting, and it can all stop hurting so bad. Oops. They kept fighting, but the empathy meant that I felt the hatred and fear and disgust more viscerally as time went on, and the pain intensified. I started to learn that I can't change important things in my life, because that was the only important thing in my life, and it was getting worse despite my (childish) heroics.

\_\_\_

Gaming is all I've had for large parts of my life. In the late 90s, Dad bought one of those old block Macintoshes from someone who had a bunch of games pre-loaded onto it (Apeiron, Swoop, A-10 Attack, Warcraft 1, Carmen Sandiego, and \~30 more), and that brought me a lot of comfort. While the family fighting continued, I started spending more time playing games. We got Windows, and I started playing Starcraft and Diablo. We got an Xbox, and I played Halo with my brothers and drifted around the Nurburgring in PGR4. These days I'm mostly playing TFT, Rocket League, and MTG Arena. 

\_\_\_

Music was never a refuge. My Mom was a great competitive piano player in her youth, but then her family had to move to accommodate her dad's job, and she had to give up piano. She made me play piano starting very young, and she vicariously played through me, and all my mistakes she felt as her mistakes. She hit me and yelled at me whenever I didn't live up to her impossible standards, and that sucked. Sometimes I just wanted to play, and create, and invent melodies, but that wasn't allowed because I could've been using that time to practice Sonata No. 343 in Fuck You Minor. When I was 14 I passed my Grade 8 RCM, finally stood up for myself, and quit. I still love listening to music, but I haven't played since. Never learned how to jam, or create, or to be joyful with it.

\_\_\_

School was never a refuge. All my classmates had gone to preschool and I hadn't; they knew each other already, they were building social skills already, and so I immediately felt like an outsider. I did make friends, but never felt close to any of them. Suburbia is social desert: no freedom, no long afternoons/nights spent romping through woods, or staring at stars, or catching bugs. All I had were rare, prescribed, well-organized playdates with approved friends at my house or their's, and I wasn't allowed to visit with girls or invite them over. 

None of my friends talked about their parents fighting, and nobody asked, so I never talked about it either. Gotta pay attention to social cues, right? I never had to convince myself not to, it just wasn't done. 

I always learned fast, and I guess that's a good enough reason to isolate a child. Instead of lessons with the class I was taken into a different dark room and I got to read higher-level books and do harder math. In return, my classmates rejected me, and I started to feel alone at school. In grade three my parents had me tested for giftedness, in grade four Mom homeschooled me for half a year, and then in grade five I moved schools, so whatever flimsy friendships I'd been starting to build were gone, done, over. Most of my first friends I never saw again after Christmas break in grade four, and I'm not in touch with any of them now.

In junior high and high school I made friends more easily, but I always felt alone. My world falling apart around me and no way to communicate it. No continuity. Home life never got better, but my grades didn't suffer until grade 12. The stress finally spilled over, and I broke down. I missed over half my classes in the second semester of grade 12 and failed all my courses.  Of course my parents thought it was just regular teenage hormones, my friends thought I was a jolly good laugh, and my teachers never even asked me if I was okay (why?), so I finished my last year of school adrift, with no plan for a future, no grades, no job, no work experience, no assets, no marketable skills, and HEY you're an adult now you're responsible for everything think fast!

\_\_\_

In my first year out of high school (Summer 2010 to Summer 2011), I sat in my Mom's basement and played videogames.  

The second year I started Comp Sci open studies courses at the local University, and did well. I liked programming, and I was good at it! My Mom moved neighbourhoods, and I went with her, and by chance some of my high school friends lived nearby. At age 20 for the first time in my life I could walk to a friend's house and visit without asking for a ride from Mom or Dad. We played DnD together and shared some amazing memories.

The third year, I'd moved out, was working a part time fast food job, still going to school part time, when one of my DnD friends killed himself. Sealed garage, music on, car on. Left a carbon monoxide warning note on the garage door. That shattered me. Lost my job, dropped out of school, started drifting again. Went to therapy for the first time, to deal with grief I thought. That's when I learned I was suffering from depression, too. Another friend's dad owned a small company in the Alberta oilsands, and after the suicide he hired me, which probably saved my life.

For two years, until Summer 2014, I worked in a camp up North three weeks on, one week off, fly-in, fly-out. I worked hard and I became strong. Camp life was good for me: I had a schedule, I earned the trust of my peers, we ate good food, and I learned I enjoyed working with my hands. There is a deep satisfaction in finishing a day of work and being able to see with your own eyes what you've built. This was the best period of my life, but the depression was ever-present in the background. My weeks off were miserable, and it was only when I was fully occupied that I was able to find some mental peace.

In summer 2014 I travelled outside Canada for the first time in my life to see the World Cup in Brazil, and that was wonderful. I stayed for five weeks, with no knowledge of Portuguese and only a backpack. I slept in a hammock on the banks of the Amazon river, kitesurfed over the beaches of Rio, and met an amazing woman from San Francisco, who I was privileged enough to date long-distance for two years. Even in Brazil, though, I had days when I couldn't leave my hostel because of depression. 

When I came back home to Canada I moved west to Vancouver with a vague intention to study Computer Science there. The company I was working with had finished the project and disbanded, so that wasn't an option anymore. I took my savings and moved, and without a solid plan wasted another year playing videogames. 

In fall 2015 I did start studying programming again, at a tech college. Staying busy let me ignore the depression, so I stayed busy. I was getting nearly perfect marks, was elected class representative, was taking extracurricular leadership courses, was feeling socially confident, had a girlfriend I loved with plans for the future, was getting out for hikes, eating properly, meditating, calling Mom to give her emotional support, and I had a part-time retail job. The divorce was still ongoing and my parents were eating through all their assets taking legal potshots at each other. 

This was too much at once, and I broke down in the spring semester of 2016. Stopped going to class, stopped answering my girlfriend's calls, stopped answering my door. Mom called the cops on me to make sure I wasn't dead. I had a summer job lined up with an IT company. Things were going to be okay, but I couldn't keep going. Mom drove out to bring me home, and I've been living with her since then. 

\_\_\_

Spring 2016 was three and a half years ago now, and I'm still here. I haven't had a job in over four years. I've been to therapy, group and private. I've taken a handful of different medications. With help, I've developed tools to help me deal with emotions, the ability to want things again, and a plan to join the Canadian Coast Guard. This fall I was upgrading some of those old high school courses so I could apply to the Coast Guard College, I was acing both, but I fell off the horse, and I don't think I can get back on. I can't keep convincing myself that it's going to be okay. I can't keep lying to myself and I can't force myself to try when failure keeps happening and keeps hurting. 

Through all the garbage of my childhood, I'd never had the energy or the need to understand the world at large, or where I fit into it. Now it's impossible to ignore, and it's the same shit I saw growing up, and that's devastating beyond words. We have destroyed the natural world as it once was, and the destruction of what remains accelerates daily. The attitudes of my parents are perfectly mirrored by the destroyers in their absolute unwillingness to admit wrongdoing or engage with the truth in good faith, and now it's too late. Temperatures will continue to rise, we will continue to burn fossil fuels, and eventually drought and famine will lead to migration, pestilence, and war, and billions will die. And again, just like when I was a child, these forces tearing apart my entire world are outside my control.

I just want to go home, but there's nowhere."
514,I cant decide if im activly or passivly suicidal,I have thyroid disease and im not treating it and hoping it willl kill me. Just tiered of being this boneless sad.
515,Haven't been happy in 3 years,"I've been suffering every day for 3 years straight, by good days are where I can laugh at all that is happening to me, it's been a year since I leave my room for something else that buying something I need, which can happen twice a month or not happen at all.

I used to be very happy, taught it would last for ever, let go people away thinking someone better would eventually take their place and now I'm all alone.

Always been a loner, is not that big of a deal, knowing my happiest days already passed and having the need to find joy in mundane things when I used to count the days for an special moment in the past is what's downs me.

After all this years I don't cry anymore and I'm stable and able to smile at how dumb I am, but the fact that the key to my ""good days"" is NEVER recalling how my life was is what is killing me today."
516,"My Brain: ""Oh boy 2 am the night before very important deadlines! Time to grapple with the meaning of existence, the threat of hell and Heaven, how suffering is eternal, and other philosophical/religious that have plagued mankind for millennia.""","""And I expect them solved by morning!"""
517,So tired of bullshit advice,"I try to open up to my friends about my debilitating depression and I really feel like the advice they give me is well meaning but terrible.

My one friend who claims to have been “depressed” in the past told me to “try changing my mindset and start thinking positive” while another advised me to “think of all the homeless people who have it way worse.”

I’m just so sick of it. I want to tell them how shitty their words make me feel but I can’t because I know it’ll just cause conflict. I truly feel like I don’t have anyone in my life who really understands. 

I don’t wanna hear about the knew vegan diet and how it cures mental illness. Or about how the Joe Rogan podcast changed your life. I just wanna fucking sleep and bond with someone who understands what a mental prison I live in. Jesus Christ. 

Sorry for the anger."
518,Therapist or psychiatrist,"I need some help. I don’t know where to start, can I get some advice, please?"
519,I wished none of you felt as shitty as you did,Because I know exactly what that's like and it kills me everyday.
520,Feels like writing another post to get this out of my chest,"I didn't get good/enough sleep last night after I had an argument with my mom. I'm an adopted daughter but never once in my life I felt adopted. The thoughts of that never crossed my mind and it seemed that I already forget of that fact until last night when she mentioned about it. How I should be grateful and remember where my origin is. The words hit me hard but I tried to look past it. However, this noon I just feel very horrible. I'm sad and I'm crying. With no other people to talk to I realise that I have to endure this all alone. What a horrible feeling to go through... I can't really describe it."
521,Im done.,"I’ve been trying so hard for so long and I keep thinking it’ll get better but how does it get better when you’re the problem? It doesn’t. Im stuck with myself and my mind and I’ll never escape. I don’t have any body, i lost all my friends. Either because I’m so difficult to be around or because they found better people. I called my boyfriend and like always he didn’t pick up. I feel completely numb. Im done."
522,Overwhelmed,Haye my job cant get enough sleep running myself ragged and now my truck my prized possession seems to have something wrong with it and I only have $20 dollars to my name it seems like life won't rest until it takes everything from me I'm so over this
523,Struggling with depression and crying while my SO sleeps soundly next to me,"I’ve struggled with depression for 20 years now but have managed to distract myself by being preoccupied with the needs of family and friends. I’m a people pleaser and constantly extending myself to help others, but self reflecting and trying to help myself has been too overwhelmingly painful and it is a challenge I have yet to face. 

This past week has been overwhelming. When I wake up, I dread going to work. But, bills have to get paid so I get up and go to work and look forward to coming home and going to bed. The last few days have been the same monotonous routine of sleep, work, sleep. 

I’ve been dating my SO for nearly 2 years now. I’ve shared with him my struggles with depression but he doesn’t take it seriously. He tells me depression isn’t real, that people who are “depressed” are just choosing to see things negatively. No matter how much I attempt to explain it, he doesn’t understand. 

I’ve been softly crying for the last two hours tonight, and he’s just been watching TV and basically ignoring me, telling me that it’s probably just a mood swing from PMS symptoms. Now he’s snoring beside me. 

I know it isn’t his responsibility to save me or be there for me, but I’ll never understand how someone can sleep next to the person they love while they’re hurting."
524,I'm so tired of trying.,"It takes monumental effort for me just to get out of bed, then any little thing after that is another challenge unto itself. I haven't done anything productive in so long, my body is falling to shit and I have ugly track marks from selling plasma, I don't have much of my mind left to lose but still feel like I'm losing it.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep struggling so much and end up getting nowhere for it. I'm ready to just give up."
525,I don’t want to see the headlines in 10 years,I don’t want to go into the resource scarce future. I don’t have a job and I spent most days trying to get up the energy to apply for one. I’m in constant physical and emotional pain (fibromyalgia). Both my life and the world will continue to decline in the coming decades and I have no hope that either my life or the world will halt their respective descents. I don’t know how to keep going in the face of both my own life and the brutality the world-system inflicts on its inhabitants every day.
526,feeling down and trying to open up to people.. not really working well,i have a hard time talking to people about my problems and i was texting my friend and it got kind of serious and i mentioned feeling alone and abandoned by my friends only to be responded to with “oh” .. i’m so tired. there’s no point. i just want to sleep and stop crying i don’t have anyone or anything my life is just sadness and fear and loneliness and emptiness
527,I just want to sleep.,"I‘m a lurker. Even talking online makes me anxious.

I feel like a NPC in my own life. I’m a low-poly garbled mess of pixels for someone to pass by. My AI is limited, and the things I should be able to do, I just do badly. Every decision I make seems to be the wrong one, so what’s the point in making any? 

I can’t sleep right now. I’ve got the sweats, keep grinding my teeth, feel this huge pit in my chest like I desperately want to cry but I can’t. I have no friends nearby, no family. Just an empty room and a fan on full blast that can’t cool me down or put me to sleep.

I don’t know when the meds are supposed to kick in. I initially convinced myself they were fake, that my psychiatrist figured I made everything up in a cry for attention and gave me fake pills to shut me up. I thought about taking them all at once to see if they’d even do anything.

I’ve lost everything and my physical health is in the dumps. I can hardly get out of bed, but when I do I get such an intense wave of nausea that I get right back in. I’ve been hiding inside for days. There’s no one I can talk to.

Sometimes I get the urge to just scratch my own chest open with my bare hands as if that would release some of the pressure. I know it sounds stupid. It seems hopeless now. The meds were supposed to help, I thought maybe for a minute I could get better.

I’m not very hopeful anymore."
528,"People say ""don't take your family for granted"" but I have one and still feel lonely and angry af","In fact, maybe they _are_ contributing to my loneliness by reminding me that even with them, this world is still cold, dark, and cruel."
529,I don't know what happened,I was feeling happy and energetic for a few days but today I woke up sad and tired
530,Spiraling into a worse depression because of my ex,I posted many times about my ex already but I can’t get over him. Has anyone else been through something like this that hits you so hard you don’t think you’re going to make it through? How do you get through this? My head keeps wondering why he chose another woman over me after 5 years. Someone told me it’s because she’s prettier than me and has a better personality. That made me even more depressed and want to die. I went to a mental health clinic yesterday and they kind of helped but my therapist said I should contact him and ask him for closure. I’m just scared of what he’ll say. He was so angry with me last time we talked. I miss my kitties too and I need the money from school loans to come through so I can pay pet deposit at my new apartment. My ex is taking care of my kitties and I was okay with that until I knew he was actually with the girl he cheated on me with. I’m so depressed right now and I feel like my whole life is ruined. I miss him so much and he doesn’t miss me I’m sure. I wish he would text me. I wish he would suffer like I’m suffering. Instead he’s happy and moved on without me.
531,My pain in intimate relationships.,"I don't expect anyone to read all this dumb shit, but I feel like typing this might help me. I don't have anyone to ramble to, so this is the only place I can speak freely. Plus I can look back on this post and flip flop between thinking I sound pathetic, and then the next week have it resonate with me again. I have never had an intimate relationship that has been worth it. I've always been picky, and as someone that could look a lot better, relationships in general are very rare for me. But when they happen, I feel emotions and happiness that I can't experience otherwise. I feel happy and complete, like I have someone to love for. This usually lasts the first month, maybe two if I'm lucky. Then it's all downhill. I'm no longer wanted despite doing everything I can for my partner. I'm never fucking good enough, I've always been replaced by someone else. Am I really that pathetic and disposable? Is everyone I've been with just a piece of shit or should I have seen things coming? What am I doing wrong? Anyone reading this probably thinks I sound like a whiny bitch and it's no wonder everyone is leaving me. It's not like that, at least I don't think it is. I've always been strong while in relationships. I think hard, speak strongly, and keep my fucked up emotions to myself when I have them, unless I feel like it's something that should be shared for the sake of the relationship. I try to guard myself and not get too attached but I can't. As much as I say I enjoy being alone, as soon as I get the slightest hint of attention, it becomes an addiction. They're all I think about, all I care about, and I would do anything to protect the relationship, but it always goes the same way. It took me almost 8 months to recover from my last relationship of 2 months. It's always the same. An ended relationship makes me feel pain that is indescribable. I feel like I literally can not breathe. I can't eat. I can't move. All I can think about is distracting myself or dying. It's not worth it, it never has been. I've become terrified of females, and any sexual thought is now a trigger. I'm fucked up and I don't know what to do about it or if I'll ever feel love again. So what do I do now? Improve myself right? I've tried. Exercise, diet, friends, socializing. Sure it helps, but nothing comes close to the happiness I've felt in a relationship. Why the fuck can't I keep myself happy when I'm alone? So then comes that craving for someone to love, and the cycle starts again. I bought a gun a week ago, originally for self defense, but all I can think about is putting it to my head. I don't think I'd ever pull the trigger though. It would upset too many people, and I have too many things left in life to complete. But I think about it, and what's worse is that it should bother me and it doesn't. I've always been a bit suicidal, but I've never tried anything, always just thought about it. But having that gun by the bed, I can't stop looking at it. Maybe it's just because I like the damn thing. It's mechanical, it's precise. It's very real. But it's entertaining to think about how one pull of the trigger is all it would take. There's one already in the chamber, meant for someone who intends to hurt me, but I guess that could end up being me right? What the fuck is this. I feel like I'm going insane. Doctor put me on some meds. Asked if I wanted to bump them up last week and I said no because I thought maybe I was doing better. Certainly not. I hate feeling like I'm on meds too. How am I supposed to know which emotions are mine and which are coming from the medicine? I can't stop thinking about things I don't want to think about and it makes me feel weak. Sometimes I wish I could just break and go full psycho, but there'd be no going back. Here's to hoping I can go snowboarding this weekend to just let go and give myself something to do. Anything to distract, like writing this post that my parents would throw me in a hospital room for. Fuck it."
532,25 and Alive,"This is a short post but I feel like sharing. I don’t want want to come off as bragging or to let anyone think I have it so easy. I know mental illness can feel like an inescapable trap but I have to believe recovery is possible. Even on the worst days. 
It’s been on my mind that we are nearing the end of decade. For me and my battle with depression has been a decade of uncertainty. I was diagnosed in 2010 at 15 also known as the worst year of my life. During that time, I was in so much pain and so sick I didn’t think I’d make it past 15. I crawled out of that year half dead but just enough in me to fight. For a few years I was fine mostly surviving and healing. In 2017,  I relapsed into depression that made everything touch and go. Again I barely crawled out of that but where I am now compared to then is such an achievement. I’m actually healthy for the first time. I’ve lost a lot, sometimes it was my choice other times it wasn’t. Still I made it an entire decade and it’s pretty cool."
533,Stuck in a loop,"I need money to pay my bills but my mental health is terrible so I don't want to work. 

I want to fix my mental, but I need money for therapy.

My anxiety is so high I can't stop grinding my teeth at night and I'm not sleeping well at all. 

I need to go to the dentist, doctor, therapist, pay my bills and maybe find a way to have some kind of christmas on top of it all. 

I feel like my mental health has to be put first at this point or I'm going to wind up in a really bad place. But without the money to do so idk what options I have left. 

I'm ready to just shutdown all together. Lay in bed and wait until my world crumbles down around me. 

FUCK"
534,"trying to put on a happy face, it just isn’t working anymore","I’m so tired. I’m so tired of constantly battling my health, my mind, my family. I thought I was doing okay. I thought I could do it, I could have a job, I could go to school. I could get off my medication, away from my abusers, and into a new life filled with happiness and health. 

I can’t. I can’t I can’t do it anymore. I feel so fucking needy. Talking to people seems more lonely than just being by myself. I want my meds. I don’t want to feel this. I don’t want to hurt. I feel like such a waste of space and resources. 

I know talking like this is just reaffirming these beliefs but I don’t know what else to do. hiding it doesn’t seem to be doing any good, and it’s not like it’s hidden very well anyway. 

I just need help"
535,So tired of life. I just want to give up.,I dont know where to start. I just turned 27 today.  I live with my fiancee and our almost 2 yr old son. Our house and bills are paid off by my fiance's mother. She also gives us money every week that we live off of. Everyday it's just me and my fiancé and son hanging out in the house especially since its winter here. We just got our son back after a year long DCF case while my fiancé was also in prison at the same time. Going through that all alone was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do. I feel like I've walked through all 9 circles of hell. But I fought like hell and never gave up. While things have definitely improved since then and seem to continue to improve I still cant shake these depressing thoughts i have as well as anxiety about the future. I just keep coming to the same thought that I am tired of living. I'm just so tired of everything. No amount of sleep is enough when I have to keep waking up to do the same chores everyday and cook meals while trying to keep everyone happy all the time. I just want to stay in bed and never leave. Going out to do things doesnt help. I dread leaving the house. It's too much work getting everyone ready. I'm paranoid about someone judging me and reporting us to DCF again. I have seen a therapist who told me I was not depressed that I was just going through a rough time and had a good head on my shoulders. The plan was for me to be a SAHM but now my fiancé is unemployed and with a criminal record so it's very difficult for him to find work. I dont have a license and have severe driving anxiety and PTSD from a car accident I was in. My therapist told me if I didnt feel safe driving then I shouldn't do it but it doesnt make me feel like any less of a failure. I have never been employed. I feel like having more independence and financial security would help my anxiety. I completed cosmetology school just barely due to my anxiety. I would hide in the bathroom and pretend to be sick when it was my turn to take a client because my anxiety was so bad. I did discover a talent and passion for nail art during that time and have recently started doing it as a hobby again. I would need much more practice to become good enough to provide services worth paying for. I think often about offering nail services at my house to generate income. But that's kind of just a pipe dream. Sorry for the long post. Felt good to get all this off my chest.
536,A week til Christmas...,"And my employer (I’m contracted) hasn’t paid me my last 5 invoices.
I can’t get gifts for my partner and family. I can’t even pay rent.
I just feel so... Done. 
Anybody else feel like it’s just one thing after another? I can never seem to catch a break lately. I feel like a failure. I don’t know how to get myself back on track. 
I have the best partner in the world, I’m so lucky - but I feel like they’d be so much better off without me at the moment. I can’t even look her in the eyes today. She’s gone above and beyond and got me so many amazing gifts, it’s our first Christmas together and I was counting on being paid to be able to get her something. I can’t believe this has happened. I know gifts aren’t everything and that’s the least of my overall worries but I just feel like such a failure and disappointment.

Thanks for letting me vent, sorry if this isn’t well written or if it makes so sense, first time posting here and I’m on mobile. - I guess I just needed to vent somewhere and I’ve recently realised I don’t have many friends so I guess reddit is the next best place to let it out."
537,i’m just alone,"no friends, nobody cares about me. i used to befriend loners, but get ditched when they find better friends. i see others with friends that have their back, getting angry on their behalf, while i have nothing like that. i don’t mind not having friends but it must be nice to have someone who gives a shit about you i guess"
538,People actually look forward to the new year?,"I just sat before my boss and HR manager and they said if was looking forward to the new year and all of the possibilities. I said no, and asked why I would, or if I should. They looked at me and said they were excited to get stuck into a few year, and...I truly don't see their perspective. Looking forward to WHAT? It's just another year with the same tasks, due dates and disappointment. And before we know it, it'll be over again. I truly don't see what they see and I don't know who the fool is. But they looked moronic to me with their brainless grins. I see nothing and that's my normal. How can I ever find a new job when I can't even fake normality at my current one? I can't be like them."
539,i can't stand being alive,"i used to be maybe the most vibrant person ever no matter what but now i not only can't stand being alive but also hate sleeping so all i do is just nothing but listening to music as you guess the depressive ones

not being cared up to 5 months ago i didn't know how to act so i gave everything i have to the person who cared me but i didn't know that he was able to leave me as well

he was my boyfriend my brother my father my close friend and etc now all i have is nothing

the hardest part of this situation is we are living in the same house due to the fact that my father kicked me out from home (again)

my ex bf said you can stay here as much as you want and i will give money how much you need don't worry you will get used to seeing me everyday it's not that a big deal

which made me crazy because he is not stupid but cannot underrstand he was my everything and his even sleeping next to my room and my can't cuddling him kills me

everybody here knows that suicide is giving up everything

i can give up everything my life my friend my ""family"" but him

i can't give up even his existing 

this is the second time we broke up and as he said the reason is our relation-ship is unhealthy but he s still loves me -as he said-

the thought that he would be sad in case of my killing myself making me extremely sad 

what the hell should i do 

i have nowhere to go

 guess i just want to give up him as well and kill myself because i can't stand it anymore"
540,Some good news finally!!!,"I found a remedy that helps me I kniw it’s probably not the best but it’s pretty effective as of now smoking weed.
I know as a 14 kid I shouldn’t and it has a lot of bad effects but I don’t get that emptynesd feeling in my stomach as much I’m exercising more and on rare occasions I’m in a good move I’m going to stop smoking for awhile and see if I become more depressed or not I’ve also set back the date for me to kill myself from Christmas to unknown I still want to die a little but right now life is worth living for me
It gets better U/‘s it does even if you think it never will happen once you hit rock bottom there is only one place to go"
541,Just conquered one of my fears tonight!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,"Yeiiiii, sooooooooooo damn proud 😎💕"
543,I have been,Carried my entire life and you know what I will continue to be maybe even for the rest of it. I’m too stupid
544,Missing my dog- having a hard time,"I moved in with my boyfriend last year, meaning I moved out of my parents house where my dog is. They live close and I see them often, but it isn't the same, and with my boyfriend traveling for work a lot I end up spending a lot of time and a lot of nights alone. I want a dog so badly, I miss the constant companionship. I also miss the responsibility of having to take care of something other than myself, some days letting the dog out was all that got me out of bed. I would get a dog of my own, but things with my boyfriend are bad lately, and my parents can't have another dog in the house if I end up having to move back in with them. Thinking about how much a dog would help me makes me more sad because I know getting one just isn't an option right now."
545,I need help..,"So guys, I’ve been dealing with depression lately on and off. I’m not sure what to do next, I’m unemployed and can’t seem to find a job anywhere. Most nights I just sit and feel like crying every night, I have a very loving girlfriend that supports me and when she’s around I feel like a different person. The only time I feel normal. When I’m alone I just sit and overthink to the point where it makes me depressed. I’m just at a dead end, I feel like an absolute nobody. I feel like I’m a burden on everyone. This is not a pity post, I need help and advice from others."
547,Feel guilty ish for not taking meds ?,"last few months for me have been crazaaaaaaaaayyyy. I had pyschosis for few months after taking magic mushrooms. I feel like now im just starting to get better. But now that im just starting to get better, my nurse wants me to go on meds. But they didnt want me to go on meds when I had horrible pyschosis ? I'm scared meds will fuck me up, but idk if they will magically make me even better ? Ugh life is confusing. 

I also feel bad relying on something to make me happy , i find if i eat right / gym / meditate i can manage my depression alright, its not amazing or anything though. idk anymore"
548,how do i dig myself out,"i think i've been in a semi burnout for the past couple years, say since 2012, then was ending a long stretch(say from 18 to 40) of too many happy hours ending at 5 am with burning sinuses, molly, terrible alcohol hangovers, long stressful work days, rinse, repeat, work hard, play hard typical bs... I stop going on that roller coaster, diminished my alcohol consumption to a normal level since then.

hooked up with someone thinking this was my last chance of getting my shit together, having a family, etc...  turned out starting a long term relationship with a nose candy lover was not the best idea for me, ignored a lot of red flags(lying, manipulative behavior, etc).  

First very obvious red flag was like 5 years ago she started to threaten to make false accusations about domestic violence(i would never ever do anything like that, never have, never will) if i did not do what she wanted, i packed my stuff right then and almost left (should have, but everything is obvious in hindsight ..), i didn't, fell for the tears, the promises, chose to be weak, selling my house seemed like a nightmare added to a nightmare...

Thing were not so bad for the next 2, 3 years maybe but then she started indulging again with her sister.  Then again with the threats, the last year of our so called relationship i recorded her every time i saw that glare in her eyes, those drunk aggressive wino coked up glassy eyes, just in case she got crazy enough to actually call the cops and try to get me evicted from my own place...

any who, long boring story, sorry about that, in the end, maybe a month before we split she started to make death threats(by poison, she works in labs), so yeah i figure that was it, i could not keep my head in the sand anymore... a couple weeks later she started again with the threats of calling the cops on me (i filmed that last night) but that time she had gotten too high and drunk that when the coke wore off she fell asleep on the bathroom floor. i saw my window of opportunity right then, filled my car with whatever i needed to work the next week, fled to a friends place for a couple months, got rid of the house, never spoke to her after we signed the papers for the house.

Problem is, i m left alone, in my late forties(was 45 when i left), lost contact with most of the friends outside of work, not all though, so i should consider myself lucky, she hated everyone i hanged out with so like any plants, friendship you don t nurture will wither away...

My life is pretty good on paper, good health, decent job, no debt, higher middle class where i live, got my own place, car, travel, etc  

A walking depression they call it i think.

Reality is, i am not good, got all this ptsd anxiety looming, poisoning my thoughts, sinking my self esteem, feeding this anger against myself.  

Went to talk therapy and eventually figured out that i lived in constant fear after that first episode of false accusations threat, lived in fear of the next crisis for a couple of years after, afraid to act, to live.

i m not dead yet, probably wont die until my time comes, but i do feel like i m wasting my time trying to be happy..."
549,Isolation is the worst part,"As I sit here 6 hours into my shift, with nothing to do and no one to talk to. I just feel this awful sense of Isolation and loneliness. I have burnt bridges with friends, ruined my marriage, and am left with nothing. No one cares what I am feeling, and when I try to reach out to the only people I know. I'm brushed away. 

I spent much of my life feeling like a burden, unwanted, and unloved. Then I was show what real love was, what it was like to be cared for. It changed me. I don't know how to deal with this now. I don't know how to cope with this immeasurable pain i'm feeling. All I want to do is walk out of this building and find a quiet place to die. How can I keep moving forward when i feel like I'm weighed down by this great emptiness? It's just all getting to be too much now, and I'm struggling. There is no one to talk to anymore and I just don't know where to turn."
550,My story,"I just made this account as some sort of vent release or whatever you want to consider it. So here we go. (Mobile formatting)

Obligitory backstory: I was an odd 3-7 year old to begin with, I never really had friends. I was the one that always was by myself. (recess, arts and crafts, etc.) I always played with my toys, never shared them, never used anyone else's.

When I was 8 though, things got more apparent. My mother has terrible back problems (not really important) and severe anxiety and depression. And my dad has bad bipolar disorder. Due to depression, my mom gained weight, lost self confidence, didn't go out much, etc. etc. So when I started to not want to do anything, period, they got worried. It only gets worse. 9 was a pretty steady year, nothing too bad, talked to some kids, had around 2-4 friends at school. Basic elememtary school year. But 10 years old was probably the worst year so far. I lost all energy, I could not bring myself to do anything. Getting out of bed took any energy I had that day. I would have panic attacks daily. And everytime I would attempt to communicate with someone, I would get chills and I would stutter. (never had a stuttering problem) So my mom and my dad took me to see a child psychologist, which almost immediately after about 20-25 minutes of talking to me had concluded that, 1. I had bipolar, (undetermined how bad at the time) 2. I had clinical depression, (one of my friends killed himself at 14, and my older brother, 17, died in a car crash. Same year.) And 3. I had social and panic disorder. So I was a pretty fucked up 10 year old. I started seeing a therapist which didn't do much help, and to this day doesn't. A few months later, I had turned 11, and I cut myself for the first and only time, Nothing serious. Nothing much else happened since then. I'm now 12, get reoccurring suicidal thoughts, and panic attacks every other day, and still have no friends in real life. Everyone always told me, ""you're faking it."" Or, ""you're too young to have depression, stop trying to get attention."" And my personal favorite, ""stop acting like you're depressed, you're 12, just because you're sad one day doesn't mean you have depeession, [insert homophobic slur here]."" And it makes me even more insecure about telling people, especially hundreds (probably thousands...) seeing this post. I was told by my therapist to try to find an outlet for venting pent up emotions. And I'm gonna be honest, I'm getting chills writing this, but it makes me feel a little bit better, getting to tell my story and express myself. So if you found yourself reading this, thanks for taking the time to get to know my story."
551,I'm on vacation and still feel depressed,"It's weird, I've been in Hawaii for the past 3 days already and the environment is beautiful. The air is pure and fresh. And the food is breath taking. But I still feel so down always. Like every visit I do feels like a drug: a momentary and small happiness. But on the road, walking, in the hotel, basically anytime I'm not experiencing something new; I'm full of negative thoughts. Thoughts of guilt, shame, anger, and pure sadness. I already take antidepressants, I have a therapist. But this was supposed to be a fun and exciting vacation to get away from it all. I don't know what to do."

553,Depression trigger has gone but the effect still lingers,"Hi. I'm currently working as an IT professional, and was diagnosed for major depressive disorder by therapist and psychiatrist due to some things that happened at life and got worse at work. I managed to stay in the team of 10 for more than a year, with nearly 1-2 person was resigning and coming every month. The conflict in communication and management style used to make me having severe anxiety attack and depressive episode. My confidence shattered to pieces, to the point that I thought people will tolerate death better than the mistakes I did. Finally, after reflecting on how everything was affecting my health and decided to pick up my slack for good, I was about to quit this particular job at the end of this year. I got another job lined up at the moment. So I thought that's supposed to be a good thing? The management is also try to improve things, and the trigger is pretty much gone, though I still decided to quit to start over. Next year I'll be moving from big company to a smaller start-up.

I should be--at least--happy, i guess?

However, I didn't feel any joy or happiness. All I can feel is emptiness (what an irony), guilt, and fear of repeating the same mistake. Sometimes I'd second guess my decision, thinking whether it is a good move or not. My confidence hasn't returned yet, and that doesn't really help. I used to be on medication and therapy for a year or so.. but have stopped both of them abruptly since couple months ago because I'm so tired of the process. Besides, I don't think meds could help if the problem is actually situational. Or so I thought. It also affects my memory badly, that I easily forget things which cause a lot of problem at work.

I used to be highly motivated (though not too ambitious) and could happily get my hand into many things. But now I'm just feeling meh. The suicidal thought isn't as strong as it used to be. But still, it's pretty much like living in a limbo. Sometimes I missed my old self and can get really depressed to know that I'm not as capable as I used to be.

Is that all make sense? Or was it just in my head? Is it going to be better? I don't even know what I'm expecting from writing it all here. But I guess I'd like to hear some opinions from the other perspective."
554,Does anyone else think suicide prevention chats don't work?,"Throughout my 18 years of life, I have been to the suicide prevention website atleast 50 times. The first time was when I was 8. However I have never fully been able to contact anyone. There are always atleast 50 people ahead of me, so I end up waiting longer than 30 minutes to get to my turn. When I am finally through I have to then fill out ANOTHER form and wait until the person on the other end messages, but they never do. I have waited an hour on multiple occasions to speak to someone, and have to this day, never got ahold of anyone. 

I can't call the hotline because I will most likely be overheard by my family and caught, and if they don't catch me there is a camera outside my door that will. So the chat is my only real option, but it never works."
556,A vicious cycle,"Stay in bed most of the day because you have no energy. Get up and do a couple things, need to go back to bed but now just spiraling thinking about all the ways you wasted the day, so you have to pop sleeping pills so you can try and go to work tomorrow. Fun."

559,I wish I wish I had a cold,"Okay so when I was a kid, my parents always said ""when you're a adult you can choose not to go "" but that's not the case if I don't go to Christmas I need a excuse.  I don't want to go, I'm sick of being compared to my cousins (that weredealt way different hands than me) and I DON'T wanna go. Plus I feel like crap and laying in bed watching TV is really appealing to me any day, especially Christmas.

I wish I had a cold,  because it's not like I can say ""sorry can't make it I'm depressed ""."
560,I feel ungrateful,"I feel so spoiled and ungrateful for being depressed. So many other people live such happy lives with less advantages than I’ve had. So many people on this sub are facing super daunting challenges, and I feel like I don’t deserve to feel depressed. I’m just ungrateful and lazy, and Instead of blaming myself for being lazy, I’m just blaming depression, that maybe I’m making up. I don’t even know anymore. None of this makes sense. I just want all of this pain to go away, but there’s no light anymore. Every day is getting harder. I’m such a burden. I’m sorry for writing so many posts, I just don’t have anyone that I trust enough to tell all of this to."
561,I feel more unwanted the more people tell me they want me,"I know it sounds weird, but recently I've opened up to a few friends about how I've been feeling. But they just tell me the basic cheesy stuff, and they really like telling me I'm wanted in this world, but the more i hear it the more i don't believe it. it doesn't make sense, i know, but that's just how i am.

(you can stop here if you want, the rest is just a rant about family) 

Just ten-twenty or so minutes ago, I was telling my dad, the one person in my family i brag most about saying things like ""he cares about me more than the rest of my family"", about something i think is really cool. I was telling him the story of the Evelyn, Evelyn twins. Midway through my story my brother came home, and immediately we stopped and said hi to him because we love him, but then i continued with my story. all of a sudden my dad interrupts me to talk to my brother. I figured no big deal, but then a few minutes went by and I realized my dad didn't care about what I was saying. that really hurt, because everyone thinks my brother is better than me and my dad was the only one who ever gave me the chance to talk and he didn't only care about my brother, but i don't know. the more i think about it the more i realize how he probably does care more about my brother. sorry that was long, but i don't really have anybody to talk to about it and i just needed to vent"
562,Discharge from outpatient,"I’m 17 and my insurance will only pay through December 23rd for my therapy. I’ve been in an outpatient program for 9 weeks  and I feel like I haven’t made any progress, I’m still suicidal I still self harm and I still hallucinate. Am I letting my family down by not getting “better” I’m just so done with this shit. 

I’m really just venting here"
563,I can’t breathe,I don’t want to talk about it but I don’t want to feel this way.
564,How to find the right therapist,I’m looking to find a therapist but I’m not sure how to find the right one. Just looking for some tips.
565,I’m done,"I hate life. It’s always the same damn thing. School, home. School, home. School, home. IT NEVER CHANGES. And I hate how stressful school is, and how when I come home, all I get is criticized and put down by my mom and I’m sick of it. I hate her, and my life.  There’s so much more but I can’t think rn"
566,Is resistance to cold a side effect?,"It’s winter where I am, around 2 to -2 centigrade or 35.5 to 28.5 degrees Fahrenheit. I am usually snot that cold resistant, but now I’m getting hot wearing a pullover and a t-Shirt. Is this normal? Everyone who sees me being outside with that clothes thinks I’m crazy."
567,i know no one will read this and that’s okay,"but i really just need to get this of my chest. life, you constantly knock me down, beat me up and throw dirt in my face. you make me hate myself and everything i’ve become, you make me forget the person i once was and what it feels to be happy, you make me an empty shell with nothing to live for. you love destroying my relationships and my interests. but there’s something you won’t destroy, and that my hope, i hope of a better future, a better life, and to feel something once again, maybe to even fall in love and love somebody as i can’t love myself. i hope things will change. although you knock me down each day and each hour you will never fully burn out the flame in my heart to reignite the fire to want to live and be happy again."
568,Recurrent Brief Depression,"Warning for anyone who might be triggered or set off by depressing topics. Please don't fuel that flame. 


It's like a loop I'm caught in, can't explain, can't control. I'm okay, doing what I have to do in life, and then a wave of grief and numb and feeling down hits me and I question if I've ever been happy. I shut everyone out, even the people I'm closest to, and they don't understand why. I don't feel hungry, or have any desire to get out of bed. It makes the people around me mad and I just don't have the will or words to break out of my shell during these episodes. 

To be fair, I haven't seen a professional regarding this. I plan on doing so through my university's services in the Spring. I think I can last until then. It's been two years of depressive episodes every 30 or so days, lasts a few days to two weeks, and I'm just not myself. 

I've always had this bug in me, like something was just twisted the wrong way when I was young and I've never had it corrected, there's something wired into me that will always bring me back to this state of being down, no matter how much I build up successes in my life. It all boils back down to this.

I don't know why I'm sharing this here. I guess because I don't know where else to say it. I've told some of the people I'm close to about what I'm going through, but I'm just a broken record about it at this point, so I don't want to keep venting to them. It's late now anyway, no one is awake probably. 

I know I'll wake up in the morning, I'll go to work, I'll do what I need to do around the house after, I'll eat. I'll prepare for school next semester. I'll pay bills. But that's all I can bring myself to do now. What I have to do. Until maybe it all gets better, or I crumble under the weight of trying to mask what's going on in me. 

thanks for reading. im sorry if this triggers anyone's problems."
569,relieved,"i just let my friends go. 

i'm not sure if they will hate me now or become friends with me again, but i'm relieved. 

i can finally let them go without being so stressed anymore. 

i really cherished the times that we were friends. 

but now, i feel like i can finally move on."
570,"Things are finally looking up in life, but I can't help but put myself in a negative headspace","Very likely that I'll get a decent job and about to graduate.  Friend just gave me a monitor that works very well and a mouse.  I feel terrible right now because I'm still focusing on the possibility I don't get the job, haven't figured out living situations, and most importantly being pessimistic (realistic) about relationships.  I've stayed on reddit for hours now just trying to find stuff to get me mad, like people talking about relationships.  Also been listening to more depressing music and avoiding work. 

I've just been feeling so anxious and there's some type of pull that keeps me from looking away at the things I don't want to see.  It's like my inner self believes that I can eventually solve the issues if I keep staring at it, but my more conscious self knows that even if I could solve all my problems, staring at them in the middle of the night won't help.

I feel like I'm one bad day away from either being an incel, committing suicide, or just being a shut in.  Although, being a shut in and just gaming all day is my short term goal.

I hate the self pity I've nurtured in my brain, but also can't help but letting it smother me.  It's like an addiction."

573,Do sertraline side effects wear off?,"Starting taking (prescribed) sertaline 50mg yesterday. In the side effect lucky dip I got diarrhoea, orgasm difficulty and insomnia- went to bed at 1, woke up at 4:30. Are these expected to be ever present whilst im on the medication ( planned 6 months)."
574,i think i feel this unreality so much because my ears always feel like they need to be popped,"i’m getting a lot of my regular sense of touchness back and that made me think about what i’m hearing

and boy oh boy i think it has a lot to do with that. like when you’re riding up by the mountains and your ears plug up. or a plane ride. etc etc. 

gonna try to explain this to my therapist when i next see her"
575,(slight TMI) Has anyone had bad cramps after coming off antidepressants?,"This may be slightly TMI, but i'm curious to see if anyone has had similar experiences.

So after a bad period of anxiety, I went to my nearby mental health clinic for care. Literally after two sessions where I got some brief counselling and explained my symptoms, they handed me a prescription for Paxil (which is, as I've learned afterwards, pretty hard on the body) and for Xanax and told me to come back in a month. Yeah, I live in a country with pretty shit free options for mental healthcare.

I took the Paxil for about a month and some change and tossed the Xanax prescription- I have a history of substance abuse of my family and wasn't gonna trust myself with unlimited benzo access lmao. I had a reallll nightmare of a time, body numbness, jaw tension, insomnia, emotional detachment, loss of libido, the works. I came off it after a little while because it just wasn't worth the hell my body was going through. 

Immediately after coming off of it, I realized it had really whacked my cycle- it's normally pretty regular, but all of a sudden it was really random and all over the place. And oh lord, the cramps. I've never had really had bad cramps or PMS, but all of a sudden I was experiencing full blown moodiness and irritability pre-shark week and HORRIFIC cramps. The type of cramps that make you violently ill, where you sweat, tremble and sob, where you beg God for forgiveness because clearly you've done something to wrong them.

I have NEVER experienced anything like this in my life before. Normally I get mild cramping for a day and that's it, but now it's literal torture. Have any other girls experienced something similar from taking/coming off antidepressants??"
576,Having a hard time trying to forgive,"I grew up with dysfunctional parents. In a lot of moments of my life my own dad worked on destroying what little self-esteem I had/have. My dad played both roles that has left me in this crazy state of confusion. One moment he'd be encouraging me and helping and then the next he'd switch to treating me down. His character is way too confusing for me. I don't trust him like I used to as a kid. As a kid he was like my hero but when I got older and grew into my ownperson I started to see controlling ways about him. He'd purposely try to sabotage me in certain things or discourage me from following my dreams. He quotes bible scriptures a lot and then the next he's speaking against it. He has never really followed through on any of his promises and I learned at a young age that he is unreliable. He is super critical of me and very judgmental towards others. One minute he tells me something then the next he's saying the total opposite. It's just I could never tell where he stood. In a way I feel a bit brainwashed by him. I feel that my life has been so controlled and manipulated by him that I might need therapy for post traumatic stress disorder and sometimes I want to cry because I want to ask God, why me? I live my parents but why did I have to be born through a parent like him? I used to think nothing but good things about him but then I started discovering a dark side to him the older I got. My mom on the other hand says the most cruel things to me when she's mad. She's called me a Satanist, lucifer and her favorite ""#6"". My mom has called me wicked, a b*tch, and she's brought up the fact that I wasn't married yet and tried to make me feel really bad because of it. I'm basically 30 and still living with my parents. It's not their fault Im still living with them but I don't know why but in a way I feel trapped with them. I don't have any where else to go and one time my dad was talking money out of my safe. Just thinking of all these terrible things makes me feel so tempted to hate them for what they did to me and they are a part of the reason why I'm so messed up right now. I want to be able to forgive them for good and move on with my life but I find myself thinking back on all of this and it just makes me so angry. I have personally never known any friends or family members of mine who's mothers have talked to them the way my mother does when she's mad. To be honest I'm at the point where i feel like i don't even wanna be here anymore. I feel like my life is kinda pointless. None of my famil comes to see me or visit me i feel like most of my youth was wasted by all of my parents wants and needs from me and me taking on their negativity. It's so very hard living with them I'm always trying to talk my mom out of thinking negatively but then she turns on me and accuses me of things and then calls me all kind of names. My mom is kinda wishy washy with her feelings. I'm starting to wonder if she's borderline or has narcissistic personality disorder too. I really don't know what to do and I just feel like my head has been screwed over. I sometimes wish that I had different parents because it seems like they know nothing about real love like they don't know what love is. And in a way I don't know if I even know what that is either. I don't know if others believe in GOD or not but I do, but I can't see what God's purpose was for creating me in such a life as this. I don't feel loved and i feel isolated by the whole world by everyone including family and friends. I don't even know how it got to this point. I feel like living with these peoplehave really stunted my growth and I feel very childlike all the time. My dad always tried to get me to depend on him for everything. Now i just have a lot of resentment and depression."
577,Is it ok to form local irl support groups on here?,
578,I became the person I swore to strike out of my life,"My ex. That guy who contributed to my turning into a fucking moron.

He was aggressive, controlling and manipulative. Rarely I saw him genuinely having fun. There were times when he felt very exhausted and down, and he tried to commit suicide one day.

While I understand exhaustion, apathy and suicidal behaviour, I couldn’t cope with three first trait of him and left.

And now, after 16 months since breakup passed, I realise that I’m exactly like him.
For a week or two I’m VERY active, aggressive, egoistic, toxic and manipulative and thinking about suicide in order not to hurt others. And the other two weeks I desperately need attention and care while constantly having pictures of me jumping from somewhere cause it hurts me too bad.

What a fucking mess"
579,My BF might break up with me because of my mother,"So I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and we have a long distance relationship going on, my mom is a helicopter parent and it stresses him out like he can’t have good alone time with me even though we’re both adults (19-21). But he can’t take it any,ore and doesn’t want to be with me because my mother is like this, it’s not even my fault this is happening, I don’t want to lose him and I won’t have any where to go if I lost him.
He’s always been the light of my life but I can tell he doesn’t love me anymore, why do I have to suffer for my mother’s actions? Why can’t parents realize they’re ruining their kids lives by doing stuff like this?"
580,Cant get out of this hole,"I fell out of my routine and cant find my way back. It seems any chance I get to put something unhealthy in my mouth I jump to it. Lately I've been unmotivated to cook food, eat healthy or exercise.

There is just so many things driving me down in life. I separated from my ex (which was a good thing) but now anything and everything I do for or regarding our son is a battle. I'm constantly labeled as a bad parent, told my son has no respect for me and that I am mentally unstable and unfit to be a mother. Despite being the one who does everything for our son and him only stepping foot on my property 3 times this year. 

My father is likely going to die early next year or cancer (hes 65) I'm (28). 

My auntie is dying of kidney failure and lung cancer.

And SAD is hitting me like a bunch of bricks.

Honestly I'm a mess and I just want to curl in a ball and die....

I just want to find myself again"
581,"I'm considering extreme self-harm, and I can't talk about these thoughts with anybody I know in real life","My depression is caused by panic disorder. I'm having thoughts (only thoughts, no planning) of extreme self-harm, like cutting a finger off type stuff. I don't want to die, but I want the emotional pain to go away. 

I have a friend/ cousin who told me I can talk to them about this type of thing, BUT, I had a major depressive episode earlier this year where I talked with them a lot about mental illness stuff. I feel ashamed of this, and I don't want to bother the people who care about anymore with this type of stuff. 

I hate having thoughts like this, and I'm not sure what to do."
582,Unfair,"Eventually the time will come by and we'll have to decide what to do with the rest of our lives. We have been blessed with no control, and only shame to gain if we ever decide to go back home. They say to go back inside of their and that life isn't fair, so while we're all gasping for a bit of air they sit back and watch as we despair."
583,What is even the point,"I know this is just going to come off as like senioritis or maybe some typical high school shit. But everything around me feels like it’s falling apart my friendships, family, school all feels like it’s crashing down. I have another “friend” that’s getting distanced front the former “group” . Another one of my friendships might end because I can’t cope with my own problems and it’s on the rocks now. My parents argue every night (that they’re both even home) about divorce and I’ve more than once heard my name in those arguments. College is coming up and I can’t even get into the one place everyone has expected me to go which isn’t even a top school. I can barely afford college and I can’t bear to put a burden on anyone else for any of my problems idk what to even do anymore."

585,Just Realized I’ve barely eaten this week,"I used to eat all the time, and just realized that I’ve only had one meal a day this week. Today, I only had a couple fast food chicken nuggets and now I’m lying in bed at 10:14pm, not tired but too unmotivated to get up and be myself. I’m slowly sinking away. Is a loss of appetite common?"

588,I keep having these recurring dreams.,"Apologies in advance for any mistakes, both in terms of grammar and spelling. It's 05:09 here and I've received little sleep in the past 48 hours.

I keep having these recurring dreams. One I have often is where I'm in water. It looks to be a beach. There's others on the shore, and they're watching as I'm quickly swept away by the tide. As I call out for help, water fills my mouth. Naturally I'm terrified of deep water, so this is a scary ordeal and I wake up in cold sweat. 

Another is where my teeth all fall out. Alternatively, there's these dreams where I get lost in empty spaces such as airports, only to be chased by faceless, demonic figures. 

Finally, I dreamt most recently of my old workplace in which I processed food. In my dream they're all standing there and watching as I struggle working on the conveyor belt. It gets faster and faster until eventually I can't keep up, and they're just standing there.

I wasn't sure if these are in relation to my depression. Most likely, but I thought I'd share nonetheless. 

I'm absolutely terrified."
589,My food tastes like grey,"I haven’t been depressed in a long time. Recently I had a bit of a really hard relapse into it for seemingly no reason.

Bit of a new thing is that I can’t taste anything. Never really had that happen before. Fruity things, ice cream, meat; they all taste like gray. 

It’s really affected me hard. I’m a big foodie and to have it taken away is just.. heartbreaking. I hope this ends soon."
590,I finally made a discord...does this up have a server or something?,I don’t know how discord works and I don’t even know if I’ll be able to use discord (anxiety talking to people I don’t know) but if there’s a discord for this sub or something idk then I’m interested

592,The Hole,"The only way to describe the physical feeling of depression. It’s not necessarily a sadness, or fear, or anger, it’s just a gaping big hole in the core of my being where happiness should be, or contentment, or peace. 

I lay here with all my worries and my anxiety and my exhaustion praying for the hole to be filled with goodness. Something to keep me from pondering why I am here."
593,"To my beautiful girlfriend,","
What I never told you is how depressed I am myself. I always made it seem less than it actually is. 

What I never told you is that I have had thoughts of suicide. I don’t want you to have to worry about me.

What I fail to show you is how much I care for you and how much I really do love you. 

To see how you are severely depressed kills me.

I feel like I’m failing you, like I could be the cause of your depression. 

I often wonder if our relationship is the reason you’re depressed. Like I might be the cause of your pain.

I just wanted to say I love you. You are the person that I want to live my life with. I pray and hope that you will overcome the pain.

If I had to I would die for you. I will always be a person to talk to. A shoulder to cry on. A hand to hold. And my arms will be held open ready to give warm hugs. 

That is, if I am still around"
594,I keep abusing drugs and i cant escape my ow. thoughts,"I keep abusing drugs to escape how i feel every single second of the day. I cant even wear a mask to hide it anymore. all my friends are tired of me being a downer just from whats left of my personality. and all i feel like doing is smoking pot and whatever else i can get my hands on. I’ve tried LSD, Molly, Adderall, DMT, and speed. A guy offered for us to do heroin and i said sure but now that i’ve agreed to that i don’t know what the fuck i’m doing anymore. My dopamine receptors dont fucking work. Getting high doesn’t even do anything for me anymore but i do it because its something to do. I dont know who i am anymore and all i want is to die so i can stop suffering. i keep having nightmares so i dont want to sleep. I’m always tired and unmotivated. i want fucking out right now please."
595,why?,"why did you do it? why did you break my heart like this? why did you willingly come into my life knowing you loved her? and when i asked if you did you said you didn't. why are you chasing after someone else who doesn't care about you when i'm right here? why do i have to love you so much im still going to stand here for you to fall back onto? every single time she breaks your heart im still there to help you. the worst part? i'm still fucking dating you. im still fucking dating you and watching you talk about her how you once talked about me. im watching her tear you apart and turn you into a cold hearted person.  you're so cold towards me. yet i still give you all i got because i love you more than i love myself. i'm still trying to pick up the pieces of the person you once were, the fun, loving, amazing person i fell in love with. im trying to put you back together in the hopes that just maybe, i can have you back. yet you cant see that. why do i have to love you so much? why cant you just forget her and love me like you used to?  


god this fucking sucks. i wish i just had someone to talk to but you were my best friend. the person i entrusted with everything and went to with everything. and now, i cant.

&amp;#x200B;

i wish i could just make this easy. i wish i could hate you and just leave and move on but i cant. i love you. i love you more than ive ever loved anyone before. i just want the person i fell in love with back. more than anything."
596,One of the only things keeping me upright is the fact that I want to have sex with as many women as I can this year. How's that for f*cked up?,"I'm 2 years divorced at this point.  Honestly my only goal in life is to fill out my sex bingo card.  I don't really know what that says about me, but otherwise I'm overweight with no friends.  Casual sex makes me feel like I'm achieving all of the social goals I need.  I know I'm in a severely bad place socially right now."
597,Hidden Happiness,"Hidden happiness

I was once asked why I had ever cheated. I paused. It’s as if Mother Earth had pulled down her blouse and let you nurse on pure joy, happiness, acceptance, the thoughts of being needed, the universe slowly pumping serotonin through your veins. 
Lust, that over bearing feeling of being wanted when you first lock eyes, as you slowly strip to your most comfortablest self, that feeling. 
That small high, when I’m at my lows. That small high, so addictive, yearns for me. Like a simple shower, in the lows you stay in long for the warm soft embrace. The calming. Soothing touch. But the highs it feels so much higher. Feeling the ripples down soft skin, flowing through hair, over goose bumps, your nipple, your navel, your thigh, like a rocky moss covered hillside, the vapor like a mist flowing over your own mountain. A waterfall of safety. 
Chasing the smallest of highs. This life dealt me with a c.g.u.i.r.f.s.t.e, allowing me to feel the lowest of lows. So the smallest highs felt even higher. The little things. Matter most to those in the lows. Like a small. hidden. happiness. 

Just needed to vent."
598,Physical Pain,"My depression, ocd, and anxiety really started about a year and a half ago and are getting worse and worse more and more rapidly. For the past couple of months, I’ve started to feel physical pain from these things. 

When I start to get anxious/worry, my eyes will start to burn, and my body will start to shut down and want to go sleep. I can even see the pain in my eyes if I look in the mirror.

My head hurts so bad. It’s not like a headache, it’s similar to the feeling you get in your head when your crying, even if I’m not crying. It just feels foggy and full of pain.

Recently, my legs have even started shaking/feeling weak for no reason, to the point where I need to sit down. When I get anxious/sad, I’ll also feel disorientated and feel like the world is spinning.

I’ve been breathing harder and my heartbeat is more heavy. I’ve found it harder and harder to do anything. Getting up in the morning has become 10x as hard. I don’t even want to sleep, I just want to lay in my bed and escape from my thoughts, but there is no escape. I can’t escape any of this and it’s just getting worse by the day. I feel like I’m also making all of this up to give myself an excuse to be lazy. I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I’m currently typing this while crying on my bed."
599,I fucking hate everything,Pretty much sums it up. Fuck everything. I give up.
600,Another therapist said I'm strange because I don't have a history of trauma or a family history of mental health/addiction problems.,"I have chronic depression, anxiety, and obsessions for no reason and my life is so thoroughly shanked it's basically a write-off. Wonderful."
601,Anyone else have family that worries about you comitting suicide?,"I was talking to my girlfriend about kids and she said ""just don't do anything stupid"". I thought she mesnt cheat. I asked what and she clarified that she was afraid if we had kids I'd kill myself.

Idk if anyone's experienced this but it's just... soul crushing"
602,considering cutting myself,"I can’t even look at blood or I pass out. But I don’t even care anymore. I’m really really close to starting. I just want to be distracted from all the mental stress, hurt, and pain. Maybe I’ll actually be able to cry if I cut myself.  I wish I could just cry away the pain. All I feel is the pressure behind my eyes but the tears won’t come out. 

This will probably get lost in the comments somewhere but I had to get it off my chest."
603,Everyday is worse,Can’t wait to kill myself holy shit
604,I only want to feel genuinely happy.,"I’m tired of overthinking. I’m tired of thinking of the trauma in the past. I’m better than all of the negativity, but it’s so hard..."
605,Life looking up,"I know this is mainly ab bad things going on in people's lives, however, I wanna share my recent success.
I am a 17 year old Male. I recently have been struggling with heavy depression and suicidal thoughts. However, yesterday I took the first step to getting better by reaching out to my local therapy center and set up an appointment next Friday. I also took time today off work to clean my car and make everything in my life feel better. And finally, after I got home, I took a shower for the first time in a few weeks and it just feels so much better than it has in a long time."
606,"The worst part of Depression: Even if things get better, You don't.","It feels like things have really started to turn around in my life. Something really really good just happened to me recently, and it was as a result of something I've been working hard for for a long time. I should be really happy, and for a while I was. And I tried, have been trying I guess, to take this positivity in my life and just run with it. To learn not to sweat the small stuff. Try to be positive instead of negative.

But the thing is that it's hard. It is so FUCKING HARD, because hating me is my safe space. It's how I fall asleep at night, it's how a rationalize difficult things I have to do, it's how I keep myself occupied when I'm bored. If anything bad happens, I blame me and how horrible I am, and how I've been a failure my whole life.. So even when I have no real reason to hate myself, I just want to. Because if I'm a failure, than my life, and my feelings make sense. 

It is a fight. Even when It seems like everything is going my way it's still a fight and that sucks. One of these days, I just want to wake up and like me, and like my life too. Guess I'm still here cause I still think there's a chance at that, but who knows, maybe I'm wrong."
607,*sigh*,"i wish i could go to therapy, i wish i had someone like that to just talk to. even if they’re being paid for it,  and even if they see a million people a day and could care less about me. sometimes you just need someone to listen, and someone to hear you. but i can’t. it’s expensive, you just get waitlisted for months and i couldn’t even bring myself to ask for help, or tell my parents who don’t even believe in depression that i want to see a therapist. saying i’m depressed is such an understatement, i feel like the word is overused anyways. i’m drained, i’m numb, i’m holding onto the dark thoughts that lie with me at night because they’re the only ones here and they’re all i have left."
608,Advice,"I have been depressed for years. I suffer in silence because I am already a burden to those I lie, especially my mother. I don’t know what to do, I feel like I don’t even have motivation for life. Everyday I just go through the motions until I can get in bed and say it was over. I barely have any joy in life, and when I do I feel I don’t even deserve to be happy, so I cut it off quick. I am a failure, why should I get to be happy all the time? What have I done to deserve happiness."
609,6 remedies for anxiety and symptoms of depression,"6 remedies for anxiety and symptoms of depression 

1- Choose how you see your life. For meditation to be effective it doesn't really matter how you view your life.But it can be useful to acknowledge the general theme, because that way you can be more alert to the tendency to slip into negative patterns of thought. And it's this increased awareness that provides the potential for sustainable change.

2- Communication relating to others. If you want to find a greater sense of happiness through the practice of meditation, taking out your frustrations on others is unlikely to encourage a calm and clear mind. Communicating skillfully and sensitively with other people is therefore essential on the road to getting some headspace.

3- Appreciation smelling roses.

4- Kindness toward both yourself and others. When you are kind to someone else it feels good for you and for them.

5- Compassion (in the shoes of others). Compassion is not something that we can do or create, it already exists in each and every one of us.

6- Balance. Life is not unlike the sea, ebbing and flowing throughout our lives. Sure, sometimes it's calm and serene, but at other times the waves can be so big that they threaten to overwhelm us. These fluctuations are an inevitable part of life. But when you forget this simple fact, it's easy to get swept away by strong waves of difficult emotions.

6- Acceptance. No matter how fortunate your circumstances, life can at times be both stressful and challenging. We often try to ignore this fact and therefore feel frustrated and disappointed when we don't get our own way."
610,How to explain gaps in resume from depressive episodes?,"I've taken gaps in my undergraduate degree and in my Msc degree due to mental health probems (still on going). But now i'm applying for jobs. How can I explain the gaps between my 2nd and 3rd year at Uni and gap during my Msc? Should I just lie and say family issues. Maybe that enough to get employers to drop the issue quickly? 

&amp;#x200B;

If i say personal issues, that could be deemed detrimental to the company, or interpreted as an employment risk... 

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've achieved a 2:1 in my undergraduate and Distinction at Msc level (in a science disipline)."
611,I feel like depression has taken away my personality,"It's hard to put my experience into words but I'm trying to in hopes of understanding it better. 

I feel like my entire personality has been gradually being swept away into nothingness. I used to have interests and hobbies and I could keep up a conversation, but I can't even do that anymore. Every response I give people now is auto-piloted, it's not really from me, or at least it doesn't feel like it is. The more I feel like I have no personality, the more I want to push away everyone and everything. Because soon enough they're all going to realize that I'm hollow inside, that I feel nothing, and that I have nothing to offer them. I'm just a blank slate that's incapable of becoming anything more than a depressed fuck who's too busy wallowing I'm self pity to even try to get out of it. 

If anyone bothered to read this and actually relates, give me a sign. I'd like to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Thanks."
612,Suicide is really just wanting to die sooner. I don’t see anything wrong with this. Can you change my mind?,"Yep. I said it. Suicide is just wanting to die sooner. And there’s nothing wrong with suicide in my opinion. Sure, someone in the world will mourn over your absence.. but there’s no bringing a lifeless mind, spirit and body back. People move on, that what humans do. But why? Why do we bear all of this pain ? Why must we live certain ways? Why do we need to go to college and have a career until we retire ? Why do we need anything really? We all die someday. It’s just a matter of time. People die everyday of every second from a car crash, a fire, heart attack, cancer, etc. And it’s never truly for just being old. Is it ? It’s all the complications that come with life, and age that slowly kill us. 

But if you’re truly feeling as if you’re unhappy with your life and don’t see any possible way of getting out... why is it looked down upon so much if you just want to die sooner? That concept never made sense to me. 

I have more to add.. but all I’d like to know is what life means to you and why? What’s the point if you know you’re going to die eventually? Change my mind."
613,I feel guilty about my existence,"i almost wasn’t born, my mother had to go through surgery and almost had her uterus removed. I was born from her hard work and the effort of doctors. It was a risky pregnancy and I was born premature. I never went to daycare because I spent my days in doctors appointments due to a dangerous kidney disease. I had to go through harsh treatments and eventually give them up. By kindergarten age I was “cured”.
I feel like my mother worked so hard just to have a useless, annoying and spoiled child like me, I’m not even normal, I’m an abomination. The doctors put so much time and effort for me to go about shitting on the world and then go kill myself. 
Whether I live or die, my parents will always resent me and I would’ve been a complete waste."
614,"Just cut, and it felt really good.","For the first time, it went away you know? The pressure. I was so focused on the knife work and the burning in my arm that it honestly made the world go null."
615,Never been more lonely in my life,"Everyone in my life keeps leaving  for no reason; they just like to pop in when it’s convenient for them and leave and I feel Ike this is starting to cause a fear of abandonment because I start to get really clingy bc I want them to stay in my life but they start to wave when I start showing symptoms or decide I’m “too mental” to hang out with. I really don’t want to go to my college the next semester but I don’t like living at home, it’s just all my friends from college haven’t txted me back or even txted me at all, like I thought we were good friends but I guess we were just friendly in a sense. Just sucks because I’m reliving everyday in a cycle, like I’m stuck in a shitty movie, and I don’t know how much longer I can take it."
616,No passion for anything,There's nothing in this world that I'm passionate about. No reason for me to want get out of bed and be happy. I honestly don't want to wake up. I don't think I'll ever have a passion. I just want to sleep forevee and not have to wake up to the dissapointment that my life is.
617,I don’t know,"I’m so fucking depressed. I feel like it’s a never ending cycle. I’m supposed to start applying for vet school next month but how do I sell myself to a school when I don’t even want to live?i feel just as depressed now as I was in high school only I’m so much more numb. I can’t dwell on it, I have too many responsibilities. I looked into it and I don’t think I’ll be baker acted bc I’m too fucking lazy to harm myself or commit suicide, and there’s no point in checking myself into a mental hospital. This is just so stupid to me. My mom is a psych nurse. She fucking knows I’m depressed. I feel like I have no one"
618,My parents are fighting over what to do with me. Why can't they see that I'm the healthiest I've been in years?,"Sorry if I'm all over the place, I feel like I just hit a wall.

I've been feeling like I'm finally coming around.  I quit smoking weed all day, every day (15 days! thanks /r/leaves!). I'm signed up for classes at a major university next semester and found my own place to live.  Hell, I even saw a psychologist and started taking medication again.  I may not have a job yet, but with so many major life changes going on, I figure that will come in time too.

But I just heard them fighting about what they're going to do about me.  My Mom can't decide if she wants to do everything for me, or if she wants to be mad that I'm not doing enough.  My Dad said ""Once he goes to college, I don't give a fuck what happens to him.""  I don't think he meant it to sound harsh and I don't doubt that he loves me, but hearing that I'm causing so much strain between them is bringing me down.  

I feel good, optimistic even, before all this. Yet all my parents see is a freeloading lazy sack of shit.  I don't see the point of getting a job for a month just to up and leave, plus I'd like to try enjoying the holidays instead of falling into a deep pit, like I have for every holiday for the past 14 years.  I want to feel proud of my decisions and accomplishments, but when the people who I look up to most don't see them, well they start to seem really insignificant.  Further, why do they think I'm so capable of so much more when for the past few years I've been a barely functioning stereotype.  

I feel normal, as normal as I've felt since I was a kid.  I am sure this feeling wont last, so why would I rush myself into an overworked, stressed state?  It seems so sensible to me, why can't they see it?!  

I have so many specifics that I want to talk about, but that's only making me angry to type."

621,faking a smile isn’t working,"Ive always been the type of person to hide my feelings to an extreme, and I always fake a smile. Laughing and hanging out with my friends makes it easier but it doesn’t make me feel any better on the inside. And then I keep feeling shitty because I think it made me feel better but I always feel worse. I’m getting worse each day and I just keep smiling but I need something to distract myself all the time or I fall into dark thoughts. I told all my friends I don’t like people checking in on me and since I keep faking happiness they don’t have a clue something is wrong. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I just wanna be somewhere alone and quiet but I can’t find somewhere a single place thats alone, where I don’t have to pretend."
622,My wife wants to move to move with our daughter to Germany with or without me,"  I am an American who met my wife in Germany 10 years ago. We have a 3-year-old daughter and they both have dual citizenship. We both suffer from depression. 

For the past several months my wife has not been interested in sex. She put on weight after having our daughter and has never been able to take it off. She also has a scar that she hates from the C-Section. She tells me the reason for not wanting to have sex is due to her discomfort with her own body.

My wife and daughter just got back from a 6-week trip to Germany to visit my in-laws. The trip was supposed to be a month, but the flight home had to get delayed due to my wife getting hospitalized for high blood pressure (My wife not only has high blood pressure but 5 years ago she was hospitalized due to kidney failure brought on by a rare blood disease called AHUS)

The day after my wife came home is when she told me she wants to move back home to Germany. She said she is homesick and wants to live near her family. Both of her grandmothers are very old and sick, and she wants to be there before they die. She says she wants me to go with them, but if I refuse, she will go anyway. She says she is miserable in the states and feels she has no life here. Due to her social phobias she has never really made friends of her own here. 

For me to stay in my family’s life I must move to Germany. I do not speak the language. I am a software developer and must find work there. I am unbelievably scared of risk of giving up our home, all our belongings, and starting over in a country i never lived in. That being said, my wife did the same for me when she moved to America, the only difference is that she knew English, and I do not know German. 

The stress of this decision is killing me. I have been in tears for 2 days now because I thought my wife was happy here. Once my daughter was born, we moved into a home that she picked out. I work very hard to give my family the best life possible, and now she wants to move back to Germany.

I am having a hard time believing she loves me due to the lack of sex and the fact that she would move back to Germany without me. She says she must do it because she is so depressed here without her family.

Any advice is appreciated. I really am a mess right now. 

We are meeting with a marriage counselor next week; I hope it can help our situation. I really do love her and could not imagine a life without her and my daughter in it."
623,Idk what to do... any advice?,"I’ve been depressed for about 6 years and was sooo good at hiding with my “mask” of being a bubbly athletic guy. But Now I’m failing out of college and I know that I have to change but I don’t know how I’m supposed to do it. I tried anti depressants and they sucked big time didn’t like it at all I got more moody. So now I’m looking at inspiring videos and they say you have to wake up early, say three positive things about yourself, make a check list of easier things to do to feel accomplished, eat 3 meals like a normal person, do something that makes you happy and go to bed at a reasonable time. I understand what the videos say but I have ZERO discipline in my life. I can’t do any of this stuff I can’t sleep and then I can’t wake up then I don’t eat and I don’t do school work I don’t do little positive self talk things. 

I’ve been depressed for so long it’s my lifestyle. Someone please help me. Any tips or any links to things that can help me structure my life so I can be normal or anything that’s not this. I know I’m smart but I can’t do school or life with the way I live now. Any questions please comment or message me! I’m at an all time low and seeking help from anywhere I can find it."
624,I feel like I’m going crazy,"My mental has been getting worse everyday I feel like the people who were supposed to be my friends have all been avoiding me 

Two days ago I ask one if they wanted to hangout and he was like I’m going over to other friends house I’ll ask if you can come then neither texts me for two hours I texted them both and the didn’t respond till eventually I get a “sorry my mom doesn’t want anymore people over”

I was kinda hurt by that bc I haven’t been out of the house in forever but whatever

Skip today today and they all post pictures on there ig all hanging out on the day I ask to chill w the bros

Idk it’s been going on for so long I feel so alone and just feel like I don’t care about shit now I just feel angry with everything like why am I being avoid what did I do wrong why tf me

I don’t feel ok"
625,Forcing myself to seem normal,"I tend to force myself into situations that I don’t like such as sitting at a bar with friends, and it never goes the way I hope. I always hope that I’ll be talkative and everyone will include me in conversations or smoke breaks even though I don’t smoke but I always end up on my own, on my phone to make it look like I’m busy. (Currently happening as I type this). I’m a wanna be extrovert with depression and it’s the hardest thing. I feel like it makes me more depressed when I end up sitting on my own around “friends”. I don’t know how to put myself out there any more than I already am but it doesn’t seem enough. Maybe one day I’ll realize I’ll never be included and I won’t have to force myself into these stupidly awkward situations."
626,"Remember, if you don't like your therapist you can and should fire them and get a new one.","I had about 6 sessions with 6 different therapists before sticking with the one I have been using for the last couple of years. If you don't feel at ease with your therapist, nothing says you have to keep using that person. I actually walked out mid-session once because I hated their approach. 

Your life is worth too much to just go through the motions. And if the therapist you don't like is any good at all they will want you to go to the person you believe can help you most. This is about your life; not their house payment. 

Stay strong my friends."
627,Alone before christmas,"I thought I was okay but im really not. I just need to rant.
My dad has cancer and the family has asked me to not come home until the 23rd so the chemo side effects have some time to wear off, and I miss home so desperately I haven't seen any of my family in 4 months bc what if i have any of them an infection that could be passed on. I'm so scared that will happen even when i come home so late.
This would be okay, except my roomate and boyfriend left to go home for the holidays today, so I'm 100% alone for a week. Which I thought would be fine but i cant sleep, I'm so scared and I can't stop crying. Humans are social fucking creatures and fuck i need support right now but i have no one to be with, everyone's gone to different corners of the country and are too busy to talk to me. I just want my boyfriend, or my mum or dad. Or just someone else to be in this house so I'm not too scared to sleep."
628,hi im sad :(,"i just finished my first (successful) semester at a 4 yr college. 4 classes. Think I got 2 Bs and 2 As. I thought I'd be happy. But I'm not in the slightest. im currently intermittently sobbing and laughing like a fkkING maniac HAHA. idk what will ever make me happy. this--the whole college thing, has been a huge struggle for me so I thought I'd at least feel something after \*finally\* doing well-ish. I think I feel even worse now than the previous two times I'd dropped out from a semester mid-way through. idk. i feel the absence of...something good(?) that I was expecting to be there."
629,Can I please talk to someone,I just want to kill myself. I cannot get rid of my problems and everyone else refuses to fix me. Killing myself apparently is the only way to get rid of my problems and take my pain away. Not therapy. Not medications. Not going to the hospital

631,It's Hitting Me Hard Today,"Today isn't a good day. I don't feel good about myself. I don't feel good about where I am in my life. I don't feel good about how I'm feeling. I feel so broken inside. Yesterday I was okay, today it hit me like a train that maybe I'm not okay. All my days are clouded together with shades of black and blue. Work. Make dinner. Clean. Shower. Sleep. Work. Make dinner. Clean. Shower. Sleep... 

I wish I didn't feel so depressed. I wish getting up in the morning wasn't so *hard.* I wish breathing wasn't such a struggle. 

It hurts today. My heart, it physically feels like it's being squeezed and my ability to breathe is withering as I sit here, the more time I have to *think.* The more time I have to think about just how *lonely* I am. 

Today, it feels like a ton of bricks is crushing my chest and no matter how many times I cry out for help, *nobody hears me.* Nobody can even *see* me. 

It's hitting me hard today... and I'm struggling, much like every day."
632,How I cope,"Hi everyone. I've been reading some of your posts here on the depression sub and it inspired me to share about my depression and how I cope. 

A little bit of backstory, I think I've had depression since I was about 12 years old and I always got made fun of for being overweight by my older brother. This instilled in me a deep sense of insecurity and anger from a young age. I would always stress eat which made my mental health even worse surrounding my self image. By the time I got to high school, I had severe anxiety about going to class and my grades were failing because of that. I ended up dropping out of high school and just being unemployed for a year or so before getting my high school diploma through a program in a local community college. I was and still am proud for not giving up on that. 
It was around this time I started taking SSRI meds to treat my depression, which I can't say has helped me and I didn't like having to rely on these pills to feel happy. I'm currently tapering off my antidepressants and am considering talking to my doc about bipolar disorder, because I have pretty intense mood swings and trouble controlling my anger.
I very easily let my anger get the best of me and it causes me to have these violent thoughts, which was only exacerbated by the medication I'm using. I have a few sad things which have happened like my girlfriend dumping me and my dad dying of stomach cancer 2 years ago. These only made my depression get a lot worse. One day, my mom brought home a bearded dragon named Lettie who always helps me through the hard times. 

She makes my life have meaning, I need to continue because I can't leave them behind. No matter how bad your depression gets, your life matters just as much as anyone else does and you shouldnt suffer alone. Im willing to talk if you just need to vent or share your troubles, please message me if so."
633,When to take Wellbutrin XR/Side effects,"Just prescribed Wellbutrin XR which has helped the depression and fatigue symptoms dramatically. I was told to take it in the morning, which I've done for the past week. But I'm getting an annoying effect where I get a huge wave of energy, and even agitation and anxiety every day around 4-5pm. I'm thinking maybe because it's XR, that's when most of it hits? Has anyone tried taking it at night so that it ""hits"" in the morning, or switching to SR and avoided this?"

635,"Everything is tasteless, my mind works against me and everything I achieved is emotionless.","I know I shouldn't think about killing myself and all but why should I continue like that ? I now the truth now, life sucks and everything in it isn't worth my time, because nothing matters. This world/univers is so fucking cruel and sounds like the most machiavellian scenario ever ! I truly think some cursed me at this point or that am tortured in some kind of simulation. Why do we have this capacity to destroy our self by thinking, but not controlling it ! Does that mean we're not owner of our thoughts ? What are we ? Why does it have to be this complicated and how does that mean anything ! Am pretty sure I've reached the crazy side of my mind, I lost the path back to sanity but I know something is wrong at least. Do you believe in god ? If you do what's the point ? If you don't what's the point ? We fucking have nothing to work with and no one gives a shit !
I want to be free of all of this ! Why do I feel inexistant ? Am I dreaming ? Will I wake up just before I die ? We always wake up before we die in dreams, but does that mean we never died there ? If you read all that, thank you."
637,Kicked out of university,"After a year of shit grades because I have depression and anxiety, I was put on academic probation, meaning I'd have to get a 2.0 or I'd be dismissed.

Was doing good in all my classes until I missed my final. I set my alarm and I guess it didn't go off. Boom! Failed that class with a D, which I took the year before at another school, so now I'm on my third go!

ONE fucking day I miss, one easy final and boom, I'm done. I can't come back next semester.

I can't describe adequately in words how suicidal I'm feeling currently. I have nowhere to go. Now I just get to work a shit job while I sit in my dad's basement and beg my school to let me back.

I turned 20 five months ago. I was supposed to be a Junior after I finished this semester. Now I'm expelled.

I seriously just want to fucking die so bad. I hate myself. One. Day. One day ruined everything. Fuck."
638,I dont know what to do,I’m 18 about to turn 19 no friends living with my older brother it’s not the worst life but not the best I’m a high school drop out due to my area and me always having an excuse for everything the beginning of the year started okay got my first job fired got rehires somewhere new life seemed to be okay till I got fired last time since then I’ve been in my room getting money from my dad using it to survive which I’m not proud of no one says anything about me being in my room I feel dumb filling out apps and looking online all I ever wanna do is beat my head in cause I’m so stupid I just gave myself a mild concussion beating my head like an idiot but I know nothing else I ask for guidance and get directed into a poll I just wanna sleep but now I’m screwed due to the concussion as said I really don’t know what to do but break down I know almost nothing and the one I look up to can’t even help me yet he’s bout to go on a trip soon...
639,slowly drowning,my parked car was totaled on my birthday by an uninsured drunk driver. it was my main source of income so i haven’t been able to afford another one. it’s caused me to start missing work which means i get paid less. i have to pay for transportation too. they’re about to fire me for missing work and being late. which is out of my character. i’ve always really punctual. my savings have dwindled to nothing. this might be the last month i can afford rent and electricity. so now i’m getting close to being homeless. i’m starting panicking. i think i’d rather be dead than homeless so suicide keep popping into my head. i feel cursed.
640,She just broke up with me,"I'm new here and I have been trying to talk to my friends about it but they are to busy with their own lives and my parents help but it's not enough. Ok so I've been with the most amazing,sweet,caring, girl since my freshman year of high school she made everything the greatest, she helped me through some very low points in my life we basically helped make each other who we are today,our relationship was one of the best things to happen to me. We took care of each other but, after the first yeah I noticed that her parents were very ""traditional""( I use that term loosely) they would not let us spend time like the other couples,it was off putting at first but I tried to understand it. Fast forward 3 years she's in college her parents still treat her like a 15 year old and,I'm struggling to find a job,we have to sneak out at night to see each other at night when she comes back on the weekends. But as her finals approached she became more stressed it seemed and her parents wouldn't let us be together but it's been 2 weeks since we snuck out and seen each other. Fast forward to about a week ago when I got a message saying ""we should take a break, all I do is hurt u because  we cant spend time together and I need to focus on my exams"" (I abbreviated) so I'm of course devastated and refused to accept  it and we talk, I say ""that's not how relationships work u dont take breaks"". She decided just to break up and leave me. That was a about a week and a half ago I've been crying myself to sleep every night and pretending to be ok for my parents. I have been contemplating whether or not I should take my life. All I think about is her everywhere I go, she doesn't leave my mind."
641,Another version of myself,"Does anyone else have this image of who they want to be but it seems so unreachable? I have a realistic happier version of myself in my head and I know exactly how to get there except I’m not doing anything about it. My brain just starts dwelling on everything that could be, why cant I just go ahead and be who I want to be??"
642,I fucked up the only place where I’ve ever really felt happy.,My old job was the only place where people saw me as put together and professional and dependable. I was the person where if I called off the entire shift was completely fucked and whenever I showed up everyone would be like oh thank god you’re here you’re gonna make everything run so smoothly. I left for college and even though I’m going back at the end of next semester I feel like it’s never going to be the same again and that makes me so sad. It felt so good to have somewhere where I wasn’t just that pathetic sad kid and where I was a leader and it makes me feel so hopeless knowing it’s not going to be the same when I go back.
643,"Okay, so this kind of doesnt relate to me, but does...","A few days ago, my friend attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on Tylenol pills and cutting her wrists. She sent us all a haunting ”goodbye message” at 4:50 am that day. She hadn't come to school for a while, later through a friend I learned she was in the hospital, and she is at this moment. I'm just kind of... Surprised, and I don't know what to feel. I'm pretty uhm... Mental is the only word I can find, so I've always thought about the idea of death and y’know stuff like that. But I never really thought about the fact that one of my friends could do this. I just don't know what to do. I think that some of the factors leading to it were her vision of her body/ weight, and maybe my fault. I really feel guilty because I've been a really shitty friend to her, so I wondered if maybe I was a factor leading towards that. I know this is kind of a rant, and maybe i’m just over thinking everything, or i’m weak, but it feels nice to write somewhere about this."
644,"Without the benzos, I'd be fu@#ed",".5mg 5x a day and ive been doing that for 3 months. Wasn't until I decided to wean myself off them by taking them when I felt it necessary, that things started going sideways again. 

Im not into the idea of taking them forever, but they're the only thing keeping my mood level. As soon as I start messing with them, I find myself totally anxious and it feels like I'm moving in fast forward. 

I now understand why I've spent most of my life smoking micro-doses of pot all day long. It has nearly the same effect as benzos, in that it keeps me calm. When I'm taking benzos, I've no need to smoke pot."
645,Do cbt work books not work for anyone else?,they just don't do it for me tbh
646,I'm losing my will to fight,"It all just seems like a waste of time and effort.

The next day everything is back to being shit doesn't matter how hard I try.

My sleep schedule is fucked up, which fucks my studies, which makes me wanna do drugs/just watch series and do nothing, I'm not cleaning I'm not eating well I'm losing my friends I feel lonely.

I wanted to post on r/gettkn"
647,Trying so hard and still horribly depressed,"Before with my depression people would say 'well you need to take your medication, you need to go to therapy'

For once in my life I'm finally follo
wing through on all of those things and still... I feel as bad as ever. All these things have taught me is an awareness of my problems but i still feel completely unable to fix them.

It's actually made me feel more depressed than ever. When you're doing everything you can and it's still not enough, why even carry on?"
648,My life is falling apart,"I thought things were heading the right direction. I was feeling more optimistic and steady about my future. But once again something struck again. I am starting to give up on myself, leaning towards suicidal thoughts. Each failure I try to endure just cuts deeper and deeper and reminds me how NOT good enough I am. I just want to be happy. I had such great aspirations and I was saving up to buy a wedding ring for my partner... but once again life just happens. I am constantly struggling financially and can never get a break. I need positivity more than ever. I am at a breaking point and at a dead road where I am starting to lose hope and possibly consider not being here anymore...."
649,"I sometimes genuinely smile and laugh, but I still feel nothing during these moments","There are moments where I know I am happy, but I don’t feel it. No matter how happy I am that numb, empty feeling won’t go away. It could be the happiest moment of my entire life and I would maybe feel a little spark of joy, if I was lucky."
650,"Help, I have no interests","I’m 19. I have no interests. I can’t pay attention to anything. I can’t fall in love for more than a few seconds and then I get distracted. I just surf the internet all day. I can’t even have fun with friends anymore, I’m so distracted and depressed. I have no friends, I’ve pushed them all away. I haven’t hung out with friends in 2-3 years. I can’t read books, or watch movies or TV shows, or play games. All I do is surf the internet and watch the first 1-3 minutes of a youtube video then switch to another one, or maybe I’ll have a thought and google it. 

I am diagnosed with ADHD, and I’ve tried three different stimulant medications, all make me really depressed and anxious and irritable. I’m in college, but I’m going to start failing soon, I know it. I’m fucked."
651,Here we are again,"First post, didnt think I'd ever do this to be honest. As I sit here, drinking my beer, fresh out of the hospital I realize how much of a failure I am. I had this girl ya see, she was the most angelic figure I'd ever seen. She had everything going for her yet she couldn't see that herself. Things were really good and hopeful for a while, but I fear we moved to quickly before getting to know one another. Now I feel she hates me and will never speak to me again. I dont want to rush into trying to get her back because I was an asshole and people need space, I get that but I didnt listen to her and just put my problems on her. She listened, she loved. What did I do to help did I even help or was I just a burden? Basically why I'm writing this is because I'm in an extreme amount of pain losing this wonder of my life, who genuinely listened and cared. Why do I push the people that deeply care about me, away? What the fuck is wrong with me?"
652,I can't stop my anxious habits and I'm starting to get really scared,"I know this is a depression subreddit but this is because of my depression and the anxiety caused by it. I can't stop hurting myself, not like cutting but ripping my hair out, biting my nails and biting skin off my lips. No one notices the hair, because I have a shit ton of hair, but now I'm starting to notice all the baby hairs.. my lips always burn... it hurts when I stub my raw nails on things. I'm hurting myself so badly and I don't even mean to. I just want to feel better."
653,Analysis Paralysis,"A journal entry....

I used to write these entires for myself, now its exclusively so I have something to share with my therapist. Lately I seek therapy to reassure my decisions. I wish for sessions to give me clarity...sometimes they do. I spend great portions of my days envisioning the future. I've envisioned a future for the girl that now holds my heart. I've envisioned both the worst of times and the best of times; I've directed great arguments as well as lavish celebrations. I've only went out with her twice and yet a slew of possible fates have been considered. 

Countless possibilities are scattered around me, in full-bloom, but, as history will tell it, once I've finally decided on a particular direction, it'll appear to have become withered. In time, the options I've kept in my back pocket, the plan B's and C's, will have lost the initial appeal they once possessed. And so I remain stuck, contemplating, dreaming.

I envy those who endure without giving rein to the possibility of defeat. ""Oh, but most of them must have a safety net,"" I tell myself, even though I damn well know that there are countless others who've bloomed in rooms way dimmer than mine, some seemingly pitch black. And since I'm stuck between securing a stress-free financial situation in my parents' near future while also seeking the best way to invest in MY own future, I avoid accruing debt like the plague, clinging to individual dollars knowing damn well that they alone will never lift me out of this muck."
654,I want to be hugged but I can't,"Sometimes I get a sudden feeling of loneliness. I don't really have anyone to turn to for emotional help since I spend all my time in my room playing videogames. Sometimes I try my hardest to belief that the pillow I'm hugging is a real person, returning the hug but it doesn't help. I have no social life and it's hard for me to just ask someone for a hug even a family member. At this point, I wouldn't even care if I knew the person, I just want someone to hug me back. But my loneliness has led me to avoid people which means I will never get a hug because I will never ask for one and I feel like I'll be lonely forever. I hoped writing this post would somehow help but it hasn't. I guess I'll post it anyways incase someone feels like reading it so it atleast does something useful."
655,Does anyone else get like this?,I swear each time someone yells at me I feel like its all my fault where I should’ve just killed myself and I wouldn’t have caused any problems in that persons world because I have that all the time and it makes me annoyed at myself because I can’t stop thinking about and I just ended crying the whole day and in a pissed off mood and just staring at a wall or something
656,I feel so weak for being depressed,"Why can’t I just pick myself up and not keep getting knocked down?? I feel weak for not being able to escape these feelings of constant sadness and pain. I feel like I used to be more active, and now I feel like I’m just watching a movie about my life going downhill and I can’t stop it. It’s getting harder by the day to just get up. I feel like I’m only at peace when I’m sleeping, but most of the times I have nightmares related to my ocd/anxiety. I can’t escape and I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s like a box that I can’t get out of"
657,Looking for a way out of his black hole,"I’ve been severely depressed the last 2 months basically.  I work as nurse in urgent care 3 days a week doing 12-13 hour shifts. On my 4 days off I wake up, take my daughter to school, come back home and sleep even though I’ve already slept 7-8 hours the night before, then wake up when it’s time to pick her up, bring her home, sit on the couch, make dinner, watch a movie, sleep and repeat. I had surgery last week so I have this week off to recover and so far I haven’t left my couch. I’m miserable, I cannot find joy in anything. My daughter and I just moved here almost 2 years ago and I don’t know anyone outside of coworkers. Being a single mom makes it hard to get out though as I prefer to spend my nights and days off with her. What are some things I can do to fill my time? I’m trying to think of hobbies I can afford on a budget, bc i barely break even at the end of the month as it is. I can’t do any strenuous exercise for 2 months due to my surgery. Any tips will help."
658,i feel like my therapist is the only person who cares about me,"I seriously love my therapist she is so kind and amazing. I feel like she is the only person who cares about me and wants me to get better. No one in my family or friends cares. No one has ever seen my signs of depression and has helped. I never truly received love in my life, I hated being home and hated being at school. I have a history of being rejected or made fun of in school and now being 21 I have this huge fear of getting close to people and Its hard for me to form close relationships with others. And when I have, like recently (past year or so) those people do be dirty, use me, hurt me and are just horrible to me. I don't me to be a ""why me"" bitch but at times I often think why me. I try to be a nice person and I truly care about others while they never seem to care about me. In friendships or relationships I'm always the one who cares about the other person more than they care about me. I just feel so lost. I'm about to graduate college and I'm not ready, Im still so depressed and don't know what to do. I had recently seen my therapist yesterday and I won't be seeing her until when next semester starts since she is a therapist at my college. and I sadly only have 8 sessions in total with her, and my next one will be the 6th. I'm going to ask her if maybe she can still be my terhapist cause maybe she can accept my insurance? I will see. But I feel like she truly listens to me and understands my pain. I had a therapist before but I feel like she never helped me see the deep rooted issue causing my depression and now I know cause of my new therapist. She has helped me realize that my depression from my preteen and teen years was never healed or never had an opportunity to heal so I continued to be depressed into my college years. I am so mad cause yesterday I was so happy. I felt like I had a chance to be happy. But idk today I feel so hopeless. But I atleast look forward to talking to her next year, I will try to stay positive this winter break. I am starting work soon and I want to have a great winter break and enjoy my break by being productive, watching tv shows I want to watch, paint, read, do fun things and etc. I am so nervous for my future since how can I know what career field I want to go into when I'm so depressed. I wish I got help earlier, like when I was a teen but I can't do anything about that now. I feel like my life is slipping away, I wish my brain would stop eating me alive. I want to live, yet I am so tired. I think I'm going to start making myself happy with making myself feel good through wearing clothes I like, makeup I like, having a clean room and setting a schedule for myself to be productive. I want to live, and I am happy to know I think that my therapist thinks I deserve to be happy and that my pain and what I am feeling is valid. For so many years I told myself that I wasn't depressed since I hadn't gone through anything extremely traumatizing but she is right what I've gone through is painful and not being loved or feeling wanted throughout my whole life is something that would cause anyone to feel badly or sadly about. I hope to make her proud."
659,Someone to talk to,"Just feel like i cant talk to anyone. I  feel like im always there for everyone but when im struggling, no ones there for me."
660,My parents have caused so much mental suffering for me in the past and now I'm in a sharp decline. The problem is I still have no right to be a failure because so many people have it worse but still succeed.,"I'm in my mid-20s and don't live at home but the bullshit they get up to still affects me mentally (and they somehow managed to drain a good chunk of my bank account before I caught it). And my little brother still at home has to deal with the brunt of it and that fucks with my head too.

However, they had a much worse childhood than me so if I complain about it they just deflect with that and I have no way to counter. And failure is always inexcusable, so many people deal with worse so I have no right to let it phase me but it has. Maybe I should just pay the ultimate price for being a failure already and get it over with."
661,New depression meds making me extremely tired,"So a little backstory

Im 15 and a couple weeks ago my mom made me go to the hospital to get a phyc eval after she found me smoking weed twice in one week due to my suicidal thoughts. The hospital after talking with me sent me to a mental institution where i stayed for 9 days. They put me on 50 Zoloft. 

And in the institution the made us go to bed at 9 so that's why i figured i was tired earlier at first. And now its to the point where during school im falling asleep all while barley being able to stay awake at home long enough to eat dinner. Which is like 3 hours after i get home ( for context ). And idk why tho.

It could be the meds or just the depression itself but idk which one. Bc i still feel depression to a good degree but its just different now. Its really hard to explain how it makes me feel. So idk if i would need an increase or what in my meds. 

Because if my meds are already making me this tired then what would an increase do?"
662,Ahhh damn it,"Just threw up my dinner but its okay, I cant give up, I have to keep going"
664,No one will listen to me,I can't open up to my family without them telling me how awful their day was and how people in Africa have it harder than me. You have nothing to be sad about. My dad said you only open to you therapist why not us?
665,Some people describe depression as sadness.,"Let me be the first to say I envy you. I’ve been sad before to the point where I referred to myself as depressed. Constantly moving around feeling sorry for myself and anger towards others. Feeling like it would never go away. Having pure raw emotion towards life in general. I envy that. When I had that, life still had meaning. Even though I was upset, I knew there was something that caused me to be upset. Something that if it change in my life I would be able to move past that mindset. That is no longer the case. There’s a numbness to everything. Whether something is good or bad, I have to force emotion out of myself to have any sort of reaction to it. It’s a constant lack of care in every aspect of life. A feeling of nothing towards everything. It’s a feeling that truly can’t be understood except by people that go through it. I never understood it truly until I realized I was in it. I don’t know where I exactly am going with this, but just thought I’d let some thoughts out."
666,incredibly low self esteem,A Girl can fall in love with me at the first glance and I would still push her away by saying that she deserves better. I am just pathetic.
667,i have remorse,"you know i am used to keeping everything to myself, i grew up knowing that i am alone, i fight problems alone, i carry my misery alone feel me? And then it just happened that I talked about all those things in front of my whole family. I released my anger against them, the pain the sorrow and everything, after that I felt better but then I regret everything. I regret that I told them that I would have killed myself and that I should be dead by now. I just feel like I'm too dramatic and yeah I regret that time I feel like shit. Help."
668,What do you do when you're not sure how to live anymore?,"I haven't been on here in awhile. I got some new meds, ones that allowed me to keep a more even keel. But even then, I've had this gnawing feeling that things with me still aren't right. 

Nothing in life makes me feel happiness anymore. I smile, and my body reacts to the emotions it's supposed to be feeling, but I don't actually feel anything myself. I don't remember what it's like to feel normal anymore. I'm not sure if it's the meds, or if it's just how screwed up I am emotionally and mentally, but it sucks. It's an odd feeling of wanting to be everywhere all at once and not having the energy to do anything, to feel anything. I'm not sure what to do about it anymore. I just wish I could go back to feeling things without having to deal with the onslaught of negativity my mind will inevitably throw at me. 

What do you all do when you feel this way? What helps you reconnect with the world around you? I'm beginning to wonder if life is even worth living if you're just going through the motions."
669,Emotionally abusive girlfriend does not leave me,"I am exhausted. It’s been years and she refuses to leave me.

She abuses me emotionally.  She belittles and insults me constantly.  

I have asked her to move out several times.  I have blocked her several times.

I am thinking of calling the cops or lawyer or getting a restraining order.  

No way to live.  She is killing the last bit of me alive inside of me."
670,I am shameful and inferior,"Most of my lived experience is being reminded of my failures and embarrassments and feeling ashamed of myself. My life is passing me by and I can't manage to do anything.

I hate hearing about other people's lives. I can't escape it. I cannot erase the memories or stop the thoughts. All I can do is kill more time by distracting myself. Existence hurts, remembering who I am makes me sick with anxiety, and talking to people only makes me more ashamed.

I am inferior to others and I am painfully aware of it. I will never experience what they experience. Life has been spoiled for me. I feel that I don't deserve anything. I wish I were never born"
671,"Never thought about the real world, and it's almost here","Ever since I was 13 I said that I would kill myself by my 18th birthday. I never planned out my life past that point. Never looked into jobs, school, nothing. Now that my 18th is around the corner and I'll be done with high school I've decided that is'nt the path I want to take I have no idea what to do. I really don't even know what I like enough to make a career out of. Any help or things I should look into would be greatly appreciated."
672,It's so discouraging,"Every day it is more and more of a struggle to actually do things. I have alarms set for everything because if I didn't I would just stay in bed all day and never go to work, never pay bills, just never do anything. It takes so much effort to smile and be social and pretend that I don't feel hollow and ripped open every day.

A few days ago after talking to a friend I decided that maybe I should try seeing someone. Reached out to multiple counselors/therapists inquiring about taking on new patients, and no one has returned a call. I even sent out emails. For the first time since I managed to stop drinking I actually made an effort to get better, and it feels like the universe is spitting me in the face saying ""not this time.""

I want to get better. I want to slim down, have a social life, not be scared of opening up to people. And yet every day I can feel my resolve wavering and soon I think I will be stuck like this forever."
673,Why am I here?,"Ah man, where to start? I really fucking hate my life like forreal. Every milisecond of my life is either spent in pain, sorrow, or a combination of both(when the universe is feeling spicy and really wants to fuck me over). I genuienly feel like the world is against me. Right now im even questioning if i should post this cus im not 100% sure the people who are reading this are real. I feel like everyone is fake and are put against me. Like im the big joke and its fun to torture me. (Like that one movie The Truman Show) But yea, maybe not. Maybe Im just crazy, I mean how could i be that special that everyone would be put against me right? Im a fuckin loser. But yea this shit sucks man and every time something decent happens to me its like it goes right back to shit again. For every 1 good thing that happens to me its like theres a 1000 more bad things just waiting to happen. Its like god or whatever gives me this one good thing every once in a while so I can have hope and think “hmm maybe life wont be so bad” just so I can get enough motivation to not kill myself and he can continue torturing me. AND I FALL FOR IT EVERY TIME. Oh well, for now im just running out the clock. Just sitting here waiting to die."
674,I'm fucked. It's all falling apart,"Haven't been into work for two days... I was falling asleep at the wheel on Friday and haven't been outside since then. I have no confidence left at all. I just can't deal with it. My mind hasn't gone yet but I'm in limbo. I'm hiding in my room like a child but I'm supposed to be a 34 year old man. I couldn't keep up with my flat anymore and I moved out of there a couple of months ago. It's just been slowly falling apart for the last six months and I just want it to be all over. Sometimes people get up and make a final stand and go out in glory but I am just curled up in a ball not doing anything.

I can't do my job anymore and I can't find another one. I can't even go to the doctors and get signed off. I'll get sacked soon and then I can live off my savings for a couple of months and then I'm back to being destitute. I can't do it again. I have nothing in life I want to do I just want to die in my sleep. I'm too much of a coward and lack the energy to kill myself. The only person my death will effect is my mum but she can't handle me as I am now anyway. She is the only person I speak to and thinks I just need to do this or do that and i will 'rebuild my life' but I can't and I dont want to anyway. I'm sick of it. It's not worth it. I wish I had a gun so i could go outside and shoot myself. The only real option I have is to find a height and jump and I'm too much of a coward. 

The only regret I have in life is that when I tried to stab myself to death several years ago I survived. What a sick joke."
675,Social media is deceiving and here's proof,"I'm depressed,  my insurance is gone, I'm applying for low level jobs and selling crap to buy Christmas presents. In short my life sucks. 

My mom and I went to a sports bar for lunch today,  my friend was there, we took a selfie with a group.  So on paper I look like a social butterfly. I'm not. 

I come home to the same emptiness."
676,Does anyone else feel like they have never truly felt complex emotions?," Everyone talks about love, hatred, joy and sadness. I honestly feel like the only emotions I have felt in my lifetime have been small, momentary points of disappointment or a small gratifying second. I can't say that I have any regrets, even though I've definitely done things I shouldn't have. I have never been romantically involved with anyone, or even particularly attached to my friends or family. I just feel like I'm going through life without meaning or purpose, doing the same motions as everybody else but not getting the same fulfillment. I don't even know if this is depression or something else, because I don't feel the stereotypical ""sadness"" that comes with depression, just nothingness."
677,Accommodations for my Depression,I have major depressive disorder and panic disorder that significantly impact my day to day life. I was wondering if I should bring it up to my Doctor and therapist so I can have accommodations to help me deal with school and work.
678,Antidepressant day 3,"I’m trying. I got back on meds 3 days ago and am seeing my therapist routinely.

I’m trying. 

I brushed my teeth and changed my clothes. I swear I’m trying. 

Went to work and participated in a meeting and helped where needed. I’m trying. 

All that’s going through my mind is that I’m a fucking failure. Every step taken is a step with me trying but it doesn’t feel that way. It feels like everything I do is a failure. How do I get out? How do I get better? Do I ever get better?"
679,I fucked up at school,"Yeah so, this year i was diagnosed with depression, I kind of knew it for a while now but hearing from a doctor really hits hard, thing were pretty shitty for a while, I had just moved to a new school and I didn't really know anyone there, I ended up skipping a whole semester and not doing any of the exams, now it's December (i'm Brazilian and here the school year ends in December) and i don't have the energy to recover from all the tests and assignments I missed, getting up of the bed is really difficult most of the time, so studying enough to recover 10 classes is impossible, I'm going to have to do this year all over again and that feels so bad."
680,Day who even knows of me waiting till the last minute to study for finals 😓😔,"Yet I'm probably not even gonna start until much after this post

Why do I do this to myself?"
681,I have the flu. Doesn’t help with depression,There’s not much more to it. I want to kill myself. I won’t cuz I promised not to. And I’m miserably sick.
682,Fucking tired.,"You know Fuck Depression, am sick and tired of beating myself up over something that people do/did to me. Fuck all girls who played me, Fuck all girls who rejected me, fuck the goals I couldn't achieve,fuck the failures I encountered and Fuck having a low self esteem.

Just Fuck Everything"
683,is it a revelation or am I just completely unstable?,"I've recently come to the realization that I'm totally fine with the idea of being alone (today in fact), however, I'm pretty sure I have undiagnosed borderline personality disorder as I tend to feel emotions in quick succession, usually over the span of days at a time even though I usually don't show any outward signs (it can be hours if I have people to talk it through with), and while I'm fine with the idea of it right this second I have no idea how I'll feel tomorrow or the next day or the next"
684,Cmon just breathe in through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth,"Cmon girl, you can wait, make that effort for him. You have to make it up. I know its painful but you can do it. Keep breathing."
685,Just breathe... relax...,"I feel like im falling down an endless black hole and im trapped in it, there's no way I can go back up."
686,The way I were raised and how it affects me till this day.,"In my family we didn’t discuss feelings, we didn’t discuss the way we felt about anything. I’ve always cried alone, I learnt to cry alone ever since childhood. I comforted myself, I never expected anyone to be there for me. You don’t talk about personal problems because then you’ll become a burden. And so I can’t talk about personal problems, I can’t. It’s so uncomfortable talking to my social worker because everything I tell her is a lie, I feel bad, but I just don’t have the ability to tell her how I really feel, not even mother, not even my closest friends. Im really good at pretending, you would never know what really dark things go on in my head, my own mother can’t even tell. There’s no way to help me."
687,I just realized I am alive,"For the past year or so I have been struggling. For some reason I had this delusion that I was actually dead. I never actually believed this- but whenever something would happen in my life I would always say to myself ""oh yeah well I am dead so it doesn'g matter."" So subconsciously I did actually think I was dead- and so I basically had no motivation to ever do anything but simple things like gaming or watching TV for an entire year basically- I would drink alcohol to relax too sometimes. Today I realized that I am actually still alive by putting an end to that voice in the back of my head. Right now I know I can do anything I want in the world. This level of optimism will probably go away tomorrow- but I finally got over the demon in my head so I feel much better about life in general."
688,I hate my life I just wanna hurry up and die,But I wont kill myself because my family thinks that's cowardly and I ain't no coward btw i dont think its cowardly
689,The only time I will ever thank Facebook,"Today marks the third year since my mother passed away. Her Facebook account is still active and having the ability to open up messenger and just say everything I never did helps so much.

It is both a weight off my shoulders but also a reminder of how shitty I was towards my mom in the later part of her life and further adds to the depression knowing I will never be able to change that."
690,I deactivated my facebook.,"I wanted to write out a status letting people know where I've gone. Y'know typical shitposter always making an ass out of myself. I just couldn't do it.  They don't care, I've neglected the ones who care without condition, but have been vying for the respect for people who don't care. Maybe it's because my entire life my ""friends"" were DNA relatives to me and I wanted that so bad to happen again. I've moved 500+ miles away though.  


I don't know, I'm fucking hurting and it's self inflicted. There's SO much I've been masking since 2011 that I dread being myself, but I don't even know who that is so how can I dislike being something that I don't even know of?  


Shit has hit the fan but I threw the shit, and stood right in front of the fan. I've turned into the one person I resent most in my life, and am nothing like the ones I respect most."
691,Literally fuck everything,"Honestly I might as well die, what the fuck am I even living for, people only complain about me, I get I have some OCD Anxiety and depression symptoms but they want me to talk it out and then they complain. Like tf. All my friends are gone, my boyfriend might leave, my closest family member(cousin) hates me and blocked my number, and my parents are overprotective as it is, I tell them anything, this place turns into a prison. I just wish someone wouldn’t be overbearing or complain, I just wish someone would listen and maybe offer advice."
692,In struggling to accept theres anything wrong with me.,"I was in a really bad place the last couple years, and I can feel myself wanting to go back there since it's so much easier. Everytime I do something or feel something and I think ""maybe this isn't normal, maybe I can get help"" I always end up thinking I'm just selfish and self centered and want all the attention by saying I have anxiety, depression, etc and just talk down to myself till to feel like shit and disregard what I did. I'm so scared what I'm feeling is me just wanting attention and being stupid and diminishing people who actually have it. I dont know what to do. I  have been losing my appetite and feeling like garbage and I only feel better when I'm around my friends at school but I dont want to go to school and I feel like shit everytime I miss. I just felt like ranting and I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit but I never seem to do anything right anyways."
693,Hair loss on Wellbutrin &amp; Prozac,"Hey guys

I'm currently on 150mg of Wellbutrin and 75mg of Prozac.  I was previously on 250mg of Effexor only.  I then got onto the Wellbutrin in early summer and started the dose of Prozac a couple of months ago.  I was weaned off of the Effexor and no longer take it.  I've only been taking this combo for a few months, but all of a sudden noticed that my hair is MOST DEFINITELY thinning out -- it's crazy how much hair I'm losing!   What was once a THICK mane of hair has now become so thin and flat :( . It's also gotten SO dry and brittle :( 

 Has anybody had the same issue?  I've read somewhere that this type of hair shedding is called Telogen Effluvium, but curious if anybody has ever had this happen for the first few months of taking this medication and then having the TE go away in time?   I've reached out to my doc but he says this isn't a common side-effect from my medication.  I've also recently had a physical with my primary care doc and nothing was out of the ordinary.  Is it just something that happens for a few months and then my hair will grow back? 

Any ideas or similar experiences?  I can't tell which medication is causing this either!"
694,Why is life so hard?,"I’m tired. I don’t wanna be sad, I don’t wanna snap at my mom in anger. I hate telling myself I’m shit every day. 

I had dreams, ya know? But now I can’t even see myself waking up tomorrow. Why do our parents bring us into the world and treat us like shit? Why do they force us tortured souls to live when we’re numb inside?

Why is my mind so sick? Why does life keep screwing me over when I did nothing. I was just an innocent child and I had everything taken from me...

I just want to sleep, and I’m so tired. I don’t care anymore. School, friends, family, nothing.

They took everything from me. My house, my dad, my friends, my cat. My dreams. Yesterday I saw myself going to college and fulfilling my dreams, but tomorrow is just a thick fog.

If we’re all made of stardust, then I wanna go back home....."
695,How to work on self care?,"I mean the hard self care. Cleaning your house, showering, eating. I just can't make myself do it. I don't know how anyone can."
696,Woke up upset that I wasn't back in the unit,"My cat, Ruffles, has severe allergies to like the universe. Her medicine is $145 for three month supply.
I'm part time since I came back to work since being in the unit. So four days a week.
Plus, the holidays. Granted, I get Christmas day and the day after off but it's going to be a long week (Friday through Tuesday).
I'm just.... I'm tired."
697,"(Advice) Need advice on my actions towards my girlfriend, suffering from depression.","I'm sorry, since this is a throwaway account. I don't want my SO to read what I'm writing. I hope this isn't a too unstructered text to read.

Things to know before reading: Me (22/M) and my girlfriend (21/F) are living in a long distance relationship. We both know each other since about 8 months and has told me about her depression, when I got to know her. She is suffering from depression and from an anxiety disorder for about 2 years, and has been in treatment before. Her illness is connected with the death of her aunt, which she doesn't seem to cope well with. 

Me and my girlfriend are in a relationship since 2 months now. She is the first person in a long time who was able to touch my heart, and is very caring about me. She showed me how much she loved me everyday. I love her very much and I know that she's a good soul. Although, this makes it even harder to watch her suffering from her depression. To let you guys know, it isn't about the honeymoon-phase for me. We had a good and long happy time.

Since we are living in a long distance relationship, I went to her place while I had vacation for a week. The first days were perfect, like those days when we got to see us the first time. It was the third time visiting her. So, at the third day in the evening she was kinda off, she seemed like she was thinking. I felt that and asked her if anything was OK. She assured me that everything's good. On the next day, when we both woke up she was distant and started to cry, where I tried to comfort her. At first I didn't know what was going on, but got to know later in the evening that she was feeling off because of her aunt, which had birthday on this day. Her aunt died from cancer as far I know, and had a bad time as hospital, from which my girlfriend told me that she had an huge impact on the familiy and isn't coping well with her death.. I also kinda didn't know how to act, since this is the first time somebody has been like that to me. So I tried to be supportive and didn't want to put any pressure on her. The following three days I showed her love and tried as much as I could to be normal, since I didn't knew what to do at all in first place. I knew she was suffering, but I also didn't know how to feel in first place, since her both cats and her dog got loved, while she didn't show any kind of affection to me. On the last day when I had to leave, we both spoke about those days, where I told here that it was some kind of hard for me, because I didn't know what to do. She told me that it was here fault, since she just couldn't show me any kind of love. She told me she was blocked towards me, but also got kind of soft from that conversation, where she hugged and kissed me afterwards for the most time. I got some kind of aftercare. 

So, since I had to leave her place she has gotten more distant and is isolating herself. She told me one week ago, that she is also trying to protect me from her behaviour, since she knows that she is able to end the relationship with it, but she doesn't want to end it. I asked her if she needed space and if I should leave her alone, where she has told me that I shouldn't leave her alone completly, but she seems to need space.

From what she has told me, she has been in the past in an abusive relationship and also told me that she isn't used to talk about her problems to anybody. Her trust kinda got abused in the past in the relationship and ""friends"". When she told me the first time that she loved me, she also warned me that she would probably get cold towards me when her depression is hitting her again, and that she's just wishing that I'm gonna get through it with her, which I'm ready to do. We had one evening, where she got sad and started to cry, where she's told me that she has anxiety being lonely in that time, since it is hard and doesn't want me to leave, which seems like persons have left her for her illness. She also almost got an panic attack when she's told me that, but I was able to comfort her. Another thing is, that she's told me that she is trusting me and feels massively safe around me. She also wants to get treatment again, but her circumstances right now wouldn't allow it.

Right now I'm giving her space and since those days, she is right now the most isolated and cold since then. She also sleeps much... So I guess she is suffering the most know. I'm trying my best to put zero pressure on her, told her I'm giving her the time she needs. I'm also reading and informing myself about depression, so I'm learning something about it, and also to be able to cope with it well. I've told her that I love her, and that she hasn't got to respond at any point to it, I would only like to let her know what I'm thinking. I also don't bomb her with my feelings right now, our message intercourse has since then shrinked to about 6 - 10 messages a day. It kinda seems like she is avoiding me... and I know overwhelming her right now is a big fault in my opinion, since I just want the best for both of us. I tried to call her yesterday, since she was on a concert on the last weekend(which she had tickets for months) with her best friend and didn't feel to pick up. She just asked me what I wanted and told me she was sorry, that she couldn't pick up.  


I would love to hear some advice on this. Is there anything else that I could do? Am I doing something wrong? How common is it, to isolate from their partner? I know she's sleeping all day right now and staying up, until late night and she is playing computergames to distract herself. Why is she isolating so hard from me, even though I'm close to her?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
699,Everything is always my fault...,"My life has been spiralling out of control, and everyone is pushing their problems blame onto me.

My dog is dying of bone cancer, and i got blamed for not picking up on it earlier. Shes now barely able to walk, and i then get blamed for “pushing her too hard” for trying to get her to go potty. “I never help” because im at work too much.

Im suffering at work due to stress and depression, and im getting yelled at for making mistakes and not trying hard enough.

Nobody wants me around because i always fuck up everything and i ruin everything for everyone. My coworkers are holding a Secret Santa, and i overheard them saying that they hope they dont get me as their secret santa, because ill probably give them a shitty gift. 

I have no more friends, my family blames me for everything wrong in our lives, and my will to live is just sinking deeper and deeper."
700,There actually isn't a single person I know who would trade lives with me,"Of all the people I know, be it family, friends or colleagues/acquaintances, I am 100% not a single one would trade lives with me.

Almost all of them have the ability to enjoy their life without overthinking or knowing it will be swiped at any moment. I have an eating disorder (diagnosed) so my life, even though ""recovered"", is dictated to by that. I panic (less than before) at restaurants or eating unexpectedly but then equally binge on anything in sight at times. I 'exercise' compulsively so if I can't stick to a routine I become very irritable. Basically my life is dictated to by something I don't want but can't live without as it's almost my coping mechanism/excuse.

But ignore all that. Let's focus on the rest. I am nearly 30, have no significant other (never have), I don't like the way I look (various reasons and partly due to the above), I never developed the social skills I feel I should have at a younger age. When in work meetings or social scenarios, if I don't end up throwing up or fall on my face I consider it a success - I am not as funny or witty as I'd like. So I a can't even be that 'funny' guy. I am just 'thing'.

Why would anyone trade lives with me? They are mostly all in relationships, with kids, just as good if not better jobs and don't have the constant wars going on inside their head.

I have tried, and still am, dating apps etc. and on the absolute rare occasion I get a match it never goes anywhere. My chat is usually utter rubbish as I panic and, as mentioned, I'm hardly a comedian. I can't rely on my looks to compensate for my lack of banter either. I've met up with 3 of them and went nowhere because I am more nervous in person. My fear of fucking it up ruins it as well. I see people go on them and when they say they get a kiss or more at the end of the first date I am baffled how. Oh and the one time I did tell someone I had an eating disorder, it ended promptly after - confirms that I am destined to be alone as I don't blame people for not wanting to deal with any potential shit from me.

Sorry about the incoherent rant but I had this thought today. Not a single person I know would trade lives if given the choice. Pathetic"
701,I don’t know why I’m sharing this,"I dated a girl I was madly in love with for 3 years. She has abandonment issues so there was always a struggle for power. Me being a modern man I did not mind sharing some control over certain aspects of our lives. She lived at home as a caregiver to her mom. I haven’t lived at home in many many years. However, things got tough for her at home and we had plans of moving out together somewhere very close to her mom so she could still go everyday and help out. Where her mom lived was very expensive. My girlfriend came from wealth so putting together 125k for a downpayment was no biggie. For me it was a HUGE sum of money it meant everything I had and some. I figured I would buy the house, buy the ring and had to save up for a wedding. I couldn’t do it on my own, so I figured I’d move to my parents and begin saving. Bad idea. I come from a bit of an abusive household. The moment I set foot in here depression hit. My Gf and I began fighting a lot and although I described to her I was going through depression, she swiftly ended it with me I guess figuring I wasn’t going to be quick enough with the home which is what she needed at the time. She’s the type to put her interests first. And trust me I know I dodged a bullet. However, I’m stuck at my parents at the moment and my depression is heavy at the moment. I’m trying to buy a place but being the holidays nothing of any interest is popping up. I’m 37 years old and I have nobody. All of my friends have children now. I feel guilty reaching out to them because they have a lot on their plate. I’ve been trying to get away on small weekend trips but the moment I get home all of these problems come crashing back on me. I can’t stand my job which I went back to after finally quitting to pursue something else because I needed the income to qualify for a mortgage for her. Honestly, this depression might be situational but it is crippling. Doing minor tasks is hard. I get home from work and do not leave my bed. The holidays are coming and I have time off from the hell hole i work in. I hope to get my shit in order by that time, but right now I can barely hit the post button. I want to talk to someone (I see a therapist) but I don’t have the energy to ring anyone up."
702,how can I feel alive again,"I'm 21 and almost 4 years I can't feel alive. I can't tell these anyone I know you all say go to doctor or something I know myself I won't do that. Life and his stuff are so competitive and I don't see much reason to fight for it. I think my problem is I can't define myself to me. It's like playing d&amp;d without character sheet but there is no dm to ask for it. I know I'm pussy in this subreddit there are people who lived the worst experiences and they don't complain. My worst thing is beside all that emptiness I still have an ego. and I feel deserve someshit somehow. and I still say this cause for my ego He doesn't accept to as a retarded.

this post was useless sorry for waste of reading"
703,"Depression is feeling like you’ve lost something, but having no clue when or where you last had it. Then one day you realize what you lost is yourself.","Quick vent - 28 (M). Have suffered previously during my teens from depression (skipped a lot of highschool to smoke a shit load of weed). Eventually smartened up, cut the weed, and drove hard for a career goal I now achieved. As well I gained a massive hobby in fitness (weightlifting, rock climbing, eating healthy).

Always had loving/caring family, and a few close friends. An amazing gifriend who I don't live with yet, but is definitely going in that direction. Have had a great decade really.

Lately, it feels like im drowning while everyone else around me is breathing as lots is going south lately. I am realizing my career choice will have very negative health effects (despite my high level of effort) in the long term, and don't know what I want to do. Sibling has a terminal illness and mother might be diagnosed with the same route. Feel like I can't talk to anyone, or want to. Struggle with sleep apnea, and irritability.

Really wondering... What's this life really worth? How do you help yourself to happiness if your truly lost?"
704,What I want to do,"**Vent**

So in class we were told to make an assignment about something we enjoy, want to do when we r older, etc.
And without hesitation I immediately think how i want to be dead. 
And like obviously i cant do this project on that.

I knew about this project for about two months now and it's due Thursday and I havent even started it yet.
I decided to do mine on editing because it is one of the only things I kinda half enjoy still, along with playing instruments."
705,I saw a psychiatrist for the first time in a very long time,"We finally got decent insurance awhile back so it became a possibility that I could finally be on medication. I got a prescription, but I don't think I should see this trist ever again. All she did was invalidate my living situation, my feelings and my financial situation. But this wouldn't be the first time a psychiatrist has been like this. Are they always so hateful? She diagnosed me with BPD, which I expected. But she told me I didn't try hard enough. That because I didn't have a job, it was my fault. I've applied for hundreds of places for the past few years, went to several interviews, reapplied, I had to quit one job because of distance and sexual harassment and the other because of my sciatica. I asked about getting on disability, but she told me I wasn't physically debilitated enough. When my partner is on disability for mental illness. It's hard to believe, but having a crooked spine plus nerve damage makes it extremely difficult to do anything overly physical. Even if I lost more weight, my spine would be fucked up. But it's whatever. There's also the case of you can't necessarily force people to hire you? So she also suggested well why don't you do volunteer work. I live in an area where that is non-existent, and if it doesn't make money, it's a waste of gas money to my parents. Which is fair, I get that. Money is always tight here. I told her I also couldn't drive. My parents have almost no desire to teach me, I brought it up to my mother again a night ago, and she said nothing about it. But the psychiatrist assumed that it HAD to be possible for public transportation or getting some stranger to drive me. 1. There isn't any. Not even in the nearest metro area which is actually really weird imo? 2. Hitching rides with strangers is incredibly unsafe. So yeah. That happened. Was a shitty appointment. I'll probably find a different psychiatrist if need be, but hey I now have medication to look forward to. So that's something. Mental illness really sucks. Especially when it's been put off so long because of financial reasons."
706,I'm finding it hard to believe that everything will be ok,"This seems endless. I can't stop medicating. My life feels like I'm stuck in a whirlwind. I've ""cured"" my depression twice but gone straight back in after a little while. I am also becoming more and more scared of death because I think it will be endless loneliness, which is what life feels like."
707,"Liked and loved because ""I am funny?""","Not the best descriptive to boost the male ego. Not 'good looking', not 'strong', not 'protective', not 'intelligent', not 'talented', not 'skilled'. Not any of the normal things a man deems to be important or good qualities. 

Wife (33 years): ""I love you because you make me laugh."" Old and best friend (36 years): ""Likes the things that make me laugh."" Met wife's coworker for the first time last night, less than 5 minutes interaction, today tells my wife: ""Your husband is funny.""

My life is just being a depressed court jester."
708,How do you reach out to your friends without being needy?,"I’m at a loss. I’m at a place in my life where I really need to talk to someone i know. Either in person or over text. But since middle and high school (I’m literally in college now) I’ve had people tell me that I’m annoying and needy and just looking for attention when I try and talk about stuff. That’s not at all my intention. I hate attention and if I could deal with everything myself I would - but I could really use somebody right now.

The other issue is that most of my friends are guys. I have two female friends here in college and I’m not close enough to them to even begin to talk about it. I don’t know how to talk to guys about this stuff. I’m afraid that they’ll just think I’m a dramatic girl who’s trying to get attention. Again, I’m not. I’m having a really hard time. 

How should I start the conversation? I have absolutely no clue what I should do, but I could really use the kindness of a friend right now."
709,My life has changed so much this past few months.,"I have a job at Bi Lo, I went to 3 job interviews, I got a debit card, I made a bank account, I made a resume, I got a ID and I'm in a house with people that care about me and love me. Even though depression has brought me down so many days that I didn't want to wake up, I fought that depression with the fear of losing the home that I lived in to be away from my abusive parents. 
Even though many things that are upsetting happened along this road that I'm on, I fought this enemy that haunts me to this day. And to anyone who says to themselves that 'I can't do it' or says that they are worthless. You arent. You are alive and are worth many things. You will be depressed to the point of not wanting to get out of bed but you can do it. You can do these things you never thought you could. You either just need a push or will yourself through. 
You are loved."
710,I’m lying to everyone I know and living in a fantasy world so I can just forget,"Im out of control. And I don’t know how to fix it. And I feel sick about it.

I’m lying to my friends that I’ve totally broken it off with my ex who I was firm in breaking up with a couple months ago. They all don’t like him because I only vented about the really bad stuff after awhile. I know he’s not good for me but I haven’t let go. I’m not in love with him but I need him. He’s my best friend and only real friend. And he drew me back in.

I’m lying to my boyfriend. In my mind, his verbal abuse and mental abuse and cruelty pushed me away. I ended things in a way, went and got my stuff. Told him I wasn’t happy. He’s pulled me back in but he’s more committed still than I am. 

I went on a few dates. Because I was lonely, resentful, sad, angry. I won’t get into how bad my relationship got with him. But bad. I’m being selfish because I can’t let go but he’s also holding on to me for dear life as well. I didn’t sleep with anyone but I kissed someone I’ve had a crush on for about a month whos in my grief group. 

I’m lying to guys because I’m on tinder and bumble dying for some kind attention and validation. I don’t spend much time with my “boyfriend” anymore yet he hasn’t ended things with me. We never have sex but he hasn’t ended things with me. It’s not nearly as serious as it was before... but he says he sees a future still. He’s been unemployed for 10 months and part of me feels he’s just sticking with me until he feels better about himself. Cause I no longer give him much of myself anymore. He pushed me too far. But we still text and talk all day long. It’s co dependent.

I’m lying to nice guys who really want to date me. 

I feel like the worst person alive. I’m lying to my mom telling her I’m eating enough when I’m not. She sends me money for food and I spend it on going out, or clothes, or bullshit that gives me an adrenaline rush of some kind.

I’m either super anxious about all the lying or super numb. Almost as if I’m justified in my lying because I’m hurt and I’m broken and I’m let down by almost all the people I’m lying to except the new guys I’m talking to occasionally and the two I went on dates with. Only kissed one of them. 

It’s all scum bag behavior and I hate myself for it. I rationalize it all that my boyfriend was abusive, I told him I wasn’t happy and got all my stuff from his place but never really see him but he thinks we are committed still. I rationalize the spending money on the wrong things because my mom made so many stupid decisions while I was growing up it affected the course of my entire life. It started my anxiety and depression. I rationalize lying to my friends because they’ve set me up to do so. They treated me like crap if it ever seemed I was going back to him so when we stopped spending so much time together I just said yeah it’s done. I thought it was actually but then it wasn’t and I just never brought it up. But these aren’t real friends. Not really. So I rationalize that too. That they stopped being there for me a long time ago anyway. That my boyfriend as bad as he’s gotten has been there for me more than they have been. But they love to judge me.

I’m living in my own world just Plato bf by my own rules and sometimes it makes me excited and happy again and then I realize I’m building this house of cards all built on lies and it’s all gonna crash on me.

I’ll lose everything and I don’t know how to set any of it right.

I know I should leave my ex. Stop talking to these specific guys. Tell my friends I am still seeing him sometimes and we do still talk. 

Start using my moms money correctly if she is helping me. 

But I’m so depressed and so anxious and so miserable, it’s like all of this that I’ve started has become some bad addiction. I just want to go out and have fun, and hang with guy friends I wasn’t allowed to hang with before, go on dates, pretend nothing shitty is happening. That my dad isn’t dead, that I’m 32 and my relationship of a year ended up horribly, so horribly that I’ve technically cheated by kissing someone else. Not close to being engaged or a mom. No close friends. Lost a job I loved. 

I want to erase it all. So I sleep in late, I wake up, I lie to whoever I need to lie to and go play whatever role it is that day. I go out and get drinks, I dress up and feel pretty, I hang with people who are fun and will talk about interesting fun things to distract me completely from everything. I get lost in it. I go home around 2, maybe eat something maybe not. Go to sleep. Repeat. 

It’s been dates or friends or seeing my boyfriend briefly and not being intimate because even he never initiates it anymore I don’t know why he’s still with me, or going out and having fun, shopping. I start a new job soon so I’m hoping that grounds me back to reality somewhat. But the lies are still there. 

I never thought I’d be this selfish. Ever. But I am."
711,Switching meds,I’m going from 100 mg Zoloft to 10 mg of Lexopran. Does anyone have advice on how to make the symptoms of starting new meds not as intense? I got really nauseous when o started Zoloft and increased it so I have a feeling the same might happen to me again. Any advice is appreciated.
712,"If I owned a gun, tonight would be the night I'd kill myself.",I am so goddamn tired of my job and having multiple bosses.
713,I wish I could go to therapy.,"I feel like I have a lot of problems I need to sort out. Therapy, from what I hear, is usually the first recommended option. 

Unfortunately, I can't afford it and it's not covered with my health insurance apparently (I'm still on my parents/families; whichever it's called). I've had conversations about therapy with my parents in the past, but it always ends with the cost being too much. I know it's not their fault and I'm not blaming them, just in case it sounded like I am. I'm just frustrated knowing I need help, but can't get it.

I really hope I don't sound like some kind of jerk or anything. Not my intention, I'm just confused about all of this and feeling low (again)."
714,When will new treatment for depression come?," There have been a lot of news about new treatments for depression, like  ketamine. When do you think new treatments will come? 5years, 10, 15?"
715,"I don’t enjoy anything in life, and don’t even stay in the moment..","I don’t know what to say, I enjoy playing video games but in a way I don’t even enjoy playing video games they just get me thru the day so I’m not battling thru thoughts in my head..

I’m not even hunger thru out the days now, I just don’t even see a point in eating, makes me feel sick..

I just want to sleep all day, and not wake up anymore it feels like I just want to be in some peace and silence for once..

I’m about to turn 20, I’m still living with my parents.. not going college or nothing, I don’t see a point in working yeah you get money to pay your bills and keep doing that.

I have 0 motivation to work or do anything in life, my parents just see me a lazy kid and call me that and so much more, there not wrong There right but I just don’t want to be alive..

Some days I wonder why I even try, but remember all the stuff my parents did for me and how greedy it would be to just end it.. sometimes I just wish I could kill my self without putting guilt on them that they had something to do with it.."
716,I’m sick of keeping quiet so I wrote this.,"Little backstory: I am US military and live in California and I’m from Texas and am in Texas on leave right now.

I am constantly feeling alone and want somebody who actually cares to have me around. I have 2 people right now and legitimately I just feel like I annoy them with me constantly being over while I’m in Texas, but I want to maximize the amount of time I spend with them while I’m home. When I get home in Texas or go do things that I think I want to do I just end up feeling annoyed or angry and it’s an endless cycle of being angry. I will even just lay around and feel annoyed and then depressed and just cry for an hour. I just feel so annoying and constantly depressed to do anything. Work is fine, but I have had constant thoughts of shooting myself or hanging myself at home in California."
717,Just woke up in the middle of the night and can't stop crying. Please help.,"It's 03:26 am for me. I had a bad dream and in the past few weeks I really pushed my bad feelings away and now I can't stop crying. It's like all the emotions are here. I can really feel something. Help, it's too much.
My friends are not awake anymore."
718,You realise you 're alone when..,..you put your phone on airplane mode for 5 days straight and have no missed calls when you switch it off. Cause noone really never missed you
719,I feel good.,"I plan on leaving soon.  I have to say I actually feel relief. It's finally coming to an end, the hopelessness, the disappointment, the calculable misery. I feel pretty damn good. I even stopped paying my student loans. I figure I might as well enjoy my money before I go. I've stopped caring, knowing there is a light at the end of the tunnel is invigorating. I don't want to spoil any of my friends/family's holidays but knowing that this is going to finally be over in a few weeks, I can't tell you how...free I feel."
720,FUCK ME!,FUCK ME!!!!!! I was soooo stupid to even think anyone would ever love me.
721,From intense despair to absolutely nothing?,What the fuck. Unbearable despair to barely sentient apathy. Why?
722,Depression denial and invasive thoughts. Just want to share,"I've come to realize that I'm a person who internally denies that my depression is as bad as it is. I had a weird childhood in foster care for 10 years and bounced around home to home. Since I was a kid I figured it was easier to just ignore all of my feelings accept being nice and helpful to people  because it's easier not to feel anything and live a hollow life and people will generally like you. I thought it was my best chance at survival in a social world and it worked really well. I was well liked and no one ever saw me as anything but happy. 

I honestly live life on auto pilot and I hate it. I don't know how to form solid relationships. I've never had one because of my own apathy and helping because I thought it what's expected. 

The only time I truly feel anything is during certain times listing to music and when I have invasive suicidal thoughts. I often walk across brides and my mind just says jump. Or I'll sit at the ocean at night and seriously debate just waking in and floating away. I feel something. I don't like the feeling but it's something. But I think about it and always decide against it. I tried 4 or 5 times when I was in my late teens but the issue was never really addressed. The woes of being convincing and ""normal"" 

I don't drink at all or do drugs but I do partake in quite a bit of flower to keep myself level. And it's very legal where I live (26 m) 

I feel ok at the moment just needed to get this out. I have no one irl who I would be able to tell. I normally just get lost in music but been having a hard time lately. I hate this time of year. Being lonely is like a social prison sentence. I've done it for so long but the older I get the worse it feels I feel like I'm losing my mind and I hate myself because I can't seem to get life figured out. I've seen glimpses of normal happy baseline life and it's so elusive."
723,Anyone else feel like a burden to everyone around you?,"I feel like a burden to everyone i know, my parents, my friends, my relatives etc. My parents are so good to me and support me no matter what and i still can't do anything to repay them. I achieve nothing. Seriously don't even know how they can stand me anymore. My friends are they same thing, sometimes feel like they just hang out with me out of pity or just good manners or something."
724,Do I have depression?,"For forever I have felt like absolute shit. I've lost all energy and motivation that I used to have. I struggle sleeping and when I do, it's for too long. I feel useless, worthless. I always feel sick, and I am tired 24/7. What am I?"
725,Any ideas for getting even the slightest bit happy for the holidays?,"Not going to sugar coat it or anything, but my new born daughter was taken and hidden away from me 3 days after the birth by the mother and blocked all comms. Not only would it be my first and only child's first christmas (a child ive always wanted, but got lucky after hearing years i ago the chances of me impregnating a woman were extremely low) it would also be her i month bday on the 24th. All of my family but my mother havent spoke to me in years and this christmas just feels...i dont even know. Ive never felt this heavy of a depression and pain in my life. So i was hoping maybe you fellow redditors out there may have an idea or two for something i could do or see to help make this holiday season even the slightest bit enjoyable?"
726,"Today was kinda crummy, I want to kill myself.","Lost an account for a game I’ve been playing for 3+ years, made a fool out of myself talking to someone I’m into, and just failed to do anything good or productive.  God I’m an idiot"
727,question for those who have taken trazodone,"did you lose or gain weight, or did it remain the same?"
728,my medicine,i take 40 mg of prozac. i have been taking it for like 3 months now. (starting taking 40 like a month ago though)  i want to say it doesn’t help because i still breakdown a lot. what are antidepressants supposed to do? they’re not supposed to make me a zombie but i’d like to be one instead of feeling like this. should i try a different medicine &amp; tell my doctor?? :/
729,Physical and mentally can't recover from this.,"Last 2 years been hell I though I hit rock bottom then found another and another. Filed bankruptcy 2 years ago, wife leaves me and won't let me see my daughter. I lost everything and had to start anew, from being homeless to drugs. I got super depressed last year and tried to commit suicide last december, I almost succeeded, 14 days in ICU. I got addicted to oxy as a drug to help boost my mood,  I abused it and was spending all my money on it drugs. I decided to get help and get clean, and I've been sober 11 months on Suboxone treatment. Everything was going good again, my medication was keeping me stable. I got a good job, good pay and benefits, then the owner sold the business and 2 weeks later I was laid off with no notice. I was devastated as this job was something I really enjoyed, I tried to find another job with no luck. I filed for employment insurance and they give me $640 bi weekly. I was given the opportunity to go back to school through this program that helps people on employment insurance get funding for school. I was all approved until the very last minute they told me I was not qualified because I didn't have enough hours worked. So I did apply for a student loan and got that, 2 week into school I get a call and I was told I was reassessed and they took $2000 from a grant I was given because I made $6000 in 6 months. 
I'm barely making ends meet, well I'm not. I get 650 biweekly, my rent is 700 Pou. I'm left with 400 for my car payment, insurance, food, gas, etc. My insurance alone was 160$ because I'm in a ""high"" risk zone. I finally found a job that can work around my school hour, first week was good 3 hours a day. Not much but it helped, the second week my boyfriend gets a call that his mother had pressed charges on him for uttering threats which she later dropped. But not after having to drive 8 hours to his hometown where the court house was. lost 3 days of work, I also missed my Suboxone treatment and was going through withdrawals for 5 days before I could see the doctor again. 
Then Monday I get a call for my court date to fight for my right to see my daughter, thing is it's tomorrow, they gave me 3 days notice. The court house is 6 hours away again! So Monday I went into work, then today...having a shitty day, I scrounge up enough change to buy me and my boyfriend couple of Mcdoubles cheeseburgers. At this point I've been up for almost 36 hours because if the anxiety about my court date. I was driving down the road and I got dizzy and rear ended someone, I have a broken car, court date tomorrow and if I miss it I won't get to see.my daughter this xmas. Got to deal with the insurance, headache.

I'm just sitting here writing this, it may not even be read, or may not even be readable I don't know. My head is pounding since the accident I literally want to drive my car until I kill myself or down all my pills. I'm done, I've been a firefighter and only to be shit on because my wife left me(her brother was hi higher up the ranking pole than me) I have nothing. I don't know what to do, I've tried to get help from the government but because I'm getting employment insurance I'm denied, but people on social services get more than me."
730,Help,I usually don’t speak out online about stuff but I just feel like there’s no other place to run. Me and my ex girlfriend used to talk every dang hour of the day and was with me every hour so I never felt lonely. Well she’s gone and she was my best friend so I don’t have anyone to comfort me on this topic. I don’t know what to do. It seems the more I try to get over her to more the hurt drives deeper into me. It’s almost been 2 months since she’s been gone. I’ve never needed her as my best friend more in my life.. I’m sorry for bothering y’all on here. I’m just feeling so lost and like there’s no meaning to get up no more. I’m slowly losing motivation to do anything again. I feel like such a wretch.
731,I always feel like I screw things up unintentionally,"I am a Highly Sensitive Person who also suffers from anxiety and depression. Because I always take things so personally I sometimes feel like I've done something wrong, when on the surface I didn't. For example, I was worried that someone I cared about was overworking themselves so I asked if they were ok. The way they responded felt like they weren't taking me seriously and then later I felt like I offended them because of how they responded. 

Recently, I asked someone out and they politely declined (nothing wrong with that). 10 minutes later they posted on social media how annoyed they were getting asked out all the time by guys they weren't interested in (same person told me this personally a few times too). Maybe it was coincidence, but I took it as a personal attack towards me and I sunk to a low mental state.

So I want to ask, is there a way to stop being hard on yourself and always taking things so personally, even if they may or may not be about you?"
732,I'm still depressed and I don't know why,"It's nearly Christmas, I'm surrounded by family and at university, I have friends who I really care about and who mean the world to me. Despite all of this, I still fantasise about dying (not killing myself) and I still feel depressed and those feelings of not wanting to be myself won't go, no matter what I do. For so long, I thought If I expanded my social circle, got a relationship (which I now have), I would finally be happy. I just don't understand what's wrong with me..."
733,Telling people much problems,"So a couple of my friends have caught on that I've been down in the dump lately and they ask me if I'm doing alright and in which I reply with okay and then they tell me that if I'm having much problems to tell someone that I can trust and unfortunately with me I can't trust anyone any.ore due to the last time I did, my ""friend"" I told him that I was afraid of the dark (I was in grade 11 and this point) and he decided to tell my entire animation class about it in which everyone mocked and made fun of me for the rest of the semester. Anyways, so I decide to tell one person who I can REALLY trust which is my mom. She was driving me home after work one night and then I started telling her about how I've been feeling lately and all my problems and in which she replies with a long lecture on how I'm ""fragile"" (like in a bad way) and that my opinion/problems don't matter and I should keep everything to myself for now on"
734,Am I wrong for this? Or am I overreacting?,"So my boyfriend and I just got together 6/7 months ago and before that a girl he was talking to because it’s his high school friend would send him nude photos all the time. At the time he told her to stop and apparently she has since we started dating, but he still talks to her on and off all the time. I don’t like it and every time I try to bring it up he gets mad. I just don’t want him around her and I feel like I’m gonna lose him to her.

Help."
735,I just don't feel like me,But wat is me wat should I feel like I feel like my clothes and skint wrong. Idk wat I want or who I wanna be who I am. How am I supposed to feel. Wat do normal people feel or think. I don't understand
736,Sometimes it just doesn’t feel worth it,"I never had serious depression issues until I just had my baby 3 months ago. At first everything as perfect and like felt amazing and it feels like so fast my that has changed. It’s started to wear on me having to literally do every single little thing even though I am the mom and that is my job everyone needs help here and there. I feel disgusted with my new body even more so then I had before. I can barely find happiness in anything anymore. Only thing that makes me happy is seeing and holding my baby. I feel like a burden to everyone in my life and everyone would be better off with out me. Countless times I have thought of leaving in the middle of the night to do something so my boyfriend can’t stop me. I love my boyfriend with all my heart and the love has ever grown stronger since having my daughter but he doesn’t understand. I try to talk about emotions that I am going through and to him it’s just a repeating circle that he is tired of. So that just makes me feel like even more of a burden and just want to end it all. He has his own stuff too with bipolar disorder which causes him to basically treat me like his emotional punching bag when he is having a bad time. We he gets mad he has no problem telling me every little thing that is wrong with me and things I do. Even though when things are better he apologizes and says he doesn’t mean it, I can’t just move on and act like what he said wasn’t said. I am just tired. I’m tired of it being a problem when I need help. I’m tired of no help. I’m tired of feeling not good enough. I’m just tired of life and I want this to stop."
737,I was wondering,"If I were to die, would my brother stop treating me like shit for once and actually pay attention? All I ever wanted him to do was to watch me play Breath of the Wild."
738,In my defense,"You ever feel like you're hurting people because of your own pain? You ever feel like you're the cause of all their stress? Everyone always tells me I'll be okay. I've tried believing them for so long. All I had to do was bottle it all in, right? No, no that's not what you do at all. Everything builds up and eventually it'll all come at you at once. I opened up for the first time in so long but I knew what was going to happen. I never open up because someone always gets hurt whether it's me or someone else. I opened up, I talked to people, I went out to distract myself from everything. Yet as always, I hurt people unintentionally. I didn't want to be hurt anymore but in doing that, I hurt everyone else around me. I don't open up because I know what's going to happen. I don't open up because I don't want anyone to stress over me. I don't open up because I don't want people to feel bad for me. I don't open up because I don't want people to feel the pain I do. But everyone is telling me to talk to someone. I did. And now nobody waits to talk to me. I doubt anyone is going to read this but I just needed to let it out. I'm sorry for everyone I've caused pain to. I'm sorry for turning to you for help"
739,This is weird? Am I overreacting? Is different wrong?,"Hey guys 21 y/o M. I not really sure what to think. I haven't really been on this thread much but i have always thought about posting on it. I'm not really sure if there is something wrong with me or not.

First I work with in a family business, agriculture. Long hours and I not a huge fan of it. The reason I stay is because I think I can work to an early retirement and have all the time I want to do things. In high school I always thought be were just overreacting or being sensitive when they were ""depressed."" I was successful in high school. Good in sports and in school, but I can say that I was never ""happy.""  a Maybe not sad but never happy.

This has gotten worse lately. I had friends in school but always considered myself a loner. I am fine with that (i think). I enjoy the free time and time to myself. I would say in the past year though I have been feeling really weird. I am not afraid of death but I don't really want to die, I'm just kind of indifferent. I have noticed that things I like, like exercise, video games, and writing have become completely unfun. I feel like it is pointless to do them because I will just feel down after I stop doing them. I have realized that I am very nostalgic too. Listening to music from when I was younger or from a video game i played in the past makes be feel very bad. The sad thing is that I really like that stuff.  I don't like to just go with the crowd either. I want to be different, but the more that I do things I like, the sadder I get. It is really weird. Sometimes I feel better just doing things more standard and trying to block out sad feelings, ,but then I feel I am not being true to who I am. It is hard to explain and very weird. And I know I won't feel happy with myself in the long run.

Another thing that is weird is I only feel happy in my dreams. Maybe this comes from identifying myself as an artist and thats where a lot of my ideas come from, I don't know. Also dreams just interest me. Sleeping has replaced a lot of my free time. I used to go to bed late, but I am usually asleep by 9 now. 

My family is also very religious. I believe there probably is a God but I do not know which religion, and I am completely open toward there not being one. We are a very fair right leaning family and me and my brother are a lot more moderate. I bring this up because it is hard to explain my feelings to my family other than my brother who is a few years older than me. Thanks for any help guys."
740,this is the first time i have only been on one medication since 2013. Psychiatry has failed me,"In February 2013 I was diagnosed with ADHD and in March 2013 I was Prescribed my first adhd medication

over the next 6-7 years, i have taken tried every modern treatment (bar Celexa, Brintellix, Mirtazepine, and older antidepressants) in many combinations, some many times for depression &amp; anxiety &amp; adhd. None of them have fixed me like I believed, which was the only thing that kept me going through all the years of isolation, pain, loneliness, &amp; pain i went through. I went from somebody that was extremely motivated and with lofty dreams, to somebody who now believes his life is over and the best never started. I have also gained 80 lbs due to the weight gain side effects of a lot of these medications.

Lyrica was the last anxiety medication i could try and hope see that it could help, and it doesn't. In fact i learned the hard way that lyrica and the other popularly prescribed gabapentinoid, Gabapentin, have been one of the reasons my adderall was not working at all.

Since I do not have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, it does not make sense to take any of the medications I haven't tried left.

I am not the saddest and most depressed I have ever felt, but I feel dead on the inside and have officially lost hope on life which is one of the chief criteria that happens before suicide is the likely outcome.

Now the only thing I can do is go back to therapy with my therapist, and try all of the nootropic health supplements, that for years I have felt don't work and have no FDA approval for their claims, to see if they help my cognition at all, because Adderall alone does not help. In fact i don't know if I'm going to even take adderall, and go with Strattera instead, because last time I remember it gives Adderall gives me headaches.

All I know is that psychiatry has failed me, and that there is no hope for my life because i know that I have no power to change who i am and self improve any longer. Therapy is ok for venting but I don't benefit from talk therapy because my emotional know-it-all nature prevents me from listening and remembering people's advice, and learning from my mistakes.

I could use some emotional support"
741,My depression,"You know you’re worthless
You know you’re a loser
You know nobody cares
Why don you think that they would
Look at yourself 
You’re disgusting
You want to die we both know it
Why don’t you just do it 
No one will care
Be the selfish person you are and die
Do it
Just do it
FOR FUCKS SAKE DO IT
ALL THIS SUFFERING 
ALL THE DEPRESSION 
ALL THE ANXIETY 
ALL THE EYES
ALL THE FUCKING PAIN
END IT FOR BOTH OF US 
PLEASE 
please
You don’t understand 
I feel like you think you should live
But you shouldn’t have existed
The pain won’t stop until you die
Have mercy on me and yourself 
Just end us
please.

742,"None of my friends truly hate me when I'm depressed, but they do when I'm not...?","This'll need some explaining. For the past couple months my brain chemistry has been relatively normal for lack of a better word, so I'm much more comfortable being myself and being an self-sufficient individual than I was for over a year. I've been really productive lately and just got hired as a bassist for a touring project that's about to release an EP and I've just noticed that since things have been on the up and up for me, some of my closest friends just kinda don't want me around anymore. It's odd because when the inside of my head is just death, I get asked to do things with them all the time when i would rather curl up into a ball and die. Now they won't even attempt to start a conversation. I feel like I'm missing something but I couldn't have if I literally did nothing to piss anyone off. It's just a weird observation, maybe someone else has experienced the same type of thing."
743,Level 44 is my cap,"So for the past 3 years or so I've jokingly been saying that 40s is my cap. I'm going to check out. And now, I feel I'm more comfortable with that. 44. I dont want to worry about retirement, about others, about work, about money, getting weaker, fatter, older, etc. 44 seems like.a decent life lived."
744,How do you deal with feeling like you’re born to lose?,"24M. For most of my life all I’ve had was my hard work. All I did was try my best, and sacrificed a lot to try and get good employment to pay back my parents. And yet now graduation is near and I’m single and yet to find a proper job. I look around and see my peers with no mental illness living and enjoying their final year in uni with their loved ones and secured good jobs. And honestly, it just fucking sucks. I can’t even get one small thing going for me right now, and I’m so fucking exhausted I don’t really wanna leave the bed. 
I don’t know what’s the point of all this suffering, because at this point it’s not building me, I’m numb to any further lessons and I’m so scared to hope. I don’t know what to do."
745,I'm so frustrated.,"They all say ""Don't be afraid to ask for help."" and so you do, you go everywhere you can over the years, because what else can you do? Your parents. Your grandparents. Your relatives. The only people you actually have access to. 

None of them believe you. None of them listen to you. They 'care', but not enough to do something that actually involves caring. Better to wait until you basically aren't alive anymore to do something. Then, when and if it gets to that point, ""we didn't realize you needed help that badly."" They won't acknowledge 1.) the help is NECESSARY. 2.) They had a part in it, they didn't step in when they should've. No, it's your fault. You didn't let us know how much you needed it. Something about sobbing in the living room, saying you cant do this anymore - saying you just cant handle living, didn't hit all the right bells for them. 

They all say ""It isn't weakness to ask for help."" but they forget that some of us are actually surrounded by people with that view. People would be perfectly happy going on with life while you literally rot, and expect you to act happy while doing it. They'll pretend they're actually going to help you, and keep talking about it, infact, they'll tell all of your relatives that it's getting taken care of. 'It'. They might take you to a counselor or a therapist like, twice. Three weeks apart. Good enough, you should be good to go, right? It wasn't the counselors fault for not fixing you, we don't have the money for this and you just weren't listening. 

We also expect you to function as a human being and get good grades while you actually suffocate in low self esteem, bad memories, physical and mental exhaustion, apathy, emptiness, and while you flip between being content with your depression and hating it so much that you want to die. Also, no complaining allowed. 

I'm sorry, I don't know why I wrote it like this, it's just too painful typing in terms of ""I"" and trying to be coherent. I'm in constant brain fog and I just cant. I'm sorry this is rant-y. I don't know where to post, what to do. I have nobody to talk to, and I don't know where to go. I'm so exhausted."
746,i tried killing myself last night and now i just feel empty,so last night i tried to od on my insulin and sleeping pills to hopefully die in my sleep of hypoglycemia but i failed and gorged. i feel so empty i was betting everything on not being here today i distinctly remember waking up and hoping i was in some kind of afterlife that mirrored my room but no I'm here and i just feel empty i hate this so much this is my 3rd attempt this year and i still somehow fucked it up
747,How does therapy help,"I feel like if you already know everything they’re going to say, how can it help 

Never been

32 M with very little left to love for"
748,I finally got help but it was fruitless,"Last night I became so agitated and upset that I contacted the mental health line (run by the state mental health department) telling them I was having very intrusive, involuntary suicidal ideations that were getting to the point of me becoming physically agitated. The person on the phone told me to ""do some yoga"" &amp; try to ""do some deep breathing exercises"" ... like....WHAT? Then they cut me off to answer another phone call in the middle of our interaction. They finally told me to go into the community mental health center to have an assessment done by a physiologist which I just got home from. 

I sat there for almost an hour telling them that I have no one to talk to, that I have been dealing with bipolar/depression for almost 10 years and I wouldn't be seeking help if I wasn't worried about my safety and the power that these thoughts had over me. I began crying begging for help but all I got was a few phone numbers, one of which was a grief counselor because I told them I lost a close family member about a year ago and basically ended in them asking for my partner's number so they could 'keep an eye on me'.   

I walked out of there feeling absolutely defeated. I reached out for help and got palmed off. I don't know what to do anymore, if the systems in place that are meant to be there to help can't help me then what else do I have? I'm sitting in my bed drinking a beer trying to psych myself up to go to work in 4 hours &amp; I just wish by a miracle one of my major organs would stop working so I could get on the bus &amp; gtfo of here."
749,I need help,"I was diagnosed with depression and i attemped suicide twice this month and I really need to help mysef to get myself out of this and I can’t even stand myslef anymore,please i need any advice"
750,I can't handle it anymore: without meds and on the verge,"Well, I can't handle anymore. I'm without my meds (I take Valproate, Sertraline, Olanzapine and Clonazepam) and my mother doesn't want to buy them. She alleges we have no money even though my dad, since he has ran away from home (for the third time in this year), has wired us some -- she and my sister have spent some money on sneakers, tattoos and on their fingernails. On this Sunday, my sister (she's 15 and I'm 17) did beat me. I felt humilliated and surer of my suicide and I felt even more humilliated today when my mother joked about how often my sister beat me -- I feel specially sad when my sister treats me like that because I tried to get some help for her and I even got her a transfer to a nice school (which she rejected). I don't want her to lick my boots, but I just want her to act more decently with me. I mean, one week after they found out I was suicidal, they badmouthed me to some cousins, knowing that I was hearing it all -- my mother said I was like ""God's punishment"". I can't really handle it anymore. I thought of being commited to a psych ward, but my mother said she doubted I would even kill myself, even though both my therapist and my psychiatrist recommended it I tried talking to my psychiatrist about it but all she said was that she couldn't do much and that things would get better. Besides my father (who's got Bipolar and is addicted to Clonazepam), who has ran away (although I don't blame him for doing so, once my mom planned to kill him with her lover and she recently invented that I had tried to kill myself by jumping in the middle of a busy avenue and tried to guilt-trip him with this), my mom (who's got Bipolar and BPD), and my sister, I have some half-siblings. The one who I tried to reach out and who even offered me a hand, disowned me (""you should forget I exist u/souththroaway), promised me suffering (""you will now know suffering"") and called the cops on us out of hate for my mother. I thought I had any friends but after high school finished this month (I lived in the Southern Hemisphere), they simply forget about me. It bothers me that it seems that in seventeen years, nobody has loved me. It bothers me that I'm not sure if everything is real or not. Everything bothers me."
751,Do y'all work?,I've always had trouble supporting myself while dealing with depression. How do y'all support yourselves? Any advice?
752,Help/Advice/Opinions Please,I feel very disconnected from people. I am in a relationship and i have a very loving family but I think I treat them all badly. I have been told I am selfish. I have been told it's not like I'm not even alive. I have zero motivation. I am tired and lazy all the time. I don't think before i speak or before i do things. I let things slip and i am very careless. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THIS. I feel like something is wrong with me. I want to care about people and i want to have energy and motivation but it doesn't matter i just don't. I have felt this way on and off for 6 years. I am not self aware either. I just want help and advice.. I want to be a human again.
753,A success story.,"(Male, 23) Many suicide attempts, mostly in my youth. Countless scars, real and figurative. These are only memories now and I'm not that person anymore.

So many awful years of self hatred, sad eating and laziness made my body unappealing. One day after being disgusted with my reflection and seeing what depression has done to me physically, I decided that I'm not going to let this sickness control me any longer. I started dieting, exercising and showering everyday which has worked wonders on my state of mind. That doesn't mean that I don't still get depressed sometimes but now, when I do start to have shitty thoughts, I do something productive to make myself feel better and it's worked every time.

Lifestyle changes aren't out of reach for anyone and it makes a difference. Everytime I think about how fucking depressed and helpless I felt and didn't try to do anything about it… it makes me so angry how easy I gave up and how I could've been doing this years ago. Anyway, now that I'm on the right track I wanted to let anyone who's struggling know that there are solutions other than medicine and therapy… solutions that you can manage yourself because 

#You are in control of your own destiny

Helping others, dieting, exercising, smiling, showering and being productive. These simple things have changed my life and you can do it too. Find your motivation, set goals and get there. You've got this and I'd tell each and every one of you that everyday if it would help. 

Special thanks to r/intermittentfasting for showing me the way to looking and feeling healthy.

#Keep your head up, you can do this"
754,Why is everything getting harder,Like just existing. I dont even mean tasks. Just living with yourself everyday.
755,they’re giving our cat away,"we have had this cat for 2-3 years and we got him when he was very young. i’m really attached to him. he has been peeing on a lot of things, but then he stopped and my parents thought he stopped for good, but today he did it again and before that he had done it so much they had to get rid of the couch.

they’re telling me that they have to give away our cat and i can’t fucking do this. i’ll be wondering every day about where he is, is he alive or not, is he in a loving and safe home, is he happy, will he miss us?? will he be sad when he leaves?? i can’t fucking take these thoughts. as much as he hurt me sometimes i can’t stand my parents giving him away. i won’t know what will happen to him and every day i’ll come out of my room and wonder where he is, then remember he’s gone and i just can’t fucking handle this."
756,I am too afraid to ask for help.,"I go to therapy. I take medication. I still want to kill myself every single day. I’ve contemplated jumping off the second floor in my school, out of my window in my room, off of the balcony off of the deck. I’ve considered going through our medicine drawer and taking every single pill I could find. I’ve considered jumping out into traffic, crashing my car, starving myself to death, willing myself to die. I am too much of a coward to actually go through with it. I am also too afraid to tell my parents or anyone how I feel because if I got put in a pysch ward I would 100% kill myself, I would find a way to end it even if they if they put me in a fucking straight jacket in a padded room. My parents also get angry whenever I get upset or voice my feelings to them because my shitty mood inconveniences them, and I don’t want them to find out at all. I do not know what to do and honestly it might just be better to end it because I cannot live with the shame of being labeled as the suicidal maniac in my family or my school or my friends. Does anyone have any advice at all please it is an emergency. I can’t even tell my therapist because she would tell my parents"
757,My 21 month old brother is way smarter than me,My brother is 21 months old and he is already reading books aloud in English and Chinese. My step dad is Chinese and I still only understand just a few words of it to know when his aunt is calling me dumb and ugly. I learn a Chinese word and forget it 20 minutes later. I am mentally r*tarded with severe depression and dyslexia. I failed everything in 8th grade and have to repeat it because I missed too many days. I'm a failure in many ways. Everyone hates me. I should just kill myself. I have no friends or anything.

You are always there for me
When I'm sad and lonely,
You keep me company

Thank you Depression, my best friend
You are always there for me
When I'm tired and can't sleep,
You drain all my energy

Thank you Depression, my best friend
You are always there for me
When I'm starving and thirsty, 
You make me not hungry

Thank you Depression, my best friend
You are always there for me
When I'm bored and alone,
You help pass the time with suicidal thoughts, occasionally giving me panic attacks as I realize life isn't enjoyable oh my god what's going on I'm shaking it's happening again

Thank you Depression, my best friend
You are always there for me
When I panic and can't function,
You help me fake it for all around to not see

Thank you Depression, my best friend 
You are always there for me
When I'm even slightly better,
You know I can't be happy
 
Thank you Depression, my best friend
You are always there for me
Because if it weren't for you, I would be
Truly happy.."
761,What’s the line between turning depression into an aesthetic and sharing to the Internet as a coping method of sorts?,"I know somebody who constantly posts those ‘haha mental breakdown time’ things on their instagram story. And she posts about how she hates things, and her ‘sad bops’ or whatever. She posts about seemingly every little thing that could bring about sadness. I just wanna know what others think the line is between turning it into something to flaunt, in a way, versus a way to cope-? I don’t know. It just frustrates me so bad that she posts it so constantly. Is that bad? Am I just jealous she’s able to get the word out without feeling like a guilty, complete and total burden? Because I’d never be able to admit to anything like that, besides the occasional, vague comment, or joke to cover stuff up. But I’d like to hear some opinion. Am I wrongfully getting super angry/upset about it?"
762,I need help.,"I’ve never been officially diagnosed but I feel depressed all the time. I’m 17 and I feel like my life is falling apart. My grades are shit, I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend but I feel like I’m loosing her too. Everyone I know is mad at me for things that are out of my control. I’m just loosing everything in my life. My parents don’t know how I feel. I try to just put on a happy face whenever they’re around. I want to go see a therapist or something but I can’t do it without telling my parents. But if I I feel like that would just make my situation worse. They’re not exactly the supportive type. I just want to feel happy."
763,I just failed my first class in college,"It’s not so much that I failed that makes me so upset, it’s the fact that I really did try. I don’t know if I can afford (both financially and mentally) to take it again. I feel like shit right now. Seeing my grade made my heart drop and I feel so embarrassed and disappointed in myself."
764,I have no motivation or energy,"I've been increasingly losing motivation and energy to do anything over the last couple years, but it's gotten much worse over the past 6 or 7 months. It clicked about a week ago that I may have depression. I'm currently a junior in high school, and I was considered one of the smartest and hard working kids in elementary and middle school. I have big plans for the future and know exactly what I want to do and how I'm going to get there, but I have no energy to actually do anything. I've completely screwed arguably the most important year in high school. I've barely done any extra clubs or activities after school, my grades have been slipping, and now I'm stuck trying to catch up on work. But the closer I get to the end of this week trying to get everything turned in, the less motivation I have and the more stressed out I get. I'm not necessarily sad, I just have zero energy. I don't even have energy to get on my phone or play a game for more than 30 minutes at a time. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm just trying to get motivation for the rest of the week, and I'm seeing a therapist on Thursday."
765,still cant get over it,"the person i loved most of anyone in my life hurt me more than ive ever been hurt l by anyone

i still cant stop thinking that i am genuinely worthless and everything she said about me was just her being honest for once

i still cant stop thinking about how hes better than me

i still break my head trying to understand how she could do any of this

my heart is still empty and broken and fucked"
766,Can't even relate to the concepr of happiness,"Been reading a lot of posts on here, where people are basically saying they want to feel happiness again, and to have people around who care about them. Understandable. But - what if you don't even have these references? What if you're so broken ever since childhood you have no idea what happiness is, what not having constant anxiety attacks is like and what having kind and caring people around is like because you never experienced it even as a little kid? I can only picture happiness as the absence of pain, that is a void of sorts. The absence of emotions. I can't even imagine what having a ""normal"" life would be like since I never had it. I can't ever get one, because how can you build when there is no foundation?"
767,How can I not hate myself?,"For me it seems especially hard to let go of hatred, especially towards myself, because of all my mistakes and missed opportunities. Even tough I also feel hatred towards others who have done me wrong, I have an easier time forgiving others in comparison to myself. Recently I have started therapy again and was advised to stop hating myself, because it will not get me further. So it just holds me back and prevents me from changing. For me though, I find a lot of reasons to hate myself for.  To keep it short: Any advice on how to stop hating oneself?"
768,I fucking hate myself.,"I hate myself with a fucking burning passion. There's not one person on earth who I dislike more then myself. I literally just stare in the fucking mirror thinking about what a shit stain of a human being I am. Why the fuck am I like this? I'm not the same anymore. I dont know what to do anymore. I'm so fucking lost, I wish I was a blissfully ignorant kid again just fucking around in my backyard playing in the grass. I miss feeling ok about myself. I dont know who I'm looking at when I see myself in the mirror. I've lost myself, I dont know who I am anymore.

Fuck"
770,Always Happens,"It's like my life is a game, a game I really suck at. I unlocked so many achievements, formed a great team, and finally felt like I was getting somewhere. But then whoops! Game crashes and I forgot to save beforehand again. Everything I accomplished resets and I'm back at the beginning. I see everyone else still leveling up around me while I'm just stuck here alone once again due to my own stupidity and lack of any skill. I feel like a fool for thinking that it would be different this time. I always sabotage myself, what happens to me is inevitable. This game isn't fun, it's sick and I'm so tired of being tricked into believing that I'll ever make any progress. Why don't I just log off already?"
771,Do any of you enjoy your jobs?,"I’m in an industry with a high turnover rate. 16 months is the average of how long someone stays somewhere. Anyhow, my last manager wasn’t giving me great references apparently and my new one is very unsupportive and ignores my emails. I have more work to do than one person can handle with no end in sight and when I’ve mentioned it I haven’t gotten support and have only gotten more stuff to do. I guess I just assume it’s because I’m awful. Part of me thinks I’ll never have a job I enjoy and this is all I’m destined for so I’m wondering if any of you have managed to find something you actually like."
772,"For the first time in 21 years, I genuinely feel like I'm loved and not alone in this.","I've been feeling like the world has come crashing against me. I was going to therapy every other week, working at a job I loved, working on getting a house of my own with my fiancé, getting my dental/medical records back on track, things were good. Then my insurance changed, I lost all the money I had saved up for the house because I had to pay all my medical expenses insurance no longer covered. My therapy went out the door with my insurance, not that it would have mattered anyways. My car started breaking down at that point and I couldn't take it out of town to my appointments, just to and from work and to the grocery store once in a while. I lost half my crew at work and started hating my job after pulling 2x, sometimes 3x my own weight, staying late at night and coming home exhausted every day. My car has been probably my biggest heartache, I used to cruise around at night singing my soul out on the nights where things weren't so great. My car finally broke down completely last week, had to push it home and find another way to and from work that night. I had no idea what I was going to do. I felt so alone. I woke up this morning and took a second to reflect on this past week and I realized I'm not alone in this. I'm the furthest thing from ""alone"" in this. My stepdad has taken some PTO this week to help take me to/from work and so we can go and look around for a replacement vehicle. My mom's offered to sign as a coborrower on a loan for me and has offered me one of her old cars temporarily to help me get around town in the meantime, all I have to do is pay for a new battery, get it registered, and fix the flat on the back tire. My finacè has offered to match the payments on my loan to help me get it paid off quicker and has offered to help pay for the expenses and do the labor part of fixing up my mom's old car (he has a car of his own, but the title is lost and we're waiting on the guy that sold it to him to send us a new one so we can get it registered in my fiance's name). A coworker of mine who I used to give rides to when she left her boyfriend and another coworker I would pick up and take home when she'd have a little too much to drink both offered me rides to and from work, no questions asked. Both my main boss and my supervisor have told me to call them if I need a ride at any point, and another coworker of mine has stayed with me until midnight every day this week to not only help with my workload, but to also make sure I had a ride home and got there safely. She could've easily clocked out and left at 10 with the others, but she stayed just to help me, ""what do I have to do at home anyways?"" She says. I've had my brother, my grandparents, and my future in-laws help give me rides around to the places I need to go (stores, bank, etc.). My cousin has been sending me used car listings she's found on Facebook all week and my stepdad has been sending me craigslist ads he finds online for used cars. Another one of my coworkers handed me a card earlier this week with information on how to do financing through a bank if I decide to go that route. Last night, I was lying in bed crying to my finacè about how disconnected and invisible my depression has been making me feel lately.  Today, the weight on my shoulders feels just a little bit lighter and everything looks just a little bit brighter :)"

774,"8 Years Of Battling, How/When Does This End.","Since I was 14 (Now 22) I have found myself in a battle with my feelings, thoughts and emotions everyday for the last years and I honestly don't know what I can do to bring positivity to my life, my thoughts, my feelings and emotions. Now how long do I carry on going on for fighting all this negativity every day of my life do I give up and give in to this and just fully breakdown and concede to this long war that I have been involved in for over 2,000 days or do I carry on this war to see if there is anyway I can get the upper hand on what is making me feel so bad and awful inside.   


Now I have set a goal for myself in the short term and the long term but I am doubting these goals myself but my heart says that I am doing the right thing by setting these goals, I want to move out of parents house, I want to move out of the town I live in as there is nothing here for me will that make me happy I don't know but the dream of it all gives me a small bit of hope, at the same time my mind is telling me its all a waste of time and I will regret all this when it happens, I will just feel like an idiot. Because of this i am questioning whether or not I should invest my time, heart and energy into my future.   


Am starting to feel and think that 2020 will be the first and last year i see of the new decade I hate myself, I think I am an awful person I really do and I can't bring myself to explain why cause to some you will probably think its something you shouldn't take so serious but because I feel like I am a caring, thoughtful, kind and honest person its brought my to tires and sleepless nights for the past few nights, I can't forgive myself for being so selfish and thoughtless, because of this I feel like I have lost any chance of the possibility of having a chance to date the lady I feel deep down in my heart is my soul mate and the beautiful lady I will love for the rest of my life but I don't think I will get that chance no matter how old I am. 

Now these thoughts are all about my relationship ending 8 months ago its deeper than that boils down to family problems, where I live, insecurities, lack of self confidence they are the foundations to how I feel so awful inside. For me I feel like I have ran my course for my life and I don't think I have anything else left to offer to this world we live in I genuinely don't believe I have anything I could possibly give to anything or anyone anymore.   


I am a lost cause with lost hope and I don't know what to do with myself. Does this end with my ending it once and for all or do I force myself to battle though and hope I somehow get an opportunity in one of the big cities and see that as a fresh part of my life and to leave everything else behind me for good.   


So many questions, So many ideas and yet I have little answers and little logic for both."
775,People with depression do not need a doctor and a bottle of something that rattles. They need a pair of running shoes and fresh air.,"Yes, this but unironically. 

Depression, is not like asthma, or diabetes. There is no blood test for depression. There is no magical cure like an inhaler or insulin. The only diagnosis is based on symptoms. The only medications are based on clinical trials that have often failed when replicated.

Get off reddit. Go outside. And meet people. It's the formula that humans have been running on for millions of years. You're not an exception."
776,I need to hear some late starter success stories,"I'm 32, I have literally wasted the past 5-7 years. No relationships, increased drug use, increase in general and social anxiety, decrease in exercise, laziness, loss of motivation, losing social circles...literally the only thing going for me right now is I have a job, some money and a house, although I am not moving anywhere in my career and the company is essentially cutting most of it's workforce but at the current point in time, I am still there so that is something I can be thankful for.  


I have a few goals I need to achieve to head into the right track, I want to box at an amateur level, try judo/bjj, read more, travel interstate / overseas more, form new relationships, create music, finish the project car etc. I have kept delaying all of these, it is really terrifying at how much time I have wasted and I am struggling more than ever.  


I have come to the realization that I am a coward and the only way forward is to face my insecurities &amp; fears head first, I am no longer going to cower away from adversity or the fear of the unknown. I will probably be dead within 50 years, is it really worth saving the potential failures or embarrassment just for some temporary comfort ? Eventually, no one is going to remember. Hell in 150+ years civilization will barely even recognize who the Beatles are.   


I am not throwing in the towel. I'd love to hear some success stories of people who struggled for a large portion of their life and changed their direction or people who would consider themselves, late starters."

784,In the closet.. Feeling suicidal and trapped.,"Hi

I'm 24f, bi female in the closet. I have been extremely depressed lately and dealing with thoughts of wanting to not be here anymore.

I live with family at the moment due to not having enough to move out. I save up with my job, but I don't have enough yet. They are quite conservative and religious type. They have said plenty of times how disgusting they find lgbtq relationships.

I have had a relationship with a woman before who I loved very much, but never told my family. I hid the relationship and now I seem to be in a similar situation.

There's a girl I like that I'd like to make a move towards. I'd like to ask her to hang out some time, but I just can't do it. I'm afraid to be myself and I'm scared to be kicked out with my family if something potentially happened between another female and I.

And I have debated on telling my best friend but I'm also afraid to do that. She is quite supportive of lgbtq, but I'm scared she would just treat me differently. All of this has just made me feel so depressed and horrible. I feel so trapped and like no one would care if I was here anymore.

I fear I will just be alone for the rest of my life due to my fear of coming out. No one understands me here. I can't relate to no one. I just am tired of it."

And if i choose to live again. Im gonna go through worse. Suffer more. Anyone got any advice on how to prepare for death? And if you wanna convince me otherwise. Please give me something other than a complicated ""hope for the best"". Im tired of that."
794,Stuck between a rock and a hardplace,"My official diagnosis is depression caused by ADHD. From my perspective honestly don’t know what to think of it. My parents love me very much so does the rest of my family I lived a relatively Comfortable childhood we were pretty well off. Home was never the issue though it was the kids at school it was the kids at swim team it was the kids in church. My parents always told me how handsome I was and everybody over the age of 30 was always super super nice to me but most of my peers were not like that at all. Most of them said mean things and the other half didn’t say anything at all and the ones that did say something it almost felt fake. I’m 22 now I work tech-support I didn’t finish college and I live with my best friend and his girlfriend. The living situation is nice but Living with a couple even if it is your best friend is not very fun when you’re single. When I’m not at work are usually spend most of my time in my room door closed with my bearded dragon. I feel guilty for having depression because on paper I had a pretty good life and I still do. I guess a better way of putting it is I feel guilty for never feeling like anything is enough. It’s not necessarily that I want to kill myself, it’s more I don’t wanna feel this anymore And suicide is the quickest and easiest way I can think of to just have it stop but that would be at the detriment to everybody around me. I feel like I could write an editorial but all the struggles that I have but the main issue is the ADHD part because with that I’m unable to keep a coherent thought process longer than 30 seconds to a few minutes without losing train of thought. Just say that I have trust issues would be a huge understatement I don’t really trust any of my doctors Enough to really tell them everything in fear something might complicate life for me. Every time I try to talk about something like this with my friends or family or doctors, I either get short answers like do better try harder or they say I don’t know. The only thing I know how to do is put it over to the side and keep moving forward and hopes of a better day. But every Day “better” Seems further and further away. I just wanna be able to talk to somebody to tell them literally anything without any fears of looking differently or sounding crazy or pissing somebody off. I’d also rather not overwhelm them because all the stuff that goes on my head it’s more than I can manage. I’m sure there’s thousands of other comments and Posts on here so this might go unnoticed but at least I know that I said something and that makes me feel little bit better.To anyone else struggling with this,Fuck what anyone else says I love you and I’m gonna say it again I love you. Depression is manipulative and makes you feel alone I just want you to know you’re not alone and I love you I love all of you."
795,I feel like I just cant anymore.,"I've tried for so long and I've been strong for as long as I could. I'm tired of constantly being reminded I'm a failure and constantly being told my best isnt good enough. I'm tired of never being able to get ahead and never being happy. I've gotten so good at faking smiles that my real one gets called fake. I feel defeated. I've got no drive, no will. Nothing. Theres just nothing left. I want to give up.."
796,Help me please,"I am doing it now...

I am sorry Dad 
I love you all"
797,I think what I feel is worse than a knife in my stomach,"I wish I could stop over analyzing every single thing that happens and every thing I feel. I’m in such a place that when someone doesn’t respond to a text instantly, I wonder what I did wrong. I’m tired of being in pain my whole life, in a way that can’t be healed no matter what I try. I think it would be less painful to have someone stick a knife in my stomach than it would be to continue to suffer with a chemical imbalance that consumes every inch of my body."
798,depressed but not depressed?,"I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety 8 years ago when i was 14. I started taking meds and they helped me to some point - but i’ve always knew i was just a shitty person who can’t do anything right. I was good at nothing and i was demotivated easily.

My meds helped me with my fear of people, i was able to go out in public again, but some part of this fear was left inside me. I’m very desperate for people’s attention but i’m still scared of talking to them because in my mind - they all hate me and talk to me because they don’t know how to get rid of me. My social skills are awful, when i get to know someone it gets better, but when i’m trying to make new friends i always feel like i’m a burden.

I wish i could find love but i’m just too afraid of what people will think about me and of people rejecting my feelings, because it happened in the past. When i was 17 my very obvious crush was revealed to the boy i liked and all he did was laugh at me, to this day it makes me think everyone thinks i’m a joke and that I’m not worthy of love.

My motivation is nonexistent, i can’t get out of my bed, i can’t clean my room, i can’t cook dinner, i can’t take a shower. I just have no will to live but at the same time i feel like it’s all my fault because I can’t force myself to take my meds regularly. I take them and then something in my head tells me to stop and i just stop. I feel like i’m just inviting everyone to my pity party just to get their attention while i could be doing something to get better. Is it normal? Does any of you have the same thoughts? Do you have problems with taking meds regularly because you just can’t find enough willpower to take them?"
799,Antidepressants are not for me,"I smoke a lot  weed daily and and feel extremely lonely I know what I need I just don’t do anything about it I just sit in my room and do nothin I feel like
My mental health is deteriorating my anxiety is making it so I can’t live a normal life I
Lost all my fiends because I don’t do anything my moms upset with me also I just go to work to go home and feel like a failure (dropped outta high school) I’m 17 still one my problems is not trusting any therapist because is my past every time I made a connection with one they moved away and shit hurts I was left with no one to talk to now I just don’t talk to anyone and everyone’s pushing medication on me I just feel lost and broken."
800,Hey,i’ve been thinking about this decision for a couple months now and i’ve decided to do it tomorrow i can’t take all the pressure and have been going strong for a while now. I don’t think it will change anything but ima miss reddit i had a very good time on this app had a few laughs it’s been lit
801,Anyone despising God for creating you?,"For a long time I had this idea to be buried with an AK47 so that when I die I’ll take this gun and hunt Jesus down for creating me, seriously. When I told my therapist she had to laugh seeing the sight of two spirits going after each other, she’s an atheist. Currently I doubt he even exists and think some people are just made to suffer and feel miserable, like some sort of punishment."
802,What makes your room cozy? - Help me cozy up my room and recommend me something specific to add please,"Hi!

Help a fellow sad human out. My room feels incredibly off. Lights help, but it's missing quite a bit. If you have a favorite thing, or things that you'd like to recommend: link it. i love you and thank you so much for helping

805,"Whoever you are, wherever you are, whatever you’re battling ..",Hang in there. From one stranger to another I believe in you and I hope you come out the other side stronger and ready to take on anything that comes your way.
806,My doc fucked up my prescription and made me worse,I've tried so many meds that I don't remember what I have or haven't taken.He gave me wellbutrin to take once a day. I got worse. He blamed it on withdrawals based on the timing because it was not extended release. He said many people take it several times a day. Well why the fuck did you give me something I'd withdrawal on? That seems like a dumbass thing to do to a suicidal patient that's been depressed for over 2 decades.
807,I’m killing myself tonight.,"Basically, I’m in between a rock and a hard place. My apartment is a mess, I’m getting evicted from my apartment which will leave me 7000 in debt plus my other debt, I gave my dog up tonight, my ex left me, I’m losing my job, and I’m so tired of existing. I was abused at a very young age and my heads been messed up since. It’s like I don’t function right. I can’t take care of myself basically. I’m just tired. I’m done. So tonight I’m cleaning up all the shit in my apartment, I’m going to go tell my sisters I love them, I’m going to hang out with a friend I like, and then I’m going to go home and do it. Probably not something to put on here. No one understands depression. I talk about how hard it is to care for myself, get up, go to work, and etc. and it’s like I am not doing enough. No one understands ptsd. I want my siblings to know I love them. I’ve fought this my whole life. It’s the inevitable. Not sure why I’m putting it here."
808,"Those of you who knew people that committed suicide, what did they do the weeks prior?","For context, I have about a week left to live. There's nothing that will save me and I hope my mom and dad do it after I do she doesn't have to go through pain. It's a long story but I can't go through this anymore. Is anyone else planning on jumping off a high tower or something? Has any of who ever attempted by jumping? What stopped you?"
809,Everything fell apart,"Heart got broke, gave it 6 weeks, I met another girl we started dating then I decided I wasn’t ready and she disappears and I haven’t talked to her or seen her since. I don’t even know if she is alive. I haven’t been a speaking to anyone I have barely any friends i have a past of trying to drown myself and I’m thinking about it again, I have purpose in my life but I’m just so fucking lonely. I miss human contact and I can’t smile anymore. I’m failing in almost all my classes and I just can’t find motivation to do anything."
810,First Post in This Sub,"Hello. I've been trying to keep it from coming to this, but there's no more denying it. I have to know I'm not alone.

I was diagnosed with anxiety about 3 years ago by a family physician. She put me on Lexapro, but I eventually stopped taking it. All it did was give me longer breaks from ""the heavy"" as my wife and I called it. But when the heavy broke through, it broke through in anger and frustration.

I was referred to a psychiatrist in town, but surprise, surprise, no one picked up and I could never get an appointment. No one around me knew who else to go to and Google only returned that same doctor.

Anyway, life goes on. I stopped taking the Lexapro and life was ok. Nothing I couldn't handle through a little meditation and quiet time. My wife is so supportive, she could tell when I needed some time and she let me have it.

My family and I moved 400 miles, kind of overnight. One day, we discuss the potential of moving, a month and a half later we're here. House sold in three weeks. God paved the way. There were way too many boxes to have checked for it to have happened that quickly.

I don't use the word hate. I cut it out of my vocabulary. But the past 3 months, I've employed it bitterly and repeatedly to describe this house, this city, and this job.

About 3 weeks into moving here, I had my first heavy hit in over a year. A week later I had a panic attack, something I've never had ever. Since then about 3 days out of every week I feel hopeless and paralyzed.  Yesterday was the worst. Today was bad, too, but yesterday was debilitating.

I feel stuck. We have a very high monthly overhead due to old debts and loans. Our rent is higher than our mortgage was, our car insurance went up 250% due to a different state. Our son's daycare is expensive... It goes on and on.

We moved here because I got a significant raise and my wife was going to be able to keep her job and work remotely. Everything was going to be fine. We had $7k left over from selling the house.

We find out before the first week was done that my wife's boss never intended to let her work remotely and she was being let go. (You think he could've mentioned that before we moved 400 miles.)

It's hard to complain about that as she's now working her dream job, albeit with a 60% decrease in income.

Now, money is an issue. I can't make less money. Great Lakes, Navient, our bank, and the IRS would arrive with even a slight dip of income. I can't make the money I'm making anywhere else that I've found for my background and skillet.

Then I found out my new boss is..  one of a kind. I've never been spoken to like that in my life and I've worked for tyrants before. Every day he makes me feel inferior and has openly told me and others that he made a mistake offering me what he's paying me. He mentions that about once a week. He isn't mean, per se, but too candid for his own good.

I don't have a lot of pride, but what little I have gets stomped on daily. To make things worse, the work he's having me do is nowhere near what I was told would be in my job description. It's mostly scanning and filing. I spend 9 hours a day in a 4x5 cell staring at a computer with little to no human interaction.

I spend 3 hours in traffic every day, leaving barely enough time for family time and self care when I'm home. The time I do have at home is spent cleaning and doing chores.

I have zero friends here. Not one. I was certain I would have some by now, but 3 months hasn't even gotten me a ""what are you doing for lunch?""

My wife and I had a church we loved and regularly attended before moving here, but after searching, we haven't found anywhere we'd like to serve. We finally settled on a McMega Church we don't really enjoy.

I have pumped my life full of God's Word and good podcasts and self-help and I just can't shake this.

I can't work. I'm paralyzed and incapable of doing things that need doing. Making the bed feels like climbing Everest. My mind feels like a wet blanket is wrapped around it. It stops me from feeling happiness, joy, or enjoyment of any kind.

Everything online just says ""stay positive, eat well, get enough sleep but not too much, drink water...""

Uh.. I KNOW THAT. That's the thing about depression. It attacks my will to fight. It suppresses my resolve. Forget my will to fight, I'd settle for the will not to want to be dead. I'm not suicidal, but I'd be lying if I don't sit at work thinking I'd be happier with wings.

I also won't because my family would waste away without me and they mean everything to me. I've also tasted the joy of life and I'm not hopeless I can feel it again.

My only medication is escape. Watching YouTube, browsing the web, and playing video games are my only ways of coping. We can't afford health insurance, so I feel lost there, too. The money we had left over from the house dried up quickly.

I'm tired of feeling hopeless and trapped. I feel like I'm out of options. God, help me."
811,Hello,Love this sub. Sitting and smoking a few cigs 83 days sober any one up for a little chat
812,Send a letter to Santa. An update for the jolly man.,"Dear Santa,

I haven't written to you in a while, I believe last I wrote to you was in 3rd grade, back when Isaac wouldn't give back my DS and I asked you to buy me a new one...I miss Isaac. I haven't aged a bit, I mean physically yes but mentally is the same shit. I still feel sad and hollow, I still want you to make me happy; but I'm not asking for that right now.

So I never ended up dating that kind girl back in middle school, I miss the way she made me feel. It wasn't sexual, nor would I consider it love, but it was simply pure happiness. The lonely man's love is called obsession, huh? Could you blame me, though? In a world of black and white, the slightest color was enough to make me happy. I also miss the way she dressed, always wearing these lovely sweaters making her look so cuddly. I had problems being touched then, trauma and all, but all I wanted to do was hold her hand. I gave her these shitty gifts and poems hoping she would make a move on a creepy stranger, and when she did say hi I got scared and backed away. She was so frustrated when I did that, like she really did want to be friends. ""It's ok,"" was what she said. I miss her. I wish I tried, I wish I wasn't so scared of her. How can you miss someone you've never met? It makes me feel a special kind of anger when I remember myself backing away, the kind that rises into the air like a firework only to explode and gently descend. The last time I saw her was behind the class, laughing with her friends. She didn't bat an eye at me. I hope she's okay, I hope she's not like me. I want to see her again, not for a chance but just to say thank you. A part of me knows that's a lie, I'd look at her and then leave. I ask for love yet distance myself, I truly do deserve death. There's so much to say about her, yet so little to say of myself. Some match, right santa? I wish to have a long and lovely dream, a dream in which I'm with her. Wake me up when I mess up. But please, make it long. Make her smile at me one last time.

Hope you're still reading santa, I know I never was a good person but hear me out, please. Consider it a final wish. As you can tell by my poor writing, I stopped going to school once my depressive episodes kicked in, grades dropped and the school gave up on me. I knew said girl was going to that school so I followed, expecting her to be in my classes (she wasn't). People weren't as mean in highschool, just neutral---you either hated me or didn't care. I wish I went to school and tried to keep up with work, being depressed and financially stable is better than being depressed and poor. And then there's isaac. We weren't friends, but I like to believe we were, like I like to believe you're real. Nonetheless, I wish we were actually friends, I wish I had friends. I wish I wasn't so lonely.

Anyway, enough with the venting, the rest of my life is the same shit I always told you about. Basically, I'm feeling awful and I wish to have a long, heavenly dream, and never wake up. I'm scared and alone, please give me mercy. It hurts.

Sincerely, IEHRC

P.S. yes I still think the acronym is cool and catchy"
813,"I sometimes genuinely smile and laugh, but I still feel nothing...","There are moments where I know I am happy, but I don’t feel it. No matter how happy I am, that numb, empty feeling won’t go away."
814,Energy,I wish I had the energy I had when I was five. Looking around I notice people talking and joking. For me it takes energy to just smile.
815,When am I allowed to give up?,"Those Days, when you make a plan, wanna do it but Just cant? When you dont have the strenght to leave your room and all you wanna do is Just break down and cry.
How can you push through when you have zero energy. When everything Just goes the wrong way.
I kinda was keeping it together but I Just can any more. The tipping point was my dentist today. Everything turned upside down... She told me that a have a gum probelm and that almost every thing Will cause them to bleed.
So imagine this. Its 1 am, you wanna go to sleep, but then you see yourself with Dark circles around my eyes, bleeding gums, blood every where and only one thought... Please give me the power to end everything...
Help me, please"
816,Xmas and new year alone,"In a foreign country, argued with thr only person i know here, he kicked me out of apartment, only had one week to find a new place (at the end i did) and he will fly away for holiday and im alone here.

How to cope?"
817,I am playing video games,"I used to play video games to amuse myself, and just relax. I haven’t done that in almost 7 months. Today I tried to play my favourite game. Counter Strike Global Offensive. I remember that I was trying to be a professional player, training every day. I played the game today. I felt nothing."
818,Is it bad to want a friend that understands crushing self hatred?,Idk just feel kind of stuck and lonely. I wish it was easier to make friends. Lost motivation from not having friends in so long. And now I'm just ready to die. I'm so sick of being me. I wish I could be someone else. If people liked me and I was just happy and good at things and everything was easier. Ugh. I just want to die but like I dont know what to do I just want to escape from myself.
819,"Start small, you will get there","Only 8 months ago I was slithering out of bed to the floor to force myself to do 5 sit-ups, barely pushing past 3. 

Today, I rode for 30 minutes on my exercise bike, followed by 50 crunches, 20 push ups, and a 2 minute plank. 

Today also marks 30 days since I last felt even slightly depressed after more than a year of missing out on life. I am so happy I stuck around, proud of myself for where I am now and where I’m focused on going. 

You got this, too. I promise."
820,My first post here since i just found this subreddit while having another attack of depression just to ask,Is it dumb that I try to search anywhere someone to talk to when I feel depressed for another time because I have no friends nor someone to talk to? Is there some way to forget about your depression without spending money on antidepressants or any of that stuff?
821,Tired,"I am just tired of people, those with love to step on and judge those without. A person in need will always face the wonderful people that will step on you for asking for help of any kind...it’s a wonder why real karma never comes to those people, comment after comment for what? How does this make people feel better about themselves? I try to focus on what good is left in this world but sitting in the dark and the only light seen someone jumps in front of it just to make themselves feel better and leave others just... eh what is the point. My deepest wish anymore would be the ones that do this were the ones that have to pull the trigger on who they so thoughtfully wanted to judge and watch what they cause. If the world worked this way maybe then others can learn"
822,Juul is coming off shelves tomorrow.,Goodbye old friend.. your harsh and tasty rips will never be forgotten my guy..
823,Thats all folks,I just wanted to thank/apologize yall. Im quitting all social medias and jail myself to home. I feel so horrible watching anything in social media. Everyone has all so good and are happy. Taking trips around the world etc. And im sick of it. You made me manage somehow. Thank you and bye reddit!
824,I've never been diagnosed and I dont know how,"When I was 12 I started to feel depressed but never told anyone because I figured it would pass, Im 16 now and never told anyone but I think its depression. I have weeks where I feel nothing at all and I cant focus on anything. I want to try and get diagnosed and helped but I don't know how"
825,Tonight is not going well,"I don’t know what is wrong, I just keep feeling worse and worse. I know I’ll be fine by morning but... I just wish I had someone here. I dunno. Life’s shit, shit’s hard."
826,Slipping back into my depression/getting some things off my chest,"I'm on mobile and English isn't my first language, sorry in advance for any mistakes. It's also 1am here so I hope I won't make any typos.

I've been depressed since I was 9y/o and it has had it's ups and downs. Lately I've been slipping back into it and I don't have the energy to get myself out of that spiral. I used to be able to and I don't know what caused me to fall back into it. I have a new boyfriend (we've been together for only 3 months so yeah, still fairly new) and I'm studying something that I really enjoy at a great university. 

But it has been so overwhelming, I have no friends at uni and rarely see my two best friends. School has been causing me a ton of stress because it's a LOT of work.

On top of that I get super frustrated over stupid and small things to my boyfriend. I can't bring up the energy to talk about why I'm frustrated to him which makes me snappy and irritable which is not fair towards him. 

I feel like I don't deserve him, or anything. I'm just a waste of space and I feel like I'm worthless. My friends were upset at me last week because I haden't texted them for a while but I just cannot bring up the energy to do so... 

This post is a lot longer than I anticipated, sorry."
827,I hate being sober,i'm not an addict i just fucking hate the feeling of being sober everyone wants me to quit but i'm only happy when i'm fucked up what do i do ive been in therapy for years ive been taking medications for even longer

829,"I can't hardly see or hear, so what's the point.","Over the past year, my ability to see and hear has decreased detrimentally. The tinnitus in my ears grows louder everyday and even something 5 metres away is very blurry now. This makes me feeling hopeless and depressed. I'm only 18, so I can't imagine how damaged my eyes and ears will be by that time. Music has always been an important part of my life, I play in bands and listen to music constantly, and to have it taken away from me because of some unbeknownst thing messing my ears up for no reason. I have been the doctors about my hearing and all they could recommend was using oil to remove wax from my ears, but this did nothing, and I have been to the opticians a couple of times but glasses don't do anything aside from making my sight worse. FUCK! I am so miserable; I don't know what to do!"
830,Just a bit stuck on life at the moment tbh,I don't really know if Im allowed to do this but if anyone is free tonight to just chat about life or just random shit that would be cool or if anyone wants to talk about anything then I'm all ears id rather do it over something like snapchat because its easier but just PM me first ... hopefully I can talk to a couple of you later
831,I hate my face,I hate my ugly face.. I can't even smile because my teeth are so ugly and yellow. I didn't care for them at all in my teenage years. And now they're all fucked up. It makes me so depressed seeing people smile and have white pretty teeth... I feel so disgusting I should just kill myself
832,Help,I just want life to end it's just a cycle wake up go to school stay up till 2 go to school feel depressed all day come home play games in my bedroom alone and it repeats I just want life to end but I don't want to so it I just want it to end
833,"Lost, that’s how I feel","I’m not clinically diagnosed as anything, never saw a psychiatrist. 

That said i often feel down but it’s not only feeling down anymore. I feel alone, pressured to be and do things i don’t want and mostly sad. I don’t even know why anymore. I’m just sad even when I’m with friends. Expect for drawing, i can’t seem to enjoy anything. I’ve lost motivation to do anything even basics things like eating. I’ll just forget to or not care to because i don’t really feel like eating. It has been only 3months since I’ve been living alone on weeks day and still live with my parents on weekends so i at least eat correctly on weekends. I just want to sleep all day everyday and maybe not wake up. I’m not suicidal, I’ve tried to cut myself and I’ve thought a lot about throwing myself in front of trains but always backed off. I love my family and my friends and i don’t want them to lose someone. I know i won’t be missed by many but the few people i care for would. I think. I don’t know how to get my motivation and happiness back since i don’t even know why i feel this way. 

I always had trouble sleeping (well as long as i can remember) but it becames worst since a couple years ago. (my cousin would often not let me sleep by calling me at night, which led me to sleep really few hours a night or not sleep at all for 3 days in a row. I got used to it and can’t sleep correctly even now.) I’ll sometimes catch myself laying on my bed for a whole day not doing anything. Not even look at my phone, just lay there and wait for the time to take my shower and maybe eat if I’m at my parents house. I don’t want to die but i don’t want to live either. It would have been easier if i just wasn’t born at all.

If someone read this thanks for your time and have a nice day."
834,I'm going to let my inner child speak its mind. Wbu?,"That one little person that is me in my truest form, since I was born, is who I'm going to reach out to, no matter how hard it is."
835,Don't know what I'm going through but it sucks..,"So, this friend of mine whom I know since couple of months, rejected me and I am totally sad. I stay awake all night just thinking bout her or a sad song playing on loop in my head or wasting my time on phone. I am so angry with myself that I feel like a complete loser. This feeling is so familiar that I am tired. I want to be free. I have no self confidence, I get hurt by small things easily, I can't stand it when people make fun of me. Don't know what's going on. I'm working in a good Japanese company, I cleared my 3rd level of japanese exam but still I feel totally empty. Friends started making fun of me now because I trusted one of them and opened up but as usual they are all just thinking for themselves. I'm totally tired. I tried meditating but just 2 days I could do. I started working out amd changed my diet and I got good results but again my stomach became upset...No matter what I do...I always end up failing. I am 29 yrs old and still my life moving slower than a snail..."
836,I love seeing optimism in this sub,"Whether it be little things someone’s looking forward to or just someone explaining how they’re hopeful in any way, it really inspires me. Makes me feel like there’s hope that, even with depression, I can still be okay."
837,I’m a ghost,"I wake up, go to work for 8 hours, drive home, play video games for another 5 hours, or maybe spend some time studying, and then go to bed. On the weekends I stay home and do nothing all day. All my friends are better friends with each other than with me - I’m on the periphery. I’m never really invited to hang out with them, a few years ago they even all went on a trip together and didn’t invite me because they wanted to keep the trip small. 8 of them went, nobody told me and I found out they were hanging out in Canada together over Snapchat story. I kept being friends with them because I have no other friends to even talk to. Whenever I invite them over to mine, or ask them to play video games, nobody wants to. They fucking hate me. 

I’m trying to study for an exam that I have for work that’s coming in a week or two and I can’t do it. I can’t retain any information, I can study for hours and not remember any of what I studied the next day. I’m going to fail this exam for the second time because of how stupid I am. I don’t know what to do. I’m going to get fired from my job because I can’t remember the simplest fucking things day to day. When I talk to my co workers it’s like my brain is slower than them by seconds. I’m wasting away my 20’s in a dead end job and there is nothing I can do about it.

I’m a ghost wasting away. I wish I could give the rest of my life to someone actually influential so they can continue to do good in the world, instead of me being a waste of space."
838,Does anyone here love rebels?,"People who do what they want without letting other people control everything they do? Hell, I feel like I shouldn't wear my natural hair because others might be offended by my blackness so I don't like going out but I still love other women wearing their curls out without worrying. I also love southpark but still.... I love seeing people be them and not give a shit about what others think. Took me a while to just be me and I still feel guilty about it"
839,am i depressed or facing withdrawals?,"I’m 20 years old in my 2nd year of college, i’m majoring in psychology and minoring in legal studies. I just got on deans list this marking period so i’m doing pretty decent in school. I have a girlfriend, i love her to death. But i’m never happy, unless i’m smoking weed. I can’t even do my homework or function without smoking weed. Life sucks without smoking weed. I’m on day 8 of no-fap and it’s gotten a little bit better but overall i’m really unmotivated, lazy, and sad when i’m not smoking. How can i fix myself!!!! please give me suggestions and comments!"
840,Depression is having a bad day that never ends,"It’s having a bad day everyday for no reason other than the fact that your brain doesn’t want to feel something different. Some bad days are worse than others, but at the end of the day it’s still a bad day."
841,How to cope with my absent mother?,"I just turned 18 like in November. For backstory: When I was 12 my father passed away leaving me and my 4 older sisters and my mom. My mom hasnt been the same since. I love her so much but she has never been there for me. Even after 7 years, I know it's hard death is hard she blames everything on the fact that hes dead. All my sisters are moved out and they dont understand. They keep telling me theyve dealt with all of this and i just have to get over it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after my short stay at the hospital in 2018 after years of begging to get help. I havent gotten help since despite the fact that I do have depression. My mom makes excuses for herself, pushes things off to the last minute and hasnt gotten a job. Weve moved 3 times and finally got a good apartment thanks to my boyfriend. The problem is that we receive money for social security which is our ""big check"" that pays the rent and my mom says that were going to lose it in may when I graduate. So I have to get a job, and I've been trying to get a job. I've had a job before and my anxiety and depression made it a living hell. It's so hard to get one and I basically have to support and pay for everything when the money is gone. My mom will push it off to the Last minute and we will be evicted. I cant just magically move out either. We live in a more expensive state and I'm just stuck completely. I cant ask my sisters for advice cuz all they're gonna say is ""Get a job then"" ""why dont you just make mom get a job."" Everyday Is a legitimate struggle and i cant even talk to my boyfriend about this because he doesnt understand even though he tries. I dont want to stress him out. I hope this isnt a super first world problem I dont like coming on the internet to complain often because I know other people have it worse. Any advice would be appreciated. [We do have insurance but it's very bad right now and we need to get it fixed. I have severe Phone anxiety and I dont know what to say in the first place to even do these things. Theres alot more stuff but I can explain it if you guys have any questions. Sorry if this isnt the right subreddit or whatever I dont post often.]"
842,Well today’s my birthday,"Didn’t even get out of bed or eat yet and it’s 5:45pm. I just don’t care anymore I guess. My parents wanted to do something, but I’m just not even mentally there with it today. I told them tomorrow I’ll come out that way. At 37 I just don’t care. Honestly I’m starting to care less about everything after the last 2 years. Fuck my life."
843,Does this count as depression?,"Around 3 weeks ago (I am at university) My (F,24) Mother and Sister at home found letters from my girlfriend (F,25) of 2 years (I think that's how they found out about it), my Mum than rang me about it and asked me if I was gay (I am Indian also)...she was very shocked and patronising 'you are my perfect daughter, I don't want you to ever change'. I flat out denied that I was gay and said don't be ridiculous. Ever since then I've been so upset...scared to go home Christmas... lack of sleep, upset because my sister hasn't been supportive and lack of appetite. I've let this consume me so much that I haven't even told my girlfriend. I can't stop thinking about how sad it is that my Mother the most important person to me cannot love me for being gay and I can't stop thinking about how sad it is I have to lie and pretend and the more i like the more my heart sinks that I can't be my true self to the people I love the most."
844,Idk what to write.,"My life is fucking useless. I’m just a small piece of shit in this universe. Nothing more. 
Here is a short “poem” (idek if it is a poem though) by me: “My grades fucking suck, I’m ugly as fuck.” - Me (2019). I don’t really know why I wrote this.
I’m so tired of my stupid life. I just worry about shit, overthink everything and hurt myself and people around me. I don’t have any friends that would care about me if I killed myself... I’m not going to though, I’m too much of a coward, haha."
845,Graduating a semester early!,"This year was by far the worst I’ve done academically and quite possibly the most depressing. I failed my AP class and ended the semester with a 2.4 GPA which is going to hurt my overall 3.3 GPA. I’ve been through hell and back throughout high school and was barely holding on. Before the school year started, I stopped taking my antidepressants and in November I stopped seeing my therapist for financial reasons. I plan to go to community college and study to be a recovery specialist for addicts. I wish I could say I feel proud of myself to be able to finish high school a semester early but I truly feel nothing... Maybe it still hasn’t hit me really but high school was really the worst years of my life. I started off the year with friends and wanting to finish high school with high expectations but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. People would always tell me,”After high school things will get better.” I’m very optimistic on that, but wish I didn’t have to wait til after high school yk? I never live with regrets but I feel like the past 3 years and a half felt like nothing. As if I was just barely surviving every single day."
846,Does it ACTUALLY get better?,"I always hear people saying “it gets better, things get better” but does it actually? If so, HOW??? I can’t even function and I cannot picture myself functioning or being anywhere near successful with this illness."
847,Sometimes I feel like I’ll never be truly happy.,"I (F17) have been struggling with depression ever since I can remember. I had suicidal thoughts when I was 11, and I’ve attempted suicide various times. 

I have pretty much everything a teenager would need; I’ve got lots of friends, an amazing boyfriend of two years, a family that cares about me. But I still don’t feel truly happy. 

Two years ago I started using alcohol and vaping as a coping mechanism since when I’m drunk I feel really happy and when I get stressed out the vape calms me down. 

I know I’m ruining my life, but sometimes it’s too hard to imagine myself being happy. I’m on medication and I go with my therapist regularly, but after months of that I still don’t feel better (considering that two weeks ago I was planning on killing myself). 

I don’t know. I wish I was able to be truly happy, or at least imagine myself happy in the future. 

Any advice?"
848,I'm not sure.,"Hey,

 I've always been a very positive person. I won the positivity award in highschool all 4 years, generally an upbeat person and, always took things with a type B personality. I started teaching after getting my bachelors and I've been deteriorating. I've been having physical symptoms of anxiety and stress such as migraines, 4 days a week, weekly hives that break out on the way to work and, vomitting. Honestly, the thing that made me realize that this is not a fleeting feeling is that I feel like I'm just floating through my day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm blessed to have good people in my life but I don't know how to last the next 18 weeks of my job.  I just needed to tell someone. Thanks for being an ear."
849,Just ignore this.,"I don't even feel human. I feel subhuman to my peers and I don't know what to do. Like, I have friends and I try really hard to always be there for them. However, they aren't even there for me.

I feel so mentally drained right now because earlier I was super hyper and I felt fine. From what I've learned, people like to see this side of me and yet it takes so much energy to show it sometimes; especially when the other person tries to tear me down due to my happiness. Even with that, I still try to be the joyous person that others see me as that I neglect my own depression and other feelings just to make others like me. But in the end, guess what? They don't even care about how I'm trying my hardest to be happy in order to make them a little bit more happy. I'm just some smart kid who is motivated to them I guess. I'm nothing more, and nothing less.

Over the last few months my depression I think has gotten worse. I can't focus at all and I don't feel like I'm here. I feel like I'm in a dream or something. And yet I feel the need to help others....especially my friends. I just want to be the person who finally listens to all of their problems and such... and sometimes that's their only use for me. However, when I start to talk about what happened to me and how I feel they just ignore me. I don't really talk about myself often so when someone actually does listen I start to freak out and I make them promise to ignore everything I said. I do this because I don't want to be a burden and been seen as the ""depressed/abused"" kid. But I'm just so tired of not being fully heard that I don't know what to do. 

It's probably just stupid. I probably am complaining too much or am just looking for attention. I don't know, but just ignore this."
850,I am so sad and tired.,"Hey everyone. 

I'm writing this to strangers on the Internet, because I feel like nobody in my life understands me, except me, but a huge part of me doesn't seem to care about me enough to implement some things and move on from many traumas finally, or at least make an effort not to slowly continue myself.

I went through some horrible shit in my early childhood and I didn't realise understand what happened. 

I started self-harming since 11 years old and since then I do it and I'm 25 now. Not everyday, there were huge chunks of time I didn't self harm, at least no physically. 

I've tried to kill myself when I was 15 first, then when I 22, then again this year. 

I've been in 6 relationships which I consider a lot considering my age, and it caused me a lot of pain, trauma and heartbreak. 

I kept falling foolishly for people who presented themselves as everything I wanted, but most importantly needed and so I realised year or two later, after so much arguing and blaming myself, they were actually pretty abusive and they  made a sane person (probably more people than just me) to behave in innapropriate ways, I literally let them walk all over me because that's how I had to act as a child. 

I've been through numerous psychologists and psychiatrists, been diagnosed with a lots of labels, but generally speaking I don't believe in labels, I believe in symptoms. 

This is how I feel both emotionally/physically/mentally and spiritually on a daily basis for quite a long time now  (I'll get to that later)

Chronic pain in my body wakes me up before I got enough sleep, if I even manage to get more than 6 hours I still don't feel rested because I have weird scary nightmares or just very uncomfortable dreams that I forget as soon as I wake up. 

I have in the past tried to cut off my left arm and that hurts both physically and emotionally to this day. 

That's why I'm addicted to painkillers as well. 

I get agitated almost every morning because of that. I am angry first thing in the morning, before I drink benzos and have 2,3 cups of coffee and smoke and listen to music or watch Youtube. I am unemployed for 3 months now and I feel like a failure. Even being a waiter caused me to break down, amongst other factors.

I lost hope in people and the world around me, there is some left for myself, but when I really think about it, if I expose myself to the world they will kill that hope, and its small anyway. 

I don't know who I am, I feel like I'm living in constant cognitive dissonance, I constantly question myself and everyone and everything around me until I get so restless, panic and lose interest in pursuing anything or anyone and just want to disappear.

I am very paranoid about people and the world in general. It drives me crazy to think about the possibility of someone tracking my phone or ip address, or what I do and where i go and how often. I don't like feeling manipulated or controlled but I am, because I am a part of this system whether I like it or not. 

I have aspirations for myself, but I don't have motivation to pursue them. 

I often criticize and verbally abuse myself and others, people tell I am very negative (mostly my family) and it pisses  me off because its like they don't understand how much fucking trauma I went through, how can I stay positive, I really don't know, all those positive and motivational quotes and stuff seems so unrelatable and untrue to me. 

I have a reason for acting this way and being this angry but it gets me more angry that people who should understand that, don't and instead make my state worse by telling me these hurtful, untrue things that only deepen my self-hate and hate towards them and the psychiatrict system and the world in general. 

I am unable to connect to people. I am very nervous in social situations, I have paranoid, obsessive thoughts that make me very anxious, my hands are always shaking, I hate how when some people notice that they ignore me and don't want to have anything to do with me. 

Each and every guy I've been in a relationship with, I 'm sure he only wanted me first because of my looks and second because he didn't really listen to me so he didn't understand that I'm not the type of person he is attracted to, they were attracted to their own ideas of me and when I was honest and upfront, they really didn't listen and then later blamed me for having issues and actually made them worse. 

My friends do not call me or message me anymore, they have given up on me. They are tired of hearing depressing &amp; suicidal thoughts and they don't take me seriously because I talk about it a lot, but only rarely try to go through with it. 

I feel misunderstood, rejected, unworthy of true love for my soul, not my looks, unheard and desperate. I am apathetic, I don't care about my body so now I got myself in a bad state, I'm anorexic, all my ribs showing, all my bones sticking out, I have no energy, mental, emotional or physical.

My hair is falling out, I'm addicted to Benzos and I abuse drugs because those are the only moments where I feel happy, relaxed, talkative, excited or any other positive emotion. 

When someone tries to get close to me or I feel intimacy I want to cry but I don't want to show them my tears so I get angry instead or just dissociate completely. 

I have many flashbacks and certain words, energy, smells and people, situations that make me very angry, mistrustful and I just want to leave asap, but then I come home to be critized for not doing enough to help myself, for looking like a skeleton, for dressing up a certain way, I've lost all will to try to engage in any kind of relationship. 

When I look at myself in the mirror I feel so sad for that little girl that has lost her innocence and childhood to selfish people. 

I cry and weep everyday for her, I loved her spirit so much. I feel broken. I think I'm slowly killing myself, so when I do overdose or something people won't say I did it to myself because it wasn't as noticeable as a quick suicide. 

I don't know what else to write, I'm so tired and I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. 

I think only then will people around me partially understand their fault and how much I was in pain. But I don't think they will feel guilt, they deny having to do anything with it. 

Anyway, I'm gonna go now, thanks for reading."
851,I only want to be genuinely happy.,
853,I swear I was so happy that shorter days have arrived because of winter. But they’re not short enough.,You know you’re depressed when you’re falling asleep by 6:30
854,Birthdays are the worst,I used to get so excited for my birthday but now I just feel this dread lol. It’s just a brutal reminder of how unsuccessful and unaccomplished I am. It’s like I’m running out of time because I’m getting older and I feel like I’ve wasted all these years because of depression. There doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of my tunnel
855,Anyone else feel lonely all the time?,"Im a high schooler and I recently moved and left all my close friends behind. I've been in this new school for a full semester now and it feels like I have no actual friends. I'm well liked among everyone I know and most people in my class like me. I make jokes and do dumb stuff in class while maintaining a good grade so most of the teachers like me too. But I just feel so lonely outside of school. I don't have anyone close enough to ask to hang out with so every weekend/break I just sit at home and do nothing. When I'm home everything seems pointless and I feel like dying. I would never kill myself, but I feel like life would be so much easier if I didn't focus on social interactions so much and just sat down forever until I died. And I LIKE social interactions. I just don't get any because I have no real friends anymore. It absolutely kills me but it happens only sometimes when I'm alone. Just knowing nobody really cares. I don't know if this is depression or not, but I just want to talk to somebody about it."
856,School,"*Kinda a rant*

My parents think my grades are dropping because the classes I'm taking are hard, which they are but it's not just that.

Having depression and soical anxiety hold me back and make my work ethic less.
They dont realize how much I'm struggling.

They think I just spend time on my phone all the time and dont actually try or put in effort.
When in reality I do try and I push my self way past how much I can handle."
857,Making friends as an adult sucks,"So context. I am a 29 year old guy who recently moved to the midwest from the east coast for a new job. I started about a month ago. I have gotten settled into my new appartment, new job, and overall daily routine pretty well and i like my new job alot. Now I am at the point where I want to meet new people and make new friends, becuase I dont have any here...and i do not want to go crazy by myself in the already freezing cold winter. Today at work, the association I am a part of was having an after work get together, filled with snacks and the like. I figured this would be the perfect oppurtunity to meet some like-minded people. I get to the room, and it is pretty packed. The line to get food is maybe 80 people deep. So i hop in line and hopeni can spark a concersation with people in the line...and oh boy that was a mistake. There are two women standing in front of me having a pretty in depth conversayion that I feel like i cannot but into so Indont...so I stand and wait. it is a good foce minutes and I have been the last person standing in line the whole time, and the line has not moved for the food. Then, finally, a group of about 4 or so people get behind me. they seem about my age and they are laughing and such and figured...hey maybe these people would be good to talk too. But i dont. insread I stand there with shifty eyes, trying to find something to look at, and i can feel like i and getting glares. and i see all these people arpund me, already with groups of friends hugging and talking...and I am justvstanding there by myself. there was a guy who was gping thrpugh the line talking to people and shaking people's hands...and hr walkedbright past me. at that moment I said...fuck it....and left.all in all i stood in line for 25 minutes. i left the room, no new friends and nonfood, in a fit of sadness in rage that I am almost 30 and I cannot talk to people in my own field without habing people look at me lile I am cracked out of my mind. now i am standing in the cold waiting for the bus, wanting to cry but cant because I am surrpunded by strangers and...again....its winter in the midwest....

tldr: im new to an area trying to make friends. i went to an afterwork event to meet people amd eat snavks but panicked and upset so i made no friends and ate no food."
858,Nobody will even notice when i kill myself,I don't know what I did to deserve this lot in life but my 20 fucking years on this plane have proven to me time and time again that I am absolutely unlovable and unlikable and doomed to be outcast and stepped on by all people. I am a worthless piece of shit. The sooner I can accept that the better. I wish I knew what was wrong with me I wish I knew what chip was missing. I just can't do it anymore r/depression I'm so sick of being alive I don't know if I won't kill myself why am I so fucking horrible
859,I’m realizing how lost I actually am,"I have been quite fine for the last few years. I’ve met this amazing person I now live with, I had great friends who I considered family. Work was going well. I think I was the closest to happy I had ever been. 

Since this summer things changed quite a bit. It started when my brother, who was also my best friend, died in an accident. It was very sudden and it hit me quite hard. My best friends and my girlfriend reacted by, the first few days, feeling sorry for me and trying to support me. But at that time I just wanted to be left alone, and they kind of blamed me for it. I had the feeling that as soon as I wasn’t the fun, happy guy they were used to anymore, they wouldn’t give a shit. 

After that I moved to another city with my girlfriend. My friends stopped talking to me. 

At first I enjoyed changing sceneries, moving in with her, and we soon made lots of new friends. 
But a few months passed now, and I just feel like the whole thing is a huge mascarade. I’m always surrounded by people, but whenever I’m alone, on the subway or walking back home, I just start crying. I am alone. 

I love my gf, but I dont know what’s left anymore. We barely talk to each other and she never opens up whenever I try to. I find myself delaying my return home after work... I don’t know what to do, I don’t even know if I still love her or just the idea of her. I feel trapped.
I feel guilty because of the commitments we made, I feel like I failed her and everyone else. 
I’m aware the relationship is getting toxic, and a part of me wants it all to go back to the way it was. Another part of me just wants to leave. How can I want to be alone but be so afraid of being lonely at the same time ? 

Sorry for the long post"
860,I need a hug,"Idk if this is that serious. Well, I don't know if you can call it panic attack but last last day, I was staring at the sky for hours, I'm not thinking about negative thoughts, though, just weird and random things that a normal person wouldn't think about. Then, suddenly, I felt an intense pain in my chest area, I couldn't breathe properly, my whole bofy felt numb especially my face, I was trembling so hard, I cried without a reason, it lasted for almost 10 minutes. I fell down on the floor and fainted, I was out for 30 mins. I thought I was gonna die, IDK, but, when I woke up and realized that I'm still alive, I felt so disappointed. I wanted it to happen again and, fortunately, it did happen yesterday and today. It was way worse today, coz I wanted to cut my arm after it happened, but I promised myself not to until next month, I might break my promise tho and do it later, I'll make it so deep but I hope my family won't notice. Any good ideas how to hide it?"
861,Too difficult to work,"I started a new job as a preschool teacher and the long hours and not enough manpower is slowly killing me. I wake up early each day and I feel this wave of anxiety and depression all over me. It’s gotten so bad that I just took two days sick leave even though I’m not sick and am just convincing myself and the entire world that I am. I feel like a fraud. Working with kids even though I don’t have the energy to make anything fun or engaging enough, and the school keeps accepting more and more children even though we severely lack in teachers. I’m so tired and done and I don’t know how people can ever survive work while being depressed and this makes me feel like a loser who can’t do anything right and have no productivity."
862,How do I know if I'm depressed,I tried to kill myself at a party today by holding my breath but it ofc didn't work. Things haven't been great lately. I do t really know what life is for
863,"Depression doesn't ruin your life, it can't. It simply messes up your perspective on life, and then you ruin it yourself.","Depression doesn't ruin your life, it can't. It simply messes up your perspective on life, and then you ruin it yourself. With your own two hands. At least that's what is happening to me. At this point, sometimes I wonder why I don't just give up. But I can't lie, it makes me feel a little bit better to know that i am so resilient i put up with this for 20 years, ever since i was a kid. I just wish there was some kind of hope, but i don't think there is. I just think i am meant to be miserable. Or maybe this is just that messed up perspective on life i was talking about. Who knows."
864,Friendly reminder: take your antidepresdants WITH FOOD!,"Holy shit you guys

This is like one of those things. Like when you get sick you just regret not appreciating all the times you were healthy. This is the I wish I'd appreciate being able to breath through both nostrils of antidepressants.

Today I got up pretty early, but left my bed VERY late. Some of you can probably relate, when I got up it was 12PM *ding ding ding* med time. Now my meds _technically_ have to be eaten with food, as to nit upset ur stomach. Ive even eaten them without food before and I KNOW hoe much it sucks. Yet for aome reason I was inpatient bc I didn't want to eat yet, and just ate the meds with some water.

*oh boi*

Such a mistake. Big big mistake. Holy _fucking shit_ what a mistake. Ive had the worst acid teflux if MY LIFE today. For the sake of comparison, it's 12 AM right now. That means ive been sugfering for TWELVE FUCKING HOURS. Ive been vompletrly fucking useless all day, and i probabo wint be ablr to sleep bc the acid reflux is SO bad I keep throwing up.

So just a reminder to not do what I did. Learn from my mistake people. Even if ur not hungry fucking _eat_ pls"
865,New therapist,"I miss my old therapist. We really came to an understanding and we could even laugh about my drama sometimes. I was so thankful, she really saved my life as I could share anything at any time (via mail). I even wrote her a card. Thanking her for all the changes she had helped me with. (With a terrible poem, which at that point I had the self esteem to share).

I had seen her for around 8 months. She suggested specialized treatment after 2 months. She was still in training for it, so I needed another agency to break my patterns of extreme adaptation, dependence and feeling like a failure. And my dependence on her as a therapist was feeling pathetic. I was failing at what I needed to achieve, so I was proud I could let go (I think). 

I have a new therapist for whom I have waited 6 months. I told him I am desperate for selfcompassion. I want to be able to forgive myself. How I tried so much. Therapy, books, talks in the mirror, notes in my house, doing stuff by myself, opening up to others. He tells me I have affect phobia and I am emotionally immature. I don't want to feel things and avoid emotions. I denied this openly, but he insists. I need to change and he must know something after rigorous testing, so I accept as I need to get rid of some of these symptoms. 

Before last session I filled in a questionnaire in which I told how much my suicidal thoughts were impairing and paralyzing me. How I cried every day. How lonely I am. Yet he didn't talk about any of that. He only told me about my phobia and how I avoid pain. I tried to accept this view and we argued a bit, I did recognize some patterns, but in the end he didn't get my name right, which felt awful. I waited so long for this specialized treatment and I want to give it a chance, but I feel so much worse. I wanted to share this with the few people I have left, but I want to stop burdening others as I want to be emotionally mature.

I actually can't believe these stigmas are internalized so quickly. I'm so weak and feel like I don't have my own identity. I always thought I was more in touch with my emotions than the avarage person. I am overly sensitive and empathetic. I always fought my own battles and could handle emotions just fine until my latest depression kicked in. 

The last couple of weeks have been filled with fantasizing about my death. How selfish it would be, but it seems so libarating. Today at work I had figured it all out. Then a friend texted me after a few months of silence. 'How are you?'. I honestly said ""I was worried for me"". I had stopped looking for help when I needed it. I was done being weak. But to have someone to listen mattered enough to get me through the night. She might have saved my life. But I still doubt it. I feel like a coward with a fantasy. I really want to stop existing, but everytime I end up looking for attention or just sitting out the feeling. And I hate it. I hate myself for it. This time the attention helped me again. I am so exhausted by this fight and am done exhausting others. 

I would share this with my therapist and my old one would tell me that it's dangerous to fight alone, but I am done. I don't feel I have the time to share this with my new therapist, since he is so caught up in my emotional immaturity and my affect phobia. 

I told my general physician about my complaints since I was worried I might have some shortages physically (vegan). Turns out my depression is affecting my body with aches and exhaustion. She suggested meds, but my therapist told me that it wouldn't be a good idea. I told my physician this and my troubles with therapy, but I wasn't ready to change therapists. I am not doing meds for now, since it scares me. Last time I was so numb and I don't want to go there again. Yet I am worried. I am considering telling my physician I need another treatment, but I feel like I should try more than the 3 sessions I've had with him. I just don't know. All I know is I need to feel better soon if I want to keep what little I have left in my life."
866,*sigh*,"why do i even try to anymore. All i do is hide these feelings behind that funny smile and laugh. Everyone sees me as the happy one in the friend group, but the second i get home I light a ciggeret and try to cope. Life is nothing but a downhill slope."
867,No hope anymore,I genuinely would not kill myself. I’ll just start with that. I have 0 hope left for my future. My grades are okay. I have a 3.2 grade average and I’ve maintained that through these past few years of high school (I’m a junior) but that’s not good enough for any scholarships or any schools I want to go to. My depression has taken over my life and has made school impossible. I need help figuring out what to do about school and finding any kind of motivation overall. I feel like there’s no point in trying anymore because I already don’t have a shot at anything good. Any tips on dealing with depression/being unmotivated?
868,I think drugs actually help me,"I drink a lot of alcohol because when I am dunk, I can be happy and forget all the bad things in my life (also I smoke weed sometimes). 
The only reason how I survive the week is because I know, I can drink alcohol in the weekend. I feel like without it I would be even more depressed.
Its not like i am happy when I drink, often I just rage and i am aggressive and sometimes I am even more depressed then before, but it kinda gives me hope, when I realize that being sad is not the only emotion I feel."
869,Unlikeable,"I dont really want to live because I feel like if anyone really knew me properly, they wouldn't like me. I dont even know who I am but I just feel detestable and disgusting? Dont really know how to fix this. Dont want to tell anyone this because I dont want them to think I'm like draining or annoying 🤔"
870,failing again,just flunked out of school a second time (every class) and i owe a bit of money now. i feel like i ruined every possible chance of having a decent life
871,Hi i am new to this sub and need some advice on where to start?,"I am a 20 year old male and i feel like i am stuck and do not even know where to begin to start. I don't really like to self diagnose, but i feel that i need to make an appointment to see what is  going on. i have been happy, sad, angry, and frustrated everyday for the past 2 years even though it feels like it has been an eternity. I have finally told my parents that i should probably get help because i can feel it getting worse, so i called to see if my primary care doctor had any available appointments and his closest one is the end of February. What would you recommend someone to do when they don't know where to start? i see quite a few behavior health doctors near me most are not accepting patients, but i am afraid that i am going to pick the wrong doctor. anyways thank you for reading and any help would be greatly appreciated"
874,Struggles,"I've been struggling lately, for a while actually.

A year ago I starting get help for my depression. I went to my doctor and started taking some antidepressants. Almost immediately I started having problems.

The first meds I were put on I reacted horribly too. Nausea and commiting, splitting migraines and manic episodes, almost every day. 

I changed meds and while it was better I was still having issues at least once a week. I started to feel a little bit better.

I started seeing a therapist and I felt like iw as getting better.

Then We uncovered a second issue, anxiety. Some days it felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. Other days I was trembling and jittery for hours.

Then my FMLA ran out and I had a new problem. I was still having side effects from my meds. But I couldn't miss anymore work. I told my doctor I needed help. She said no, she wouldn't renew my FMLA. I tired to carry on but in the end I stopped taking my meds. 

My depression came back, but now with the added anxiety. It was bad, REALLY bad. My doctor gave me an anti anxiety medication and that helped a little. But I was still struggling.

I burned through my PTO and couldn't see my doctor anymore as she does not work on the days I have off. 

I have a new doctor now and am praying the FMLA paperwork I've given her will be approved.

It seems like every other day is a struggle. I have no desire to go to work or do any of the things that used to interest me. Some days I wake up and can barely think of a reason to get out of bed. Other days it's like everything is fine. Or I'll be having a good day and one tiny thing will ruin everything.

I feel like I'm falling apart. Like I'm out of control.

I barely care about anything anymore.
I'm about ready to say ""fuck it"" and stop taking my meds all together so I just go back to being depressed. At least then I was 'functional'. I was just miserable then.

Its better than this.

Better then being broken like this.

It's better to be miserable than this rollercoaster of depression, anxiety, worry and uncertainty that I'm on.

I don't know why I'm writing this. maybe I just need to vent."
875,Is this what life is? Not knowing what you want?,"I never seem to really know what I want, I want to  have people close to me then I feel like I want to be alone. I hardly have any friends and feel like I just push people away as I try to understand how social situations work but fail. Last night was different. I felt the urge to do it again. It felt so real like I had to finish things and I felt happy for a change that it will all be over and I wouldn't need to worry about how I'm perceived anymore worrying if I made a mistake or mispome during a conversation but then I realised I can't I couldn't just selfishly just hurt my wife by leaving her like this and feel like I'd let another person down. Is this what life is? It feels like I'm always trapped in a cage that is my humanity."
876,Please tell me what to do,"My mother is a good woman but she called me a junkie for coming home at 5 am one time since like a year or so. I had ""cry attacks"" and felt like shit for three days. Today I carved ""junkie"" into my arm as to not forget who she thinks I am, then i made a deep cut which got stitched in the er, thankfully. I also destroyed my PC and monitor and a bunch of other stuff in my room. I guess they got scared or something and called the police, who called the ambulance. Worst part is they do not want me back at home and the mental hospital doesnt want me because I acted calm and all in the ER. So in the morning I will be on the streets. I'm thinking about throwing myself under a car riding on the road when I get out.  It is 11:50 pm right now here.

WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?  This is a real question."
877,I am so tired of being alone and disgusted with myself.,"I have no friends, I always talk with my mind, I hate my parents for giving me life as I am, I'm always alone in my ""world"", I'm afraid to go out because I'm disgusted with myself. The medicines are worsening everything because I am completely annihilated without any emotion or feeling. Most likely I'll end up being homeless.

Why am I still alive? The medicines and the therapy do not work, 4 years have passed in this way... I am tired of living like this, I wish that everything could end tomorrow.

I'm writing this here because I'm dying to find help, but I already know no one here can help me. No one can help me, anywhere."
878,Am I suicidal?,"I want to die but I don’t want to kill myself.

I just don’t want to be around anymore. I everything is so hard, it never seems to get any better. I ruin every opportunity I have to be happy. I constantly just push people away and make them hate me.

But I love my family, especially my mom. I could never do anything to myself that would make her upset. She’s pretty much all I have in this world. So I could never take my own life.

But I also can’t stand being alive anymore because there never seems to be any way out for me."
879,"My family failed to raise my correctly, now I got to pick up the pieces myself.","If anybody plans on being parents ever, make sure it wasn’t on impulse, give your child a healthy amount of technology use, be aware of psychology, and don’t be a dumbass. You’re literally bringing a life into this world that didn’t choose to come here, so don’t fuck up their life by not being a parent."
880,any tips to get over a self-harm addiction???,"i recently relapsed and recently i’ve been thinking of self harming more than i usually did, i really hate it and just really needed a way to get over my addiction"
881,Does this count as depression?,"Around 3 weeks ago (I am at university) My (F,24) Mother and Sister at home found letters from my girlfriend (F,25) of 2 years (I think that's how they found out about it), my Mum than rang me about it and asked me if I was gay (I am Indian also)...she was very shocked and patronising 'you are my perfect daughter, I don't want you to ever change'. I flat out denied that I was gay and said don't be ridiculous. Ever since then I've been so upset...scared to go home Christmas... lack of sleep, upset because my sister hasn't been supportive and lack of appetite. I've let this consume me so much that I haven't even told my girlfriend. 

I have always found it difficult to accept my sexuality, in fact not many people who are close to me know. But now, on top of that I can't stop thinking about how sad it is that my Mother the most important person to me cannot love me for being gay and I can't stop thinking about how sad it is I have to lie and pretend and the more i like the more my heart sinks that I can't be my true self to the people I love the most."
882,I just need to hear that i am not cursed to always be not enough,
883,Pointless,"What am I even good for?  My friend was one-upping me in conversation today and I realized I'm not good at anything.  I'm just here.  Getting an education for no reason because I'm not gonna do anything important when I grow up.  Living for no reason because I'm not gonna make any impact on anything.  And now I want to kill myself because I feel so unimportant.  I am unimportant.  In the end, I am just one in a few billion, so does it even matter if I'm gone?

I'm especially sad because I thought I had just figured everything out.  I'd been depressed for 10 years and I just started feeling like my life mattered a month ago.  But if I'm just gonna keep falling back to depression, what is even the point?  At least before I had happiness to look forward to.  Now that I know it's not sustainable, I don't think I want to do this anymore.  The happiness was fun while it lasted, but I think it's time I go.  I'm just a waste of space."
884,"I know I don’t have it worse, you don’t need to fucking remind me.","I was venting on text (I haven’t vented to her in 3 months aha -_-) 
She said:
“Stop acting u have it worse. People have it worser than you.”
WELL NO SHIT I KNOW THAT."
885,Just wished I died,I tried to kill myself for the 2nd time and I got sent to the ER and the psych ward. Turns out that sends a hell of a bill to my parents and my dad is just yelling at me about the costs and how stupid I am. God I wish I just died that would've just cost less.
886,For those of you who are 30+. Do you have given up and stopped being a tryhard?,Next year I'll be 30 and tbh I feel like my tryhard phase is slowly coming to an end. I'm about to give up on life and at the verge of breaking down.
887,I'm losing interest in my friends,"I don't know if this is depression related or not but I don't know if I like my own friends anymore, I just don't find them entertaining to be around. Idk"
888,Is it just me or has 2019 been the worst year ever,I thought I couldn’t get any lower but this year proved me wrong I totaled my car cause a semi truck pulled out in front of me I still don’t have a car because I only had liability insurance I lost my job had to drop out of school my first semester my credit score has hit 300 my best friend/ lover just left me one day and I haven’t talked to them since all of my “friends” have abandoned me since I don’t have a car or money to uber anywhere I tried to kill myself at the end of October and got bakeracted and that made me worse than I already was I have nothing and I feel so hopeless I’m ready for this year to be over
889,relapsed on my self harm addiction about a week ago,last week after some stressful events i decided to self harm in a school bathroom and skipped most of a class to do so. i would’ve been 3 months sober from self harm today if i hadn’t relapsed. i regret it so much and my hate towards my dumb decision just makes me want to self harm more. it’s just so frustrating...
890,"Survived one attempt and I still don't see a clear way out of my situation, please give me some guidance.","I don't know where to start but I thought that I might be a sociopath. About me, I was always angry at home since I was 11-12 mainly towards my parents, later on room-mates and now anyone I don't like. I am only irritable at home or in my car. In public I've been trying to be the nicest person ever.

When I was 15 my parents sent me abroad to study. I got an early acceptance for an engineering program just like I was expected by my middle-eastern parents. After that point I stopped caring about high-school and my grades reflected it. I got in trouble for skipping class too much, not waking up on time(it was a boarding school, terrible experience btw), suspended once for drinking alcohol outside school, and once for drinking inside school. Well of course my parents had a melt-down each step on the way. I never understood why they reacted the way they did since I had accomplished my one ""duty"", I was going to be an engineer. On top of all the drama they cancelled on their promise of buying me a car for next year, which I kind of convinced them into buying anyways(I hope it wasn't cruel though, what happens is if I ask enough times either mom or dad agrees and they start arguing with each other and it becomes two against one). First year university was fine, second year I choked. Instead of telling them the truth I lied and told them I wanted to change programs. After a second wave of drama they agreed to send me to an aviation school(aviation was one of my favourite hobbys). I'm not sure how, but one morning(2017) I ended up sleeping in and it felt so good I did it the next day. On the third day I felt so anxious thinking of all the questions I would get about my absence. And I wanted to keep sleeping, so I did. Second week I started skipping purely because of anxiety. At this point, flight training proved to give me motion sickness as well(I was already prone to throwing up in school busses as a kid, and I still get carsick if I can't see the road within seconds). So I made myself believe that even if I had graduated, I would have been a terrible pilot with my drawbacks. This is when I started really messing up.

First it was depression; during summer of 17' I got rejected by a girl, we hung out pretty often that summer and I tought there was a connection(there wasn't, there never was), and I can't take rejections well. Depression could be one thing that might have caused my laziness but back then it was complete tunnel vision for me. I started believing I didn't have a purpose in life, I was making everyone sad and concerned that I should end my existence. I only had to get my mind around the how to do it part. I decided to let the clock run out instead of acting on it then and there. So I dropped out, started spending my flight training money on weed, escorts and a cheap sports car which I kept driving up and down twisty roads(40kmh limit) through heavy forrests at night not slower than 140kmh, to this day I don't know how I survided it so many times(one of my street racer friends told me he couldn't do it that fast himself if he tried). I also stopped paying rent so I would have a reason to end myself when the rental company eventually contacted my parents for no payment.

Then one afternoon I got the text from my parents, I got off the bed (I was sleeping past noon of course) grabbed my keys and without showering or washing my face I started driving. I had the perfect route planned beforehand so I knew where I was going to. It was I think a Thursday around 11am. There had to be a school excursion on the parkway or something because there were pedestrians everywhere along the road which I picked. I didn't want to make a scene around so many strangers and drove away, saw a ditch by the side of the highway on my way back, I sped up, drove onto the wall that was at the end of the ditch(2-3 meters deep) I remember feeling the zero g right before my car fell in and then I woke up to smoke, a weird taste in my mouth, wipers running, some bruises. Got out of the car, sat on a rock by the side of the road. Some construction workers around saw me and came by, called emergency services etc. Apparently the car started flipping after the impact and that absorbed most of the momentum. I was fine, we went to the hospital and they told me to wait. I waited for three hours, got bored and left. Told my parents what happened, I don't know if they understood what happened. I never told my real intentions to anyone. I asked them to send me some amount of money for medical expenses, just enough to cover unpaid rents. Lied to them about rental company's call(they have limited English so I just had to say don't worry I got this). I paid three months rent. Basically reset my clock. When it was time to graduate I made up another story and now I am supposed to be on my final year. What is shitty about the whole situation is that I have no status here where I'm living at the moment. So I can't get a job and support myself next year; if I give up, I will have to go to where I was born, where I have to do mandatory military service, risk my life for a cause I don't believe in, or disappoint my parents and embarrass myself in front of relatives, not to mention I haven't been there since 2013 or since I was 15. I am 22 now. I don't talk to anyone there other than my parents. And I don't want to talk to my parents. If I say I might be a sociopath; my dad definitely one hundred percent is. I would do anything to avoid them and if we have to live together, I will gladly take an elevator to the top floor of any building and jump the fuck down.

Anyways if you read all of this thank you so much and I hope it wasn't boring, cringy, upsetting too much. I'm not sure what to do next, I have a couple plans to get out of this. If you have any advice I would love to hear it. If you want to discuss I can answer DMs.

Another story about how my previous attempt at fixing my issues went if anyone wants to read:

After the car crash, I called a suicide hotline to see my options because If I was going to be living I had to know whether my constant sadness could get fixed somehow. The operator told me to go to a hospital if I felt like doing something similar again, I never understood the fucking point of saying that. It's like a criminal turning themselves in to the police before attempting robbery. When I got hospitalized after my failed attempt I never said anything about suicide. I just dodged a wild animal on the road and lost control. So I to asked the operator about going to a therapist; she said I had to google it. -""How about walk-in clinics?"", operator:""Yeah they should know what to do."". Useless. Next day I went, told the doctor what happened, he prescribed me effexor, referred me to a specialist. Asked him about therapy options, he said I had to google it. He spent less than ten minutes in the room including writing my prescription and explaining how to take it. Even though I was skeptical I took the meds. My appointment with the specialist was in a few weeks, so I started searching for a therapist immediately. The therapist dude seemed chill but I couldn't get myself to tell him exactly what happened. We ended up talking about my childhood a little bit and I understood nothing from anything he told me. I ghosted him after the first session. I felt bad about it too he was a nice guy. A week or two later the meds kicked in, they were horrible. Now when I normally felt sad, I cried so easily, so intense and felt worse than ever before, when I normally felt happy(with friends outside), I felt intensely happy, always talking, couldn't stopped giggling, at the same time my heart was pounding with excitement for very little reasons. It was bad and I told it to the specialist, he changed up the prescription and told me to come see him again after a few weeks. I got the meds but lost the motivation to do anything and I never took them. I stopped taking effexor also and it wasn't too bad. Got worse after one month and back to normal shittyness within 2 months. Now I don't know if it's the right thing to go seek medication or therapy. I don't even have health insurance to cover the therapy costs :("
891,Manic episodes after sundown,"I start listening to rap music and running around the house doing nothing but maladaptive dreaming. 

It hurts."
892,People can be so inconsiderate...,"I really don't know what to say here. I guess I could just start with a story. Today I woke up depressed as hell (as usual) not wanting to go to school after a night of crying thinking about ways to kill myself. I did a ton of thinking with what my plan would be because I'm not lucky enough to have a place to hang myself from or have a gun to shoot myself with although I have 2 bullets, one a 9mm and the other an SPL. I went to school though, and it didn't turn out well. I joke around with a few buddies, none of which I consider friends really, having that fake ass smile and laugh. I didn't really talk about it all day because I just didn't feel like being real with anyone, but at the end of the day, in my last class, I decide to tell one of my buddies from the morning and another buddy who sits at the same table. My buddy from the morning just gives me advice on how to end it and I really appreciated it although I didn't have anything to heed his advice with. My other buddy just laughed and said I was ""emo"" which is seriously offensive to me cuz I don't try to be that kid who's sad around others, but it just happens when the emotional pain is too much. I just stayed quiet listening to some depressing music and not doing any work. When I got home I played some Minecraft to kinda forget about my day, obviously it didn't work. A few nights earlier I carved the word ""WORTHLESS"" on my upper right arm with my razor blade and ""BITCH"" on my upper left arm and last night I carved a heart next to it to kinda show a fucked up sense of positivity. I plan on carving ""LOVE"" on my left forearm and ""SUICIDE"" on my right forearm. I have to see my psychologist soon so I'll end it now. I love you all."
893,How do I help,My wife is suffering from health anxiety and depression all I want to do is help but she isolates herself and says she has ruined my life and that I would be better off without her. I just want to help make things easier so she can get through this. Any suggestions how to support her
894,I am so tired,"I feel so empty. Everything I enjoy, I just kinda enjoy. Things that I wouldnt be upset about before now make me want to jump off a building. 

Today i got my grades from this year of high school and they were ""good"". But I feel like I underperformed, those results in that piece of paper make me feel worthless, like a failure. And everything in my life feels like that right now. 

I just want to cry all the time. I used to enjoy having conversations with people and now I've cut off so many people from my life and I care, but I have this feeling like I'm just a bother to them and I hate it so I want them to be away. I hate myself so much, and I just wish I could fall asleep and never wake up again."
895,I don't know,How do I get out of this cycle. I feel worthless so I don't do shit that needs done so in turn prove I'm worthless. I hate who I am but it seems like I always continue to be the same shitty person. I want to change but I can't make myself.
896,Point in living?," I was just thinking I'm not worth anything. Why am I even alive? I can't fucking do anything right. I go to away to school and I can't do it because of social anxiety. I fail 2 classes at a local community college this semester because of anxiety and not knowing what to do. I don't speak to anyone anywhere because everyone thinks I'm weird from social anxiety. I’ll talk to someone and the conversation just dies and everything becomes silent. I'm never going to have children or get married or have a gf because who tf would want to be with me who has a shit ton of mental issues (Anxiety, Depression, Derealization, Tourette’s). I only have one true friend who doesn’t think I’m weird and we’re in the same boat. 

I don't get any enjoyment out of anything anymore since I stopped smoking weed (psychiatrist is drug testing)and I'm not good at anything. And becuz I'm not smart I'm gonna work a dead end job and become nothing but a lonely vegetable. What's the point in being alive?"
897,They’ve failed us.,"Why should I continue being miserable? Nothing else matters. Nobody is there. I keep waiting. I want to order some kind of drug. Something that will put me to sleep so I’ll never wake up. I keep searching. I want to take it and fall asleep. I don’t want to wake up. I hope I never wake up. I don’t want to feel pain or heartache ever again. I don’t want to have to go through every day dreading every moment. 

Nobody else matters. If they cared, they should have been there. Nobody ever is. I’m suffering. I wish someone could see and help. I wish it was that easy. I just get ignored. The only thing I can say is nobody really cares about me. I have no friends. I have barely anyone.

Nothing is changing. It never gets better. I just pin all my hopes on something. And that gets me by until those hopes are shattered again and I am even worse. I just keep getting worse.

Why is it so hard for me? Why do I have to suffer? Why couldn’t I just be happy or at least as happy as everyone else. At least enough to have friends. Why did I have to be this way?"
898,Does anyone just watch Netflix all day?,I seriously have no direction in life and going with the flow. It’s bad. But find no motivation anymore
899,Idk how to deal with the encouragement of my friend,"Hey there!

I've been on an all time low for months and it hasn't helped that my (pretty &amp; thin) friend has had a thing with a guy who rejected me and friendzoned him anyway in the end and all. I've been thinking of myself quite low, I was getting my hopes up a few times at university with guys but it all fired backwards and I really get it though, I'm just not the girl you can desire easily or think of in a sexual way...

However that's not what this is about. Regarding that issue she's trying really hard to be helpful by telling me not to say bad things about myself and to change my attitude and try harder and fake it til I make it but I really have a strong aversion against all of that and coming from her I can't really take it seriously, too, I just get really angry because she really has no idea what it's like for me and that I really can't and of some aspects believe I shouldn't change that way. I am working on the putting myself down part, but if I feel a certain way that's just how I feel and I can voice that or just not talk about how I feel at all.

Sometimes when I tell her and she tries to give me advice and I don't think it would help to follow it she gets really upset that she's putting in energy and being my therapist and I'm not even taking her advice. I didn't even ask her, when she wants to know what I am struggling with I tell her but she didn't have to say anything and that is never something I'd expect, just because I'm not seeing my therapist atm.

I think she very much reduces me to my problem and it gets really hard to be around her because she nags at everything I say and I don't really feel like saying anything anymore because her telling me to be more positive is what gets me down for some reason now.

Idk does anybody else feel like this with a friend? I really don't want this to break apart but she is so patronizing and it really gets me down."
901,I thought things were getting better,I've never tried so hard in life to improve but it always seems the damage has been done. I don't feel close to anyone and whenever I do I mess it all up.  I don't want to be living this house but at least I have a place to stay. I've had my face in my pillow all day and hope to continue that through the night. I have no energy for this anymore. All I feel I can do is sleep to pass the time.

904,Just got turned down,"Really sucks, idk how I can continue this way, anyone know any ways to get over a girl"
905,Here’s hoping that some new doors will open in 2020,"It’s going to be really scary taking on some of the things i’d like to achieve next year and failure will likely befall me. But even if it is does that’s okay, because failure is just a stage in the process of success. It allows us to grow and learn, it’s how we make better choices moving forward in our lives.

Something i’ve come to realize over the course of the past two years is that I can’t just sit by and wait for better things to come, for this depression to up and bugger off. I have to fight it. I have to make a concious effort to take charge and push myself. 

That’s why I want to start off with basic excersise. It doesn’t have to be anything too daunting and I don’t need to get any fancy equipment. I can just begin with sit ups and push ups on my bedroom floor and the occasional run around the block. From there when I feel like i’m ready i’ll start looking into a gym membership and spend as much time as I possibly can in there, sure it’ll tire me out afterwards but my mind will slowly start to feel much more energised and capable.

Then once i’ve got a good thing going there, I can look into driving lessons. If that goes well i’ll consider attending a college or finding a part time job. I’ll take it one step at a time and i’ll do my best to not overwhelm myself, cause if that happens I know i’ll get too scared and start to lock myself away again.

Sorry if this post is not appropriate here, doesn’t really feel right to post it anywhere else. 
I just want to feel in control of my life and be in a position where I feel like i’ve actually done something with myself. Thank you for reading this and hearing me get these thoughts out onto text. I hope 2020 is good to you."
906,i dont want any help,all thats on my mind are suicidal thoughts for couple months i keep researching about suicide im extremely anxious and anti social been to a therapist i just wasted my time
907,I just want it to be over,I'm so tired I've been working so hard and I feel like I've barely scraped the surface I'm over working so damn hard and not getting anywhere I just want a normal life I feel like I'm being punished sometimes like karma is making me pay so other people's lives can be easier I'm fighting to hold on but theres nothing left to grasp anymore sometimes life just isn't worth it and that sucks to have to live with

I don’t even know if I can come back to school next year without holly around.. and I know that’s fucked up that shes gone and I’m thinking about money and I shouldn’t be. It just feels like the universe doesn’t want me around. All the shit going on in my life just makes me so depressed which, obviously im aware of but I wasn’t aware until recently that it pushes people away. The only way I can keep friends is if I fake it and act really happy and really nice.. and for boyfriends? Forget it. Intimate relationships are a ticking timebomb for me. In the end, when they say “its not you, its me” It’s always me. I’m too much. I’m broken, I’m broke and my family is crazy. I have nothing to over the people around me except for a “success” story- which is a success for me but in the real world just catching up to everyone else… and even then, I’m still behind. I’m still majoring in something that won’t make me any money because I couldn’t handle something harder and I’m still broke and constantly so stressed about it that I feel sick.

As a child I was constantly cold and hungry and waiting for my dad to come home from driving around drunk, staying up at night preparing easter baskets and cooking for my younger siblings. I idolized my suicidal father and it made me a people pleaser and a guys-girl. I spent most of my time with my nerdy now unemployed brother and that made all my interests video-game centered and as a result I’m out of touch with most people and honestly unlovable. For the last few nights, my boyfriend and I have gotten into a long upsetting discussions surrounding how difficult dating me is and how difficult being in a long term relationship is in college. He said he wanted to try seeing someone else during winter break (which is a month long) and when upset, I asked him if I’ve gained weight and he said honesty I have and I have less of an hourglass figure and my ass isn’t as fat. So I think that situation was the catalyst of me feeling this way."
909,Random shit coming from a 13 yr old,So like most epic gamers I play fortnite but my “FRIENDS” quit to play nfl and shit so then they think it’s a good idea to hate on me for playing it. But then let all of their other friends off the hook?? Yeah makes sense. Then when I argue back they say shit like “Oh stop getting defensive!” And since I’m a 13 year old and sensitive as fuck it really hurts my feelings. Sorry if I sound like some total dick head.
910,Do you sometimes wish to go to sleep and never wake up?,"Do you just feel tired of life? You don´t even cry anymore because you are so tired of everything. You don´t care about your family situation anymore. Everyone is a mess in my family and now I am too. Going to sleep is the only thing that makes me happy. The idea of going to sleep and never waking up is heartwarming for me in some way. I am sick of the system we are living in and it feels like there is no way out except death. The only important question in my life is to whether commit suicide or not. But it seems like I enjoy to suffer or else I would have killed myself long ago. 

I just wanted to write down my feelings. I don´t even have the balls to go to a therapist."
911,Tried to share my personal issue with one of my self-esteem problems on here last night as many people struggle with this as well. Got 1200 karma. Many people agreed and gave great feedback. Then post was deleted.,"Okay, so I made a trending post on here last night about the phrase “if you don’t love yourself, how can you love anyone else?” and how I believe that phrase is stupid. Many people agreed with me and gave great tips on how to love oneself and that is associated with depression. 

The mods of this subreddit thought that my post wasn’t “depressed” enough and removed the entire post. I am definitely depressed and I assume all 1,200 up voters are as well. 

Is this removal uncalled for? What did I do wrong? How am I not depressed enough to have a post that stays on here?"
912,I’ve done too good a job pretending to everyone I know that everything is okay and I’m just fine...,"...I’m not, I’ve always been this way though. All good to the outside world, but withdrawing into my mind isolating myself and alone. 

I don’t know what to do or where to start a part of me is just hurt nobody has noticed I haven’t made a social media post in about 6 months.  I’m stuck looking at everyone enjoying their holiday season why I remain completely buried by the weight of everything going on in my life.

PS I’m tired of looking for therapists who do nothing for me I know the first one doesn’t always take but I just find myself talking with nothing of substance being recriprovated. 

I’m started to wonder what the point is."
913,I haven't spoken on this in 17 years. I was the victim of hazing,"

I tried to pledge a fraternity in college. I'm not totally stupid as to the goings on during these processes but I did it anyway. During the second week. After a night of being left in the woods and getting hit with a paddle to the point of dropping to my knees and crying I was understandably exhausted. The next day on campus I passed out and fell. I dont remember if I hit my head. I was helped back to my room and my girlfriend at the time convinced me to go to the hospital where I stayed the next 2 days. 

I never told my mom why I was hospitalized. I was scared. I also was afraid for her health. She had a stroke earlier in the year. Dealt with her half her body getting paralyzed due to stress. I believe it was bells palsy.   Her and my dad were going through a nasty divorce and separation and part of me didnt want her to stress out over me. my dad was acting like a complete fuckwad and stressing her out, last thing I needed to do was tell her was ""Hey I let some guys fuck me up, take my money and theres nothing I could do about it!"" i  never told my roommates. I just felt like I was in adequate and less of a man. Being made to feel less then you are just has a rippling effect. I thought well maybe I should be a man and deal with it. I tried to manage it best I could. Which in the long run of this thing called life was the wrong thing to do. i had this stupid notion in my mind that a man doesnt tattle. Or that in this case I wasnt man enough to be a member of the frat. 

The frat even asked me to finish the pledge process and they promised not to put their hands on me. Essentially I would be allowed to finish but there was gonna be an asterisk. no red stripe for you.  The guy who pledged me tried to explain that the guys I pledged with tried to pledge the year before and quit. Some of his brothers had grudges or some shit.  I didnt continue. 

I never talk about how it traumatized me. I spent my last few years of college paranoid, afraid to show my face because I felt like the kid who let some ass fucks abuse me.  That they all knew it and they were laughing at me behind my back and in my face. I think I only really came out my room for work, classes and to play madden with my roommates. Led to me losing a 4 year military scholarship. I at one point was so terrified of walking past the military science building that I would take weird routes around the campus. I started having panic attacks seeing ppl in uniform. I was close to dropping out all together. 3 classes away and I didnt care. i wanted to leave, me and my mom fought over that. You may think I should've went to the military science professor, I was afraid to. He was verbally abusive and I didnt feel comfortable telling him what happened. He had a different way of treating scholarship cadets. Every time I bring this up even thinking about it in my head I feel like less of a man. I dont know if my health issues at the time were all related or not. The blackouts. Constant breathing issues.  I ended up having to do a minor heart procedure at 21 due to the situation. 

Looking back on it now, the depression, anxiety, general fucking trauma from what I went through, what was going on with my mom. I just felt alone, really alone. Its given me a general sense of distrust period. Still to this day. I should have reported it. I have not been back to Morgan state since I graduated in 2006. i tried go back for a homecoming one year, girl I was dating wanted to go. It felt so uncomfortable for me. I didnt want to run into those guys again, or anyone from their sister organization. I was scared, I still am.  Whatever. It is what it is. 

I just dont want this shit to happen to anyone else. sure practices like this still go on. If not with this organization surely another. also kinda tired of people asking me what's wrong. I know I show it more around the holidays. everything hits harder."
914,I don't want to feel happy,"I have no will to actually feel good and enjoy things. Whenever something happens that should make me feel happy or excited, I don't want it to happen, I guess it's because I'm too scared that if I'm happy, something terrible will happen. But I'm not entirely sure what actually causes the feeling.

For example, this new film I have been waiting for for like 3 years finally came out, it was made by my favourite band and I've even donated $20 to them, but now that I have the chance to watch it, I just... Don't want to. It's like my brain hates actually enjoying things. Even if I get happy for a while, I immediately get absolutely sick of that feeling."
915,I need to vent (again),"My teacher sees that I’m acting different and keeps asking if I’m okay. I’ve been lying to her and I’m torn between telling her or not. If I tell her, all hell will break loose, but then I would have an adult who could help me with this."
916,"I'll delete this in a bit, just needed to let it out, no one is answering my texts","I feel really choked up and tired, I think I'm going to fail all my classes this semester with 5 F's and I'm so scared I'm going to get expelled or something. I feel like I should just end \*\* \*\*\*\* before anything happens. I just feel really pathetic for being this weak and I don't how to explain it all to my parents who work their asses off everyday to provide for me and pay my tuition and everything. 

I'm so scared, I don't know what I'm doing with my life, I have no passions or interest in anything, why am I even here. I think I have ADHD on top of my undiagnosed depression as well so everything is just so hard to do. 

I'm just sick of being a burden to everyone and being alive. I don't think I was meant for human life because most days I'm just in bed as if I'm on the verge of death (may as well be) and I get up to eat only because my mom makes all the meals. It's so hard going to sleep every night wishing I was dead and waking up feeling the same way."
917,"I never agreed to this fucking shit, why does everyone expect me to smile and play along?",I really don't want to die but what the fuck am I supposed to do? It's either 50 more years of shit or 5 minutes of fear.
918,"I've been officially diagnosed with depression and prescribed antidepressants, but I still half feel like I'm faking it because my symptoms don't match the typical descriptions of depression I've always heard about","So the thing is, every time I've seen someone describe depression, they either describe it as constantly feeling sad, angry or irritated, or having absolutely no energy or motivation to do anything, even so much as get out of bed in the most severe cases, they see no joy in life and at some point want to harm or kill themselves.

But I feel happy enough most of the time. I'm actually very fucked up emotionally and internally, and if I take a good, honest look at myself, I have zero self-confidence and see very little hope in my future... But I've become so good at repressing those feelings that most of the time I actually feel happy. Yes, I'm very unproductive, my studies are falling apart, I've achieved almost nothing in my life because I'm too insecure and don't have a foundation of learning to cope with challenges in life (helicopter parenting), and a lot of the time just feel too mentally tired or overwhelmed to do anything too challenging, and then there's social anxiety...

... but I still love life. I think life is beautiful, I've always been too scared and repulsed by pain to have any desire to harm myself, and I've always been able to maintained this delusion of optimism, that somehow some day life will get better. It doesn't take much to make me feel better, even if I'm having a bad day, I can just come home and watch my favourite TV show and everything seems fine again. I've never wanted to end my life, I've only felt sad that life seemed to pass me by while I was just standing on the sidelines, living vicariously through other people or books or films. It's not a healthy way of coping, mostly I've just been running away from my problems, but I've almost always been able to find joy in life and still enjoy my hobbies like reading, writing or listening to music. I have very few friends and I should feel lonely a lot, except most of the time I'm able to distract myself with escapism or daydreaming.

I've had some periods with what seemed like typical depression, like having rubbish piling up in my room and not showering because I had no motivation to do even basic self-care, but those were short-lived.

The psychiatrist wasn't much help at all, she kept interrupting me every few words and it looked like she was just eager to prescribe the meds and get it over with, so now I'm kind of scared to start the antidepressants... On one hand, I'm sick of having no motivation or self-confidence to do anything even remotely difficult, and feeling nervous every time I'm talking to someone I don't know well. However, I can't help feeling like the root causes of my issues would be better addressed through therapy, while antidepressants might actually make me feel worse by numbing down positive feelings along with negative ones and killing my libido (that one seems like a universal SSRI side effect, from what I've heard).

Am I just being unreasonable? Do you think I should get a second opinion or just take the antidepressants as told and see how it goes? (I should mention I've been to a GP for the same reason a couple of years ago but she barely let me get 10 words out before saying ""yep, that's depression"" and prescribing SSRIs, which I didn't take at the time)."
919,Would it be selfish of me to go back to uni early...?,"So I’m pretty sure I’ve suffered from depression for a long time (since early teens maybe - I’m 22 now), but was only diagnosed and started on anti-depressants this September gone. 

To keep this short, coming home from university (which is 7+ hours away) is basically revisiting trauma for me. Anxiety from parents, I was assaulted in my home by an ex a couple years ago, just many memories I’d rather not dig up, but I seem to feel them even if I’m not consciously thinking about any of it and it really takes it’s too whenever I come home. It hasn’t felt like home in a long time, I’ll be honest, so I tend to only come back to ‘check in’, out of feeling obligated to come back I guess. 

Basically, I’ve only been home for literally one night now and I already feel pretty awful, on edge, just in a significantly worse state than I would be at uni. I haven’t cut in months, but whenever I come back here the urges come back, I feel anxious in the morning when I hear my mum complaining about something and overall I just feel sh*t. I’m meant to be staying until around January 4th (2 and a bit weeks), but I’m really not sure if I could stand to be here that long, but I know I’d feel guilty about leaving (although I would mentally feel better within myself, if that makes sense). 

Sorry this turned out being quite long...but would I be a terrible person for leaving earlier?"
921,Who can diagnose and treat depression?,"So do I need to see my primary care physician and explain my symptoms for a diagnosis? Or do I go right to a psychiatrist? Or do I see my PCP and get a referral to a psychiatrist?

924,Feeling disconnected/in a dream,"Hello!

I have dealt with depression for about 16 years on and off now. Now it's just part of life, and I can't imagine life without it.

The past couple of years I have been in a bad relationship. I finally got out of it this summer. I struggle A LOT with calling it an abusive relationship, because so many things have been very comfortable and nice, but at the same time there was so much manipulation going on. And after ending it he ""turned"" our mutual friends against me, and that fucking sucks, because I can't defend myself.

I have been under so much stress and pain these past six months that the feeling of disconnection and pointlessness has gotten so much more severe. I have felt disconnected from the world and hopeless for a long time, like I'm in a dream, but now I question if my life is real, and I can''t see the point of living. I feel like I'm all alone, and that the world is just a reflection of my mind.  
I know logically that I'm alive and exist, and that other people exist, but it doesn't FEEL right.

I have been googling the stuff I have been feeling, like ""why does life feel like a dream"", and I have learned about something called depersonalization/derealization, and also something called dissociation. A lot of the stuff I read really resonates with me, but when I talk to family and friends about it I feel like an idiot and a fraud, because it sounds so rediculous. I even feel awkward talking to my therapist about it, and I'm so scared that someone is thinking that I'm just making stuff up, that I'd rather just not seek help.

My mood shifts a lot, and when I'm in a really good period I can't relate to the other part of myself AT ALL, nor the other way around. If I have written down my feelings while very depressed and read it again when I'm in a good period, I feel like I have no idea who the person who wrote that is.

Sorry if this seem really disorganized. I hadn't really planned what to write exactly.

I think I mostly want some help (as much as can be done online anyway) with figuring out what and why I'm feeling like nothing is real and everything is pointless.  
I got an apointment with my therapist tomorrow, so any help on how to relay what these feelings are would be helpful. :S

Thank you so much for reading all of this.

925,Has anyone repaired a friendship after depression?,"This is my first post and I’m typing it on my phone, so hopefully it’s not confusing! I’ve struggled with PTSD, depression, and anxiety since I was 10ish and am 26 now. In college, I made “friends” and was so happy to finally not be alone. But realized they weren’t true friends, and someone I considered close is now engaged to a man who sexually assaulted me multiple times and is supported by most of my friends.

Since my abuse, I’ve tried to hide feelings. I recently got my Masters in school counseling and had an amazing supervisor (F30) for 2 years. She opened up to me about her struggles, and we began to get close. I began to trust her and opened up. At the beginning, I downplayed it but then began to reveal my actual struggles. She would tell me how I wouldn’t be alone and would always have her. On my last day of internship, she told me that she would rather have me texting her all day than lying in bed and not talking to anyone.

At the beginning, she was reaching out to me to check in. I began to feel supported and actually was able to open up to my therapist about the extent of my trauma because of this support. She even wrote me a note that said to remember that I can always reach out and will always have a caring friend in her. I trusted her and she became like a big sister to me. She was struggling too at this time as her boyfriend of 4 years broke up with her. But she kept talking to me. I began to text her more, typically multiple times a week. She never said anything about it. She began to seem off when school began but said she was busy.

I began to really struggle around September due to my meds. During this time, I texted about suicidal thoughts. The first weekend in October, I reached out about this and asked if she would be willing to call my psychologist to let him know. She did, but then said that it was the limit of what she can do and she couldn’t support me how I need. Then she said she wasn’t leaving me but needed to take time to focus on her, and would reach out when she was ready.

My therapist was advising me on when to reach out and what to say to repair my friendship. I would wait a few weeks before texting about things like rebalancing our friendship. She never replied to any of these. Over Thanksgiving, I messed up and texted quite a bit. That Tuesday I texted that I had a gift for her (I made her a gift of 365 notes for her 30th birthday and she cried telling me no one had done anything like this before so wanted to do that again). Texted on Thanksgiving to wish her a happy Thanksgiving, as my therapist said to do. My next session was that Monday, and my therapist said to share how my suicidal thoughts are gone now that I changed meds. My friend lost a friend to suicide a few years ago and while she reassured me that she was ok talking about it, it may have gotten to be too much. So I reached out sharing that. I also reached out Monday evening saying it’s been 2 months and asking if she could react to a message so I knew she was alive and ok (have anxiety about people dying after losing 3 family members in less than 3 months). She replied and said she had told me she would contact when she was ready to reach out and I have not respected that. She said she wishes me the best but to please not reach out to her again. I panicked and said I wouldn’t and was trying to give her space, and I hoped she would give me a second chance. 2 days later, I texted explaining that I didn’t realize I shouldn’t text at all and wasn’t trying to disrespect her but I understood now. Then realized she blocked me.

I am so panicked. I was trying to repair the friendship but instead ruined it. My therapist said to now work on getting better to help repair the friendship eventually. Has anyone been able to repair a friendship they ruined due to being too clingy or dependent after recovering from depression?"
926,I’d pay to get rid of this addiction and fuck bitches instead lol.,
927,"Stress, Depression &amp; Work - Advice Please","First post here - Sorry it's a long one.

I just want some advice over whether it's acceptable to take some time off work in my situation...

Two weeks ago my husband told me he had gambled away our house deposit and was around 10k in debt through loans taken out to fund 2 years of a hidden gambling addiction. We lost the house I had been in the process of buying, which I had been saving for for so long (our money is separate so my savings are safe at least...). I went to stay with my parents for a few days. During this time my husband also got a psychiatric diagnosis of severe adult ADHD (which is the cause of a lot of other problems) and was prescribed medication which we are currently waiting for. 

Conveniently, I had four days off due to my shift pattern, but then immediately went back to work and went back to our apartment and have tried to just forge on while dealing with all this as best I can. 

Initially, his parents were supportive and came to talk to him at our apartment while I was gone. But they have since virtually disowned him. So this has all been left for me to deal with alone. I've tried to look after myself while dealing with his recovery and finances, but people with ADHD can't organise or prioritise at all, so it takes a lot of energy. 

I have a long history of intermittent depression. it's something I have to be mindful of daily to keep me positive and not slipping back into. After all this, I've been in shock, incredibly stressed and just numb. I've been crying at night, in the bath, waiting for the kettle to boil - and especially at work. I'm not myself and have a constant feeling of dread and for the last two days have had intrusive thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. Eg - when driving to work I'll have a sudden thought like 'You could swerve into that truck and it would all just go away'. To be clear: I don't want to harm myself at all, I think the stress has just completely mangled my brain. 

Work has been really difficult for me. I work in a hospital and it's a very care-orientated environment where you have to give a lot of yourself. I'm seeing my GP in the morning because today I realised I'm just not coping. I was sent home early. My colleagues and even managers are all part of a big friend group and have been very supportive, but now I'm not sure what to do when I go to the GP. 

I really want to take some time off because my MH is so poor right now. 

However, I was signed off last summer for 3 weeks for a very different reason. We were extremely short staffed (12 empty spots on our rota of around 35 people) and I was working 80-100 hours of night shifts a month for around 6 months, because the person in charge of our rota mistakenly thought I liked them. This was not constant night shift work. Our shifts are random every week, so I would do early shifts, on calls, 12 hour days, into nights and then back to earlies. I was only sleeping for 4-5 hours every week towards the end of this and began hallucinating. I was forced to take time off by my GP because I began demonstrating physical ailments from sleep deprivation (cluster headaches and nerve damage). I was given prescription sedatives. I came back to work and dropped to 4 days a week and was given an apology by my manager who had failed to feedback to our rota staff that I was struggling with nights. 

I've been told by my line manager that I'm next in line for promotion in April next year as I've been putting a lot of effort in to helping our department this year. But I'm worried that another period of being signed off will damage this. On the other hand, in the last 6 months I know of 4 other people in the department who have been signed off with stress/MH, so it's not exactly uncommon.

I've done a lot of positive and useful things at work lately and my department manager is aware of my home situation and said to just keep him updated when I told him I was seeing my GP. Would it be unreasonable to take 1-2 weeks out?

928,I’m so lost.,This has been the hardest year of my life and it’s showing no signs of getting better. I’m tired deep to my bones and I just want it to stop. I’ve been through so much this year and now I’m possibly facing being homeless. What do you do when you can’t handle it anymore because it hurts so much? I’m just so tired...
929,can’t eat can’t sleep and now i’m excited to try something new that my doctor prescribed!,"i have been on Paxil since october 1st and the main goal was to try and help me eat. I’m 6’1.5 and i’m only 116lbs. which means i’m in a negative percentile for my height to weight. kinda weird to think about but i have not gain too much weight since the last time i was at the doctors and they were questioning why. 

this is when i game clean about my illicit cocaine addiction which quickly snowballed into a 14 straight binge. no pun intended. none the less he prescribe me something new, Remeron. 

i’m excited to try this because it will help all three of my current issues, anxiety from the coke withdrawls and heart problems, eating habits, and sleep. i’m just having a lot of trouble figuring out if it’s an SSRI or not. i’m gonna keep on researching."

932,Hating rant on basic bitch life advice,"I'm so fucking done with people saying: lIfE iS pOsItIvE, yOu HaVe YoUr OwN dEsTiNy In YoUr OwN hAnDs, blablabla...

Tell that to people dealing with chronic mental health issues, living in war zones, dealing with trauma and abuse for years, for sure makes them feel better and not making them feel bad for feeling shitty 24/7 for 98% of their life at least. (that was sarcasm for the people who didn't understand) 

I lost my positive spirit and feeling like some day it will get better over a year ago. Until that point I tried to hold on that everything happens for a reason, but I fucking can't anymore. Years and years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse (what was the most ""easy"" part of my life cause shit got more weird and intense I can't even explain). 

I always forgave the people hurting me, understanding where they come from. I don't even know anyone who honestly is that strong minded as I am, not to sound arrogant, but I know for sure people telling me that wouldve killed themselves over 10 years ago if they would've walked in my shoes. I never played victim, but I feel so fucking goddamn unhappy, hurt, abandoned, uncared for, unfulfilled and lost even though I know who I am as a soul and a person. If that basic bitch advice was true I would have been one of the most successful people already, but I am definitely not. Sometimes it's like I have a serious curse put on me. 

The ""spiritual"" community also makes me angry as fuck because of this, with their basic ""law of attraction"" advice, and that it's just me that causes me to have so much trauma and bad shit happening to me.

I am a good person, who knows their boundaries, is sweet and understanding to everyone, but I tell you the truth when I see bullshit. So don't fucking tell me that I just need to be positive in order to have a happy and fulfilling life. I don't have family or even a friend who seriously cares for me as much as I do care for people. 


Fuck you."

935,Loneliness,"I have made so many posts on this subject on reddit recently...

I have been lonely all of my life. A 23 years old I have   no friends. I am not close with my parents or siblings or anyone else in my family. There is not a soul in the world I am close too. Making friends is the hardest thing in the world for me. And keeping them? Impossible. And of course I choose a career (software developer) that is as lonely as it can get. I work in an office with hundreds of people yet most days hardly say a few words to anyone while I am there. It is soul crushing. When I was a teenager my mom thought I  had autism that maybe true. Very high functioning autism maybe. I'm not even really socially anxious anymore I like being around people. I just can't for the life of me form a connection with somebody that lasts.  I dont know how I can. The past few months it has all come to a head. I am unhappy from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. As I get older it seems less likely I will ever have friends much less a family or anyone in my life.

Today is a bad day. Yesterday was too. I don't know how I can make tomorrow better."
936,Should I tell my friend they saved my life?,"I’ve been really depressed for a while and frequently suicidal. I still am, but a month and a half ago, I almost did it.

I’d just gotten some really bad news and they gave me some really helpful resources and a concrete step that had a small chance of making things better. I’d been in the process of making final arrangements, but I told them I’d try the thing they suggested the next day. Then by that next day, I decided there were still a couple things left I could try to improve my health and situation.

Should I tell my friend that their action saved me that day? Is this the sort of thing that people like to know?

We’re decently close online friends, but I’ve never met them and have only known them for less than a year."
937,Feels like no one cares,"(24/F if that matters) I’ve got to this point where I’m so sick of visiting my family/friends when no one visits me. They always ask me to come to them instead and if I don’t they think I’m mad at them or make me feel bad.

The one that has been getting to me more over the past couple of years is my dad. We have a pretty good relationship I guess. I mean, we don’t fight or anything and we hang out sometimes but only when I come see him. And I’m not trying to say he’s a bad dad or anything, I’m lucky to have him, and he’s kill someone over me if it came to it, it’s just that even though I know he loves me I wish he would show it, ya know? 

He never calls, at all, he might send me a text if I haven’t come to see him in over a week but he only started doing that in the past six months. Sometimes I’ll come over and stay the night just to see him and my stepmom and he’ll stay gone the whole next day so me coming to spend time is pretty useless. 

He has been to my place approximately three times in three years and I live twenty minutes away from him. 

Idk. I’m just frustrated and it doesn’t help to bring up that he never visits bc he just says “yeah I know, I dont go see anybody and I know I should. I think about it a lot though.” But in this case I think the saying “it’s the thought that counts” is bs because where’s the effort? 

I just feel like I am always the one doing the most and no one else cares enough to put in the same effort even just once in a while. It sucks. And it makes my depression worsen in these situations. Like right now, I’ve come to see my dad after not seeing him in over two weeks bc he messaged me two days ago checking on me and I told him yesterday that I was going to stop by but he hasn’t answered my calls all day so I drove by his house but he’s not here and I’ve been sitting out here for over an hour waiting to see if he’s going to come back anytime soon but it doesn’t look like it so this trip was wasted so yeah. And he hasn’t answered my calls because he leaves his phone at home so I can’t get in touch with him, so there’s no way to let him know I’ve been sitting out here for over an hour.

I’m just sad. And venting. 😞"
938,Cannibalistic Urges Towards Women,"Disclaimer: This is NOT a troll post or a joke, so please take it seriously. Thank you for reading. 

So I haven't dated or had sex in a few years now because I have the urge to eat women and I don't want to act on it. What started out as a casual interest in serial killer documentaries has morphed into an unhealthy desire to copy the things that cannibalistic serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish did. I'm no stranger to healthy relationships either - I've dated some wonderful ladies, with each relationship lasting multiple months/years. It was a privilege to learn and grow with all of these women, none of them were ever abusive or cruel towards me, and I always strived to be an absolute gentleman towards them :). 

I think something is psychologically wrong with me though. I grew up with a mom who constantly called me ugly, stupid, worthless, and every other insult under the sun, who would throw things at me and tell me these things since I was a toddler. She would dump my toys out all over the floor and scream at me to pick them up, telling me I was a piece of crap that should get out of her face, she'd say she never wanted to see me again and that she was going to kill herself (she never did), etc. She ended up running a meth den in our house, dealing drugs, stealing, and working as a prostitute. The point I'm trying to make is that I wonder if these childhood experiences have shaped my subconscious outlook towards women. I'm in my early 20s now, and apparently the average serial killer begins harming people around age 28. I DO NOT want to end up doing that. Life is precious, and I care about people too much to follow through with my urges. I just worry that I won't be able to control myself in the future.

Lastly, I really want to go to therapy, but I'm afraid that I'll get involuntarily hospitalized, which I can't financially afford at all. I just dont know what to do and I'm hoping maybe someone out there has been in a similar situation and can offer some advice. It doesn't even have to be cannibal related, you could be a pyromaniac or a kleptomaniac or something. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope everyone has a good week."
939,I woke up happy today!,Hopefully it lasts more than a couple hours and it isn't my brain playing a sick joke on me like the usual.
941,I'm in the ER right now,"And I hope they will take me to the mental hospital in the morning when i sober up, because i would feel better there than in my home"
942,I just wanna cry,"Almost everytime, when I am (male18) in School  I just think ""I want to go home, lie on my bed and just Start to cry"" but then I actually just pretend that everything is fine, eben though this is in my head constantly. I am depressed but I actually do not  know if this is normal because I am depressed for longer then a year and I never had this before.

Sorry for my Bad english."
943,What will eventually kill me will be my pride,I wasn’t strong to tell anybody the truth. I able to because of my pride. I thought I could figure something out. I wasn’t. Every decision I made I thought it was the right one but really it was just another shortcut or quickly fix. I choose this way I hate to amid it but I did thought I could figure something out. Start on the right path with getting help but ultimately failed because I don’t honestly I just want left. It happen really quickly I didn’t know to stop it. But at the end of the day there was nothing anybody could do to save me. I hope my family and friends understand that but I know they won’t. It was just too late me. I want you to know that started to Seek God more and want to give him the appreciation that he deserves over my life. I didn’t do it in the past but I want to give it to him now. I understand that you have in order for your life to change you do the work. I wasn’t able too because I’m too prideful. I can admit when I’m wrong but can’t seem to take the necessary action to make things right. I just don’t see the purpose anymore it too late. I feel like I chose death long time ago. I honestly don’t know if I was even trying in the last two months to get right. I just know it too late for me I’m just too prideful .
944,Finally looking for a therapist,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety and what I would call mild / moderate depression for over a year, maybe 2 years up to this point. Certain aspects of my life have gone down hill recently and it’s been a wake up call to me. I realize that trying to work this out and fight through it by myself, with a little help from my friends, is not only not working, but making things worse for me in ways I hadn’t realized. So I decided to start looking for a therapist to start seeing to help me with these problems. Anyone have any advice or tips on how to find the right therapist for me, or even start this whole process? Just nervous about all of this and want to make sure I do this the right way."
945,Currently unsure of my mental state.,"I’m unsure if I deserve to be sad. However, it also feels wrong to try and be happy right now.

I’ve been depressed for a while, what else is new. But, I recently found out a person that helped me out a while ago was also suffering pretty badly. They even tried to harm themselves pretty severely. They’re getting help now though. However, I feel terrible for not being able to do anything. I feel even worse just for feeling bad, because they’re obviously going through so much more than I ever have. My own depression feels like nothing compared to theirs.

I also can’t stand the thought of losing them, although that’s just the paranoia creeping in. I know it’s best to try and keep going, but I can’t just up and start feeling positive when someone I care about is dying inside. It’s even worse that I can’t even ask if they’re doing okay.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Sorry for the vent."
946,I'm worried about my parents,"I really want to end my life, but I'm worried about my parents. I don't want to make them sad, but I cannot continue anymore."
947,Almost broke down at work today..,"In advance.. I am sorry for the long post. So read at your discretion.

I’ve suffered from depression since the 6th grade. Stemming from bullying and fake friends but at that age, it’s kind of hard to find the real ones. My life has never been easy. Constant moving meant losing friends frequently. And when I wouldn’t lose them from distance, I lost them because they outgrew me. And that hurts.. just picturing them not wanting to be friends with me anymore.

So I went to a form of friendship that is more long lasting and found relationships. All my relationships have been long term. Filled will love and fun. But.. they always ended. Something always broke. And that’s life, right? But now.. things have been harder.

My last relationship was an amazing one.. but filled with many, many fights. Which is something I’m not used to. I’m great with communication and compassionate. I always tried hard but it wasn’t enough. But early in that relationship, my S/O was impregnated by me, not planned, but hey, shit happens. So we decided to keep it. Throughout the pregnancy, things were great. But the further we went, the more fights broke out. And sure, some could say it was just the hormones but they consistently got worse.. and quickly. I did my best to soothe things over again and again but the worst of it came after the baby shower. The downhill to it all.

But let’s skip all that because it’s a huge story in itself.

After my child’s birth, we kept on together. But the fights never stopped. And the good days came less and less. So mutually, we ended things to be better parents. The responsible thing. But with that, came more hurt. More fights. Bickering and nit-picking the parenting I was doing. It was wrong in her eyes but not wrong to anyone else because I was taught and guided by my parents. So she kept my child from me when she felt like punishing me. Reduced my days with him. Anything.. just to hurt me and “teach me a lesson.”

We eventually got past it all when we spoke like actual adults and she explained where all her unwarranted anger stemmed from. Because she was angry she could not stop loving me. But I had my own fails.

I failed to provide everything I could the first time round. I had baggage I couldn’t get rid of. Which held me back from giving my full potential to her. So.. we tried again after I confided in myself and let my baggage go.

Now.. the next part is pain I never felt.

We tried and enjoyed the times. Arguments came but much, much less than before. We were happier. We took a vacation, just the two of us and it was amazing but we had our first terrible fight then. She frequently pointed out how “we aren’t together officially” and that broke me down every time the words left her mouth. Like it’s a reason for the bad. I gave it my all.. my absolute all this time around. But things broke and she finally ended things. But not before an intimate night where she implied that I was just like any other guy she would mess around with and telling me that she was talking to someone in the end..

So.. that leads me to today. Where we still talk because we have to co parent. But things are hard. My only friend who I’ve been closed to for over 6 years doesn’t ever reach out to me. Enjoying nights out without even me coming to mind. And yes, he knows how much I appreciate him, his friendship, and how I think of him with events. And this happens all the time. And now.. hopelessly holding onto a future with the child’s mother because of how happy she makes me. The fights were worth the happiness she brought. But now..

How can I trust I can make anyone happy? How can I trust that I am enough for someone? After what she did. After what she told me. I’ve never been so broken in my days.

So now I sat at work.. thinking about how I wish I could have a friend to just keep me company. Or a relationship I knew I was enough in and loved. Someone to text and talk to throughout the day to keep my mind on better things. And these thoughts.. thoughts of those days possibly not coming, is what broke me.

I held tears back today. Loneliness has always been my deepest depression. And today.. I couldn’t handle it, not even the thought."
948,Book recommendations for being a better partner to someone with depression?,"Title pretty much says it!

I'm looking for a recommendation for a book that would help me understand what I can do to be a more supporting and caring partner to someone with depression, possibly one that also describes what depression feels like so I can empathize. 

I appreciate your help (:"
949,Break up,I’ve went through a break up recently and honestly I don’t get what’s with my ex like it’s been on my mind recently she has found a new boyfriend and the reason she broke up with me cause we had arguments and like wouldn’t all relationships have arguments I was wondering if her current relationship had arguments what’s gonna happen next she’s gonna find another relationship I find it so annoying..
950,"I wish there was a way to let people experience depression for a certain amount of time, then maybe people would understand","I wish I could let non-depressed people experience depression for a certain amount of time, like a day. Then maybe they would be more willing to help."
951,Out of meds for the next 9 days,"Hi all, new to reddit so let me know if this belongs somewhere else. I’m 20 and my family just moved several states away in recent months. My psychiatrist’s prescription has run out...today is my first day off my meds (Zoloft 50mg) and I have an appointment with a new doctor on the 26th where I will hopefully get a refill but this is my first time I’ll be off medication, even if it’s a short time, since I was 14 and I don’t really know what to do and I’m scared. Is there any way to make this easier? Does anyone have any advice?"
952,What kind of therapist..,"I'm looking for a therapist for my partner who is feeling dispair at modern society and the system, his place in it and how he can point himself. Can anyone tell me what specialism this would be, or if there is such thing as a mentor for people with lack of hope/path?"
953,If I knew what I know now I would've just killed myself when I was 14,"All this pain and suffering, hurting other people, wasting people's time, dragging myself through life just to be in the same place 8 years later. This fucking medicine doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm just tired of it."
954,It's been rough,"Honestly,  I'm just so exhausted everyday, waking up is getting too much effort, today I procrastinated for the numerous amount of times in this 3rd year of uni and all I can think about is if I'll make it past 21. Sometimes I wonder why I'm actually here, writing just this is hard but I needed to get something out my head can't take it anymore, the emotional pain is turning physically exhausting."
955,Do most severely depressed people eventually have to work or can you go on some form of social welfare/disability?,"I didn't work from the ages of 18-25. I went to college but mostly skipped classes or sat alone. And then I did a mostly online course and became a teacher. I've been working since I turned 26. So 3 years. 

I find it really difficult to keep up with work. I have severe social anxiety, generalised anxiety and depression. Sometimes one or more of these get so bad that I don't wash my hair or change my clothes for a few days. I nap after work. I don't really have a relationship with the people I work with. TL;DR I'm constantly hanging on by a thread. Is this life for most people with depression? Just deal with it and get on with things?"
956,How could I make my mom take my feelings seriously?,"I have this on-going problem with my mom that has been going on for 5 years. That problem is this:

Whenever I finally get the courage to tell her that I would like to go to a therapist or at least go to anyone who could tell me if I really am depressed or not she doesn't take it seriously. I've been asking since 8th grade, and recently when I asked again she just gave me false hope by agreeing before telling me she won't take me anywhere if I don't try "" Going on a diet,walking,sleeping well,eating well"" even though when I want to do anything ,I just can't because I've been feeling drained 24/7 , unable to even get out of bed or eat. I turned 18 this September and I would've went on my own to a therapist but I don't have any money of my own  or a job yet because it's hard to get one if you are born as a female in the country I live in.

What can I do? I feel like I'm ready to give up but I don't want that to be the choice I make."
957,I feel like a dumbass,"I woke up super sad for no apparent reason, felt like crying twice, called in to work because I didn't want to risk breaking down at work. Now I'm at home but I'm crazy restless and feel relatively ok. I hadn't been nonfunctionally depressed in a really long time so this was weird. Now I feel like a dumbass because I theoretically feel like I could've worked today but I can't just call and tell them I'm suddenly fine (I also didn't specify that it was mental, just that I didn't feel well). I also have my good friend (FWB/pseudo-partner situation) over and I have no clue if I want them around right now or what I need. 

I feel stuck in many ways and I'm not having fun."

960,"Festive season and no medication, what could possibly go wrong...","Christmas the time like so many others is where my loneliness seems to be magnified. I feel the sting when colleagues ask my plans as I know night after night I go home to empty home and just because it's holiday season doesn't suddenly make my home less empty. I feel it worse this time of year. My birthday is also on Christmas Day and it is a kicker to wake up alone that day. I cannot work it as my department closes for the main days, I looked into volunteering and nowhere wants to know as they are full. 

I could make it through, however I am also now out of my antidepressive medication. I had a small amount of money left and I had to decide between gas, food or my medication and gas took precedence for hot water and warmth and I can live on bread/toast for a little while. 

So I am seeing the festive loneliest time of the year in with severe plummet in my mood, crying episodes, having only some bread to look forward to and cannot even go to work to forget for several days. I need to be careful as I fear if not I will not make it to January. At least I have hot water and heating now as a cold snap has arrived and my windows are getting frost inside.

I am meditating, avoiding triggers the best I can i.e. social media, listening to sappy songs, alcohol and ciggies (easier when can't afford any). I am limiting my caffeine at work and walking/moving when I can. It is hard and a challenge and suddenly stopping medication is not advisable however it was preferable to freezing or not being able to wash.  

So merry Christmas to you all. I will be in bed with layers of clothing and a glorious meal of toast (dry), but it gets better. It needs to get better, and I need to get better. 

I am posting to rant and get of my chest my self pity. However whilst I am here, can anyone's suggest something to elevate my mood? Help with the medication withdrawal?

I am not seeking advice on finances, it is a bit of bad luck and soon to be rectified after Xmas, I am just whining and using it to explain why I have stopped my medication abruptly at undeniably the worse time."
961,I just can't fucking talk,"Everytime i have a conversation/discussion with someone about smth ridiculously irelivant, i always seem to find a way to fuck things up. Things just usually end with them saying 'nevermind, you don't understand what i'm saying'. And then when they say that i can't fucking help but re-enter the discussion to be understood on both sides. It even goes to a point where I dont even know what the fuck i just said or was saying. After i come to realise that i have no idea what the fuck ive been saying i just apoligise and say that i was probably in the wrong. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN THE CONVO/DISCUS IS OVER I LITERALLY DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OR WHAT I JUST SAID. So then, i just break down and overthink every single bit of the convo/discussion. Like where it went wrong, what i couldve prevented from saying or saying it differently, and just do better the next time.

 BUT THE PROBLEM AGAIN IS THAT I DONT KNOW WHAT I SAID OR WHAT HAS BEEN FUCKING SAID. 

Then i proceed to break down because i wanted to d--- 

SEE, I CANT EVEN FUCKING EXPLAIN THE SITUATION/STRUGGLE RIGHT NOW. FUUUUUUUUUCCK SAAKE, I JUST CANT FUCKING BRING MY FEELINGS INTO WORDS.

962,I am trapped behind my eyes watching this life go by,"When I was seven I wrote a pretty childish but sincere goodbye note to my family. I can remember desperately wanting to disappear but being too afraid to act on it. My older brother who was nine found the note and thought it was a joke. I watched through the window terrified as he laughingly showed my dad, who simply said it wasn't funny, folded it up and put it in his pocket. He never confronted me about it. My dad wasn't the type to shy away from difficult conversation, this left a big impression on me. It was my first experience with how people/society react to the topic of suicide. I never outwardly expressed those feelings again. Instead I put on a facade of normality that I've been wearing around ever since. Its thirty years later and I still have those same feelings that seven year old me had. On the surface I have a good life but if you dig the erosion caused by my poisoned soul is apparent. I've never shared this with anyone and even though you may be reading this, I feel as though I still haven't. For those that have quietly suffered, did you overcome it?"
963,I'm choosing to be like this?,"I finally told my nmom a few months back that I'm really depressed. She went on about how it's just a choice to be sad and lazy, but if I am really depressed, then I'll see help. Since she wouldn't help me, I found someone who might. Last week I got prescribed Cymbalta, and am going through that for the first time, and my nmom is still telling me that it's a choice and I'm just lazy and disrespectful of her, and she wants me to move out if I can't be happy. I have nowhere to go, and no money, as I'm on Social Security and she gets all the money. I don't know how to tell her or explain to her, literally anything."
964,Will depression always be something Ill have to deal with?,"Okay so.... i have been diagnosed With depression for 6ish years, aNd ADHD for like 8. The two are a really sucky combination and despite trying dozens of medications, I feel like I’m always going to be struggling with this. DOnt get me wrong, medication has helped me, but I feel like it just acts as a bandaid for a gunshot wound. I still have daily spells of sadness, anxiety, and hopelessnes, and Im so tired of dealing with it. I’m not suicidal and dont have any intent to end my life (although I have been in the past) but I just want to escape this cycle so badly. I go to a pretty competitive high school (thankfully I’m graduating soon) and I really hope than in college I will be able to find more purpose, but for now, I just feel stuck. There have been weeks where i feel pretty content, but then my depression just takes it away from me. I know that no Matter what, I will just end up feelind depressed like always. ITs hard. I know a lot of people can relate To this, especially those who have gone through high school with depression So I just wanted to know if anyone has any advice that could possibly help me get through this???"

To me, this is the worst part of it. I honestly continually wonder if it is the depression because it's so bad? I feel like I have been hit by a bus at all times, I have given up on all hobbies and interests because of it, ect. I feel like a shell of a person, and I am now in my mid 20s with nothing to show for it and no signs of improvement. Honestly, the sadness is debilitating in itself but I can deal with it. But nothing I have tried improves the constant mental and physical exhaustion. I have been depressed essentially my entire life, and I have had many other medical tests done to rule out other possibilities for exhaustion, and I am healthy otherwise. I feel like having achievements would make me happier/help my self esteem, and I love art and music and creating, yet I waste away in my bed every day thinking of all the things I would love to make and writing all these ideas down. I just never actually do them. It's like I'm trapped in this thick fog with no way out. You could say just FORCE yourself to do it, but you have no idea how hard even sitting up is half the time. And to get good at things, it takes constant practice which seems nearly impossible. I have NO idea what to do. Has anyone ever experienced this and it got better for them?

968,30yo. Been sufering for at least 15 years because of my appearence and how people stay away from me because of it,"Been contemplating suicide for the last year as I got out of copes...

I  see all my friends getting into relationships, marrying, having  children making new friends easily, no one talkes to me at work. While I  never had anything, absolutely 0.

I can send you pics, by private message so you can see Im not lying...

Whats the point of my life? Living alone for the rest of my life without meanfully friendships?

Its impossible to live a normal life looking like this, no one should have to live like this..."
969,FUCK!!!! I just want to be happy...,I'm tired of being numb and empty. I'm tired of everything.
970,I feel like I haven't budged in years.,"It's hard to know where to start, as I'm sure a lot of you can relate. I have generalized anxiety that I've been dealing with professional for about 8+ years now, but has been a constant thing in my whole life. And about 4 years ago realized that I have also been experiencing a low depression for most of my life as well that in the last 4 years has skyrocketed to medium-high.

I finished post sec almost two years ago and feel I have little to none to show for it. I've always had a problem with being productive when not structured even when I was little. I hated the summer since I always lost contact with friends, and didn't do much since I lived in a middle-low income home. I suffered a lot from social anxiety and I generally don't like going out so it made summers really lonely.

It's been really hard to find the motivation to do anything though. I studied to get into the games industry, which if you think about was possibly the worst with my lack of selfmotivation. But the only passion I've had is for the arts that I am good enough to persue a career in. I'm left with having to build something from scratch with the hopes of somehow building a strong enough portfolio to get a job in the next 5 years, if I'm even lucky enough to do that.

Speaking of, I'm on unemployment insurance because my last job location got shut down by the head company and I haven't been able to find a job since(bout 3 months now). I was hoping to be moved out by now but because of that, and my school debt, I can't afford to move out. I don't have enough money saved. My other older siblings are also at home. The middle, because they're not quite sure what they want to do still, and haven't had the best luck in keeping a job either. The oldest, because they went back to school to upgrade their career. Which they were successful in that and currently have a really good job, but because of a chronic illness, school debt from this and the last time, ALSO can't afford to move out. My parents are supportive though, understanding our situations and all of us try and help out so we're not completely free loaders. They've never been able to support us (as adults) finacially(which is why all of us are in debt), but have always tried to support us otherwise.

But the longer this goes on, the more I just don't care for living. It's been like this for a few years. I have always been scared of leaving school, not knowing how it was going to go, hoping that what I had done would've been good enough or be able to line things up to continue moving forward. I've been having breakdowns about it since highschool. But it of course didn't happen like that.

I don't speak to any of my rl friends, as I got tired from always being the one to instigate conversation or hang outs and so just stopped instigating, so I haven't heard from them in 6+ months now. My ex left me after having a break down and telling me that they had been afraid of me the whole 2 years that we'd been together and accusing me of being abusive. Everyone I've talked to professional and not has told me it was all them, but it still hurts. I had never been able to consieve commiting suicide till that happened, always been of the mind that I'm too much of a wimp to actually carry it out. Which is still true, but I actually tried to plan then for the first time. that happened last spring and I haven't gotten better moodwise.

So with no job, no outside obligations, and no friends. I haven't found the reason to go out other than to get med refills, my psyc appointments, and to get toiletries/food etc. I don't like bars or being out late, so I'm not interested in going to meetup things to meet new people and I don't want to be spending money because I don't have a job so it cuts out just about every possible way to meet new people. I'm bascially a hermit atm. For the most part I'm pretty content with it, it sucks, but I've always never had stable friends.

I still have a supportive family thank god cause nothing else positive has happened. I don't see a point to getting up in the morning or looking for another job. Even if I do find one and move out, I don't see my mood lifting. I don't see any positivity coming from my future and I never have. No matter how many times over my life that I have been trying to see the future as positive it just ends up back handing me. I'm so done with responsibility and everything. If I could waste away in a mental institute I would. Then I wouldn't have to burdern my family with my sorry-ass.

It's so hard to keep trying when it feels like my whole life has just been a downward spiral. I just want a break, for once in my life. I want to do nothing and it be okay. But I can't cause money rules the world and if I don't get any then I'm screwed.

Thank you for reading if you did, I haven't had anyone to talk to outside of my psyc and a few others for a while."
971,I kinda lied to my psych,"I’m on 75mg of Zoloft and I told him it was a good dose basically and that my anxiety and depression are under control. In reality I should have asked him to bump it up to 100mg because I think I may need a bigger dose.

I don’t see him for another month and a half. Would it be weird to call and reschedule it for a closer date so I can get my 100mg quicker?"

975,Is Doing Things for Yourself To Make You Happy Selfish?,"I was talking to my Dr. this morning and we got in a bit of banter about doing activities for the sole purpose of making me happy.   Given that I could always work more, do more for my family, etc., taking time for a frivolous activity for the sole purpose of improving my happiness seems very, very selfish.   If I was truly alone and had no other responsibilities, then fine, we all need stuff to fill the day.  But how do you justify activities when you have other things you could be doing.  

For the purposes of this question, Activities for Happiness includes things ranging from exercise to hobbies to self directed study not associated with ones work."
976,"I'm 33, and my life is completely over. I'm alive, but should be dead.","I'm not suicidal. I have no plan or method. Nothing like that. However, if a car happened to jump the curb today and turn me into tomato paste, I wouldn't protest.

I'm 33 years old. I'm long-term, chronically unemployed, with no college degree, and I still live with my parents. I am, by every cultural metric, a total fucking loser. I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 15/16. I was basically left to wallow in it for the past decade, with no real external help. My family are wonderful enablers but had no idea what to do with me. They made me comfortable until either my problems magically resolved themselves or I died. Either would do. I'm in therapy, but and I'm wondering what even is the point of continuing.

Almost an entire decade lost. I've watched every hope and dream and interest I've had be eroded and stripped from me. I'm hopelessly behind my peers. I should be dead, because my life is irretrievable, and irrevocably fucked. I can't start from the bottom now, like some 18 year old, unless I want to be working until I'm 90. I'll never have a good career or even a decently paying job. No safety net. My life will be a long, steady slide into destitution until I freeze to death on the streets. I have a girlfriend who knows me and my story, and who understands and loves me in spite of it, but she lives 3,000 miles away, and it won't be long before she realizes the truth and ditches me for a more viable partner.

But I won't die today, because I'm too much of a coward. I'll spend today hoping for that out of control car, or a surprise brain hemorrhage. Anything to end the misery. I understand that life is struggle, but if it's only ever struggle, and that's all it will ever be, then what's the point? That's a rhetorical question. Anyway, I'm not in any danger, so don't worry. I'll just be roaming the streets, watching other people live their lives. Observing but never experiencing.

Thanks for reading."
977,Falling asleep alone,My ex loved having his head scratched/pet so I got in the habit of doing that as he fell asleep. It was calming for me too to and also helped me fall asleep. Now that he’s gone I just feel lonely all the time but the nighttime is the worst. I haven’t been sleeping well and it’s been negatively effecting every part of my life. I even found an old stuffed animal I had in the closet from years ago and tried petting that to help me fall asleep but it didn’t work and I felt pathetic. I’m not allowed a cat or dog where I live or else I’d get one in a heartbeat. I don’t know what to do and being depressed is made worse by not being able to sleep. All I want to do is sleep but I can’t.

979,My life is going DOWN AGAIN AND VERY FAST,"4 weeks. I when to a psychiatrist, I was working on my problems, it was going good. I wasn't sad for a while. And today it all goes to hell.

Just leave me the fuck alone and let me be happy you piece of shit"
980,The Broken Lighthouse,"Tired of being the one who cries, who sits there thinking of the what ifs as i look at your photos wondering if you even do the same, but a part of my mind knowing you don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Wondering if i ever at all cross your mind whilst you play your games, but in my head thinking you'll be thinking of someone else who's less trouble, cries less, needs/wants less.

&amp;#x200B;

Do they love you? Do they know you? Do they look at your eyes, your face, hear your voice and think its all pure heaven.. that your body is everything they could ever want and more?

&amp;#x200B;

Or are they an easy fuck.. do they say everything you want, do they feed your ego and labido enough that it doesn't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Do their words during lustful moments easily replace my words when we are both a mess watching tv, when we both smell, you have stubble and my hair is greasy.

&amp;#x200B;

Does their love for what you have to offer outweigh the love i have for your heart and very being?

&amp;#x200B;

Compliments from strangers always filled me with some form of self esteem, a little jolt of ego to keep me fighting through the self hate.. but only your words truly kept me floating in the storm, but i always wondered if my words ever did the same for you.

&amp;#x200B;

I imagine you don't need to float, you have your own ship, you sail around, theres conquests everywhere you look, some prettier, some smarter, some offer more in life with money and stability.. yet i float loyally by your ship, holding onto whatever i can.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes you give me your hand, you pull me aboard and amidst the storm i see salvation, i see hope and a new world..

&amp;#x200B;

Othertimes i float as you casually sail on by, losing me behind you whenever my pleas or cries seem childish and overbearing to you, when my heart shines that little too much and such a trivial thing means the world to me yet nothing to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Every waking breathe, every moment, every trivial thing were the things that kept me afloat, those little things you saw as nothing were everything to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Its tiring out here, in the cold.. its tiring trying to shine so brightly so you'll spot me like a lighthouse on the shore only for you to pass me by.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Did you find lighthouses that shon brighter? That beamed new adventures with untold fortunes?

&amp;#x200B;

Anywhere i would have followed you.

Did my light not shine bright enough?"
981,I’m 19 and I’m scared,"I’m a 19 yr old High School Graduate, that may seem good at first but I talk classes that limitted me to only a few things I could major in college, I wanted to major in History or Culinary Arts, I love history, to be honest, it’s the most fascinating thing to me, reading the endless and greatest story of mankind. Culinary Arts, it’s like making art that can make you healthy. But now here comes thrvtragedy of a degree in History and Culinary Arts. They’re soft majors, very few people want a guy who can know history or cook food in a proper career. I have the option of upgrading my Math courses through academic upgrading but that costs close to 2,800+ each course, a lot of money. What should I do? I can’t stop crying about my failures in High school, the fact I took it all for granted with no after plan. I wanna attend College but I wanna get a job where I can pay off my debt and communicate with people."
983,My depression crisis just started today,"The last few months I was dating a guy and it ended bad. I was still in love. Yesterday I told him I miss him so much and he told me he was dating another person. My heart just broke in two thousand pieces. I found the ig profile of his new dating and he was really romantic like he has never been with me. 

Right now i don't have a job, I have family problems, drug issues, my dog is really sick and now a broken heart. Everything just get worse this week. I don't have a penny to go to therapy and have a lot of issues rn. I don't know what to do."
984,Bullies,"Gonna keep this short. I just want to sleep and reset my head.

Came across a post about bullies and I just went nuts, going through posts on

* how some bullies apologized to their victims years later
* how some victims fought back and won 
* how some victims fought back and lost

while reading, this fucking noise just keeps growing in my head, saying that it's not fair and **my bullies** deserve to be punished.

I loathe them so much, it's 4am and I can't stop thinking about it.

Sigh. I need help. Wish they can just die in a freak accident and I can stop thinking about it."
985,I (42m) feel cooked for the first time in my life... I want to pack it all up and move or escape or something.,"Holidays, extended family issues, small town, shitty people, boring job, health, and weather are kicking my ass. 

My extended family doesn't talk to each other. I'm kind of whatever about this...  My wife's family has a lot of issues that we actively avoid avoid, too. In my family, there's my mom's husband who has spent the last thirty years of my life being a racist, homophobic xenophobe who spends family gatherings picking verbal fights with anyone who disagrees with him. Thing is, surprise, surprise, he's an idiot. I watched him argue that planes fly due to ground speed and not air speed... While humorous, if anyone dares to call him out our attempt to correct him, he'll go off on them and eventually kick them out. My wife and I are the only college graduates and to him, college equates to liberal. 

The part that depresses me is that we live in a fairly small town where everyone goes to visit their families and have a great time for most things but especially for the holidays. So, it's a choice to spend holidays fighting or holidays alone with just the four of us. Easy choice for my kids and wife but it still stings a little. 

Shitty people we can't avoid. Three years ago we had a new couple we were hanging out with that we became really close to. They were a lot of fun and we had a lot in common. Turns out, this guy was 38 going on 16. It was really weird to start to see this high school popularity thing happen with him. As I introduced him to people, he'd latch on to them. Eventually he started to create little rifts between friends that I'd had my entire life and me. When I found out, I talked with him, said my goodbyes, and that was that. Or so I thought. What he's been doing for the past three years is almost psycho-level stuff. He'd see us at a bar in town with person or couple X and within the month, he'd invite them to do something with them. At first we thought it was a fluke but it's all the time. We actually tested this with two close friends a month ago and as predicted, he did it. But the kicker is, he's fun. I'll totally give that to him. 

Then there's the pool of friends for where we live. Most of the people here grew up together or are related somehow. It's very cliqueish and nearly impossible to find really good friends. We have lots of friends but almost no one we'd consider close friends nearby. 

We stay because outta by far the best schools in the state - or at least very, very close to them. Also, I grew up here and know most of the school staff. I didn't have a great education because no one cared, I care about my kids and I'm going to make sure that they don't have to do what I did to get a good education or realize too late how important it is. We're here entirely for them now but fucking Hell I want to leave. 


My job is boring. I'm an engineer. I get most of my work done in about two days time then slack off the other three. I'm not proud but it is what it is. My company was recently bought by a huge company and the new upper management told me that there's a zero promotion strategy across the board and that all new management will come from outside to ""get fresh new ideas"". I'm one of about 300 engineers. But the pay is good and work life is great... Dead end job. Every year I build my resume into a tighter and tighter niche that no one will want. 

My wife is having a kidney transplant next month and while I'm all smiles, it's freaking me out inside. She has a unique situation (requires the most invasive surgery) that's going to take her at least four months to feel better and likely six until she feels fully recovered. I feel for her. 

To add to it all, it's currently 42-degrees, raining, and windy. Sun sets before I'm home and rises after I'm at work. Dark, gloomy, miserable. I dream of sunny beaches all day... 


This may not seem so bad and after what a lot of others post, I feel a bit selfish for even writing this, but Fuck it, I can't escape it...."
986,Depression is a never ending cycle of misery and hopelessness,It seems no matter how hard I try I can never escape this cycle. Every time I receive a little bit of hope it is quickly taken away. Is it possible to break the cycle?
987,Ever feel like this disorder has taken everything from you?,"You never have time to relax because in the back of your mind are all those things that need to get done

You never truly live in the moment because you’re constantly thinking about the future or the past

When things are going great you’re always thinking in the back of your mind that soon things will suck

When things aren’t going well your mind makes them seem 10 times worse than they actually are

When you try to recover with exercise meditation drugs etc nothing seems to work

When you try to look back in the past all you can remember are the negative experiences in your life and everything you have “lost.”

All those positives and good things in life are buried deep in your mind and can’t seem to surface

No matter the situation you always feel stressed, resentment and “done”

Your memory is a fraction of what it used to be, you are a shell of your former self and you’re burnt out from all the bull shit in life

Sometimes you want to just give up on everything but you know you can’t because you have people depending on your success

How you wish it to all be over but every day it’s a never ending loop of life destroying you

-My experience of this terrible illness"
988,im going to kill myself tonight,"i dont have anyone else i think i can tell, so im writing it here. for the past few weeks, i haven’t felt the same. i have depression so obviously things never feel right but normally i can get through it, normally i can still laugh and be happy and talk with people. but for the past few weeks, i have felt nothing. nothing makes sense anymore and it just feels like my world has collapsed into gray and more and more my suicidal thoughts have grown intensely. going home is like going to hell, my friends disregard me and leave me out constantly, and i got dumped on saturday and therefore i have no one left to live for. my family hates me and it would do them good for me to just be gone already. i haven’t done laundry in 3 months, just been rewearing dirty stained clothes. haven’t taken a shower in a week. but what can i do? im going to die so what’s the point, really? anyways, i don’t want to throw a pity party. i just want people to read this and understand where i’m coming from if anyone who actually does care seems to find this. i’m sorry but im just so tired."
989,School depression,"I've been gaining weight and losing sleep. My blood pressure is pretty high at 140/90. That is with an empty stomach. My diet isn't healthy because I feel hungry all the time. I wake up everyday with throbbing headaches and stomach pain, but my parents still force me to go to school. I hate everything about school. 

Its come to a point where I don't enjoy anything anymore.

 Anime is not fun for me anymore. That breaks my heart because I love anime very much. Video games are not fun anymore. Video games and anime is how I used to escape all the bullshit of the world. I've never thought I'd see the day when my greatest escapes are things I've come to grow bored of.

Guitar is no longer fun for me. I used to write songs for fun. I don't enjoy music anymore

Exercise is another thing I used to love. I come home so mentally drained just from existing. I remember talking to my counselor about what I do after school. I told her I exercise for 3 hours and then I go to bed. I love exercising very much and it's one of my escapes. My counselor had the nerve to tell me to cutback on the exercise so I can do my schoolwork. I can't function without exercise. Its something she doesn't and will never understand. 

I lost curiosity in almost everything. I used to study philosophy for fun, but since California high school thinks that's pointless, philosophy is no fun. Books are now just ink on a paper. I gave up on almost every pursuit. I wanted to be an engineer, but school seemed me too stupid and incapable of doing math. I wanted to pursue kinesiology, but school made biology so fucking boring. Science YouTube videos are no longer fun nor interesting because school made physics suck major ass. 

I'm stuck in a hole where the only escape is death.

Please help"
990,What to wish for Christmas?,"Hey, I don’t know if it is the right sub to ask this question. I‘m sorry if I’m wrong here. 

Christmas is one of this times I stuck in a depressive phase, cause I lost a very close friend a few days after Christmas 3 years ago (rest in peace my dear). It still hurts me a lot and I really suffer hard in this times. 

Now Christmas is coming and some persons of my family still asking about what I would be happy. I don’t know what to tell them. My only wish is to see my dear friend again. So I told them stuff like a special shampoo, toothbrush, hairbrush and some other easy things. They don’t seem to be happy with this answer, but I don’t know what to tell them. I already have enough useless stuff in my home. 10 piggy banks, 70 pairs of socks (or more, idk), and lots of other things. 

They don’t know how much I suffer and I don’t plan to tell them. They wouldn’t understand. My friend was just a dog. But I grow up with him, most of my life he was my only real friend, the only one I could trust and the only one of my family who didn’t gave me the feeling of being a complete loser. 

Sorry if this post is longer than I planned. But I needed to get it off my soul."
991,Why am I like this?,"I'll soon turn 22 and I just realized that I've been struggling with depression since I was 14, which is 1/3 of my life, and the only third I can even remember anyway. Except for some tolerable periods, I spent most of my time on this Earth not enjoying my existence at all. I don't even know why I feel this way, but I know I'm terrified of being like this for the rest of my life. 
My life is mediocre(in a good way): I have a supportive family, I have access to quality education, I'm in good health, I have a social life and I'm an average looking woman with an average intellect. I often wonder if my issues are made up, since I live in my head a lot. It feels as if I have all the resources to live a fullfilling life, but instead of being grateful for all I have, I've created a reality for myself in which I'm constantly suffering. 

There are days when I physically can't get out of bed. I feel less like a person the longer I isolate myself. I don't have any desire to do anything or to talk to anyone. I've stopped caring about anything or anyone, myself included. I used to be very empathetic and even in my worst moments, I knew I still carried some love in me. Now I feel absolutely nothing. The lack of love and compassion is what scares me the most. I'd call myself selfish, except I don't give a shit about me either. 

Another thing that terrifies me is that the past months are a blur. I'm starting to forget stuff, and the timeline for the things that I remember is messed up. I don't know if this happens because I can't focus properly or if it's an underlying issue. My memory used to be very good. 

Food is the only thing that gets me out of bed sometimes. For the past two weeks, I've been probably eating 3500+ calories each day. I'm afraid to even step on the scale. I abuse my body every day by eating way past hunger in order to feel some temporary relief, and the worst part is that I am aware how unhealthy this coping mechanism is, yet I can't stop. 

I've ignored the outside world for a bit, and by the time I'll be forced to step out again, I'm gonna be an anxious mess with absolutely no self esteem. 

Sometimes, at night, I get this rush to pull myself together, but it doesn't last very long. I wake up with no motivation, paralyzed by the fear that I'm wasting my youth. 

I don't know what the hell is wrong with me and what am I missing in order to be content. A purpose, maybe."
992,25 and living at home,"Like the title says I’m 25 and living at home....well technically I had to move back in with them. Trying not to have a mental break down thinking about it. A little about me I graduated college back in 2016 it was just an associate in business but I was happy nonetheless considering how hard school was for me. Though it took a while I managed to find a good sales job it was base plus commission.

I did that job for a few years but unfortunately last year the place I worked at went out of business so everyone was laid off. Luckily I had 40k saved up in my bank account just because I was smart enough to live as cheap as possible. Anyway during that period I couldn’t find another job, I submitted tons of applications, I went to temping agencies but each job I had through them was only temporary. I then came across an old acquaintance  who asked if I was interested in starting a business. I was very hesitant at first but after a couple months of thinking and some desperation I agreed and put up the money for it. 

Obviously that business failed and now I feel so stupid because it should have been common sense from the start going into a business with no prior knowledge about running one. I let my old business partner persuade me into something that I regret deeply. By the time we closed the place I had less than 2 grand left in my bank account. Even with cheap rent I knew it was only enough for a few months. And I couldn’t find another job within the first two months. Not only did I lose all that money but my girlfriend left me and called me a loser for it. It still hurts thinking about it. 

Now I’m back living at home depressed and anxious because I’m unsure about what to do next. I’m now doing gig work like Uber,lyft, and doordash, just to get some money coming in. And as mentioned earlier in the post, I’m starting to have a mental break down. Because I really don’t know what to do. I keep applying to new places and even with experience sometimes I feel like it’s because I don’t have a Bachelors which I can’t afford to go back to school because I honestly have no money. Ive been waking up with anxiety every morning the last few months. Right now I’m honestly just completely lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I don’t want to give up but It’s getting harder not to. 

Anybody in similar or past experiences? How did you overcome those dark times. Any advice is much appreciated, thank you."
993,Here's a new one - lost a friend because I DIDN'T want to talk about my depression,"People usually distance themselves from you when you talk about your depression.

A friend was offended I ""didnt feel comfortable enough to discuss"" my problems with her even though she knew I was having a hard time and distanced herself from me on purpose.

I never make someone open up more than they want to. I support the best I can with the information I have. 

For the record I have been an excellent friend to this person who had been very demanding of my time."
994,"Depression from shyness, bullying, loneliness","I'm 5'7, in my early 30s, and currently suffer alot from depression, shyness, and social anxiety. It's been said that having good friends is the key to happiness since we're social creatures. But I don't have *any* friends now and it's hard for me to have motivation to live because of this. It's been very difficult for me to make new friends as people my age are married, hangout with their same friends from college and high school, etc. Not to mention that my shyness and social anxiety seem to be due to all the bullying and ostracism I went through in school and in the workplace in my 20s. I've never even kissed a girl, let alone had a girlfriend

When I was younger, I was bullied alot in school and the workplace. I've never really gotten over it as even today I'm still shy and have social anxiety. Even in my 20s people would mock me for being quiet, not having friends, never having a girlfriend, etc. It really pisses me off when people are so ignorant and think bullying doesn't even exist after high school. I can't help but feel alot of anger that most people never experienced bullying, don't deal with depression, yet have the nerve to victim-blame those who suffered from it

I tried many things to boost my confidence and social anxiety: Toastmasters, jiu-jitsu, weightlifting, approaching 2000+ women, meditation, traveling to nearly 10 countries, learning a foreign language, playing sports. None of them have seemed to work other than offering maybe some short-term confidence boost. From approaching all those women, pretty much none of them led anywhere close to physical intimacy. I asked someone to observe my approaches and give brutally honest feedback, and he said I come across as too nice, shy, softspoken, and passive. He said a fair amount of girls seemed somewhat interested, but many of them would later tell me they had a boyfriend, makeup an excuse to not hangout with me, number flake, etc. He also told me it seemed more girls gave me harsher rejections by flatout ignoring me and being disgusted with me because I was so softspoken and shy

I would say the only thing that helped more than anything was living abroad for a few months because I got alot of attention from people there wanting to practice their English with me. I've looked into how I can live and work there, but it seems the only way it's possible is to take a massive paycut

I already have alot of positive beliefs about myself such as that I take good care of my finances (I have a 6-figure net worth and no debt), I have a decent job, I'm proactive, etc. Yet, that doesn't seem to help with my confidence, social anxiety, shyness, and anger at life for being the one guy who has gotten bullied so much and always struggled with making friends. Those positive things about myself mean nothing to most people as they tend to judge males on their height, how many friends they have, how outgoing they are, etc. Basically all the things I struggle with

Has anyone here dealt with this and gotten over it? What advice do you have?"

1000,"I just told my dad and brother that I wouldn’t kill myself, at least until after my parents die.","I told them on the car ride to work just now and now I’m at work, struggling not to cry. I feel incredibly sad and guilty for telling them this. I said “just don’t worry.” And my brother said “you might just be saying to not worry or thinking that but...” And my dad agreed. They seemed very worried and my brother was like “that’s tough to hear.” He said “so you wouldn’t want to devastate mom and dad but what about the rest of us” really meaning my siblings. All my life, I’ve felt like I wouldn’t be much of a loss, even though I know my family loves me. I just...I don’t know. I feel really guilty right now."
1001,I realized today that the idea people genuinely want me around is a concept I’ve never fully considered,"I’ve always felt kindness from others is either an obligation or simply based on the “fake” version of myself I try to present to protect my deeper thoughts and feelings.

So my perception is totally warped to fit this conclusion. People only try to include me because they feel obligated, this person wouldn’t like me if I really opened up, they must have some ulterior motive, etc.

I’ve pushed away friendships, potential relationships and so many opportunities to feel better because everything has to conform to this belief that nobody wants me around. It’s the reason I keep myself isolated. Because I don’t want to burden others with my presence.

I’ve really wasted so much of my life believing this shit."
1002,Depressed without knowing it?,"I think I have been depressed for a long time. about 5 years ago my freshman year of highschool I got bullied pretty badly and had to leave highschool and switch to online, then I went back to highschool and had trouble waking up in the morning dreading to go and id just not end up going and having huge fights with my family, I didnt really ever have a reason to go I just did not want to do anything, I had 0 motivation for anything in my life, Id miss days of school and only show up maybe twice a week, I eventually left for good and did online school and that went well, I still had motivation issues though. well I graduated with my diploma and im proud of myself for that, But I still have these issues of not wanting to do anything. Ive had 3 jobs and all of them have been ruined by this “depression” or whatever it is called. I am not lazy, I want to do things I just cant bring myself to it. I have a job right now where I can pick my schuedle which is probably not the best because I have not been showing up and its frustrating my boyfriend and family. I want to learn how to get out of this because it has seriously affected my life."
1003,I see the light again,"I haven’t been here in a while. This is my little update. I’m not depressed anymore and I don’t selfharm! It’s been tough but friends and family helped much. I just want everybody to know that it gets better, even tho when I didn’t feel good I didn’t belive when other people said that but it does. It’s hard and thats why u should get someone you trust and tell them even a little bit.  You guys saved me so many days when I was about to selfharm I came here instead and nobody would judge. I have even told my friends and they said that they had had their own issues and it would have been easier to talk whit them so we could have helped each other. It’s not easy but U ARE strong and U CAN get through  it.  Love u guys❤️"
1005,College is SHIT,"Seriously, I am paying out of my own DAMN pockets for these professors, yet they can be some of the most pretentious assholes on the planet. College is a choice that is mainly dictated by money, so unlike high school where I'm forced to attend and I am in no way contributing to the pay grade of the teachers, College is quite the opposite. I've reached out to a professor about my medication going wrong, me almost committing suicide and self-harming because of the fact that I probably do not only have depression but anxiety and DID as well as an incoming eating disorder on its way. I didn't ask you to give me an A or pass my class, I asked for you to just simply withdraw me so that I do not have to worry AT ALL about my fucking college GPA following me for LIFE when I finally decide to go back and handle my shit later on once I'm not contemplating killing myself every single damn day. But no, it's as if I'm asking them for the biggest illegal favor. I'm paying you, honey, that shit is going to fucking AFFECT ME, not you. You're not losing your degree, you're not going to get fired, you're not going to get in trouble for getting me a W for my shitty ass circumstances. I'm sorry I can't just be ""positive"" and not be ""depressed"". My mind is fucking killing me, and any moment now, I may fucking kill myself but no yeah, anybody can get depressed."
1007,Don't forget other people may not know,"I was just reading a post about isolation, and there is something we might forget sometimes, I did it before I lived it from the other side.

I used to isolate myself a lot and get mad if people like my mother or friends wanted to do stuff and got mad that I never wanted to, I hated how they would feel like I hated them when I just wanted to be alone.

It's important to know that sometimes people don't know what is going on with us, they dont know what we need or what we are going through, they just see what we show them and if we only show them that we never want anything to do with them they might think that we hate them or that we don't like them, sometimes it's ok for us to take a few minutes and tell them why we dissapear for days or why we dont talk to them and let them know in some way that we don't hate them.
I had an issue with a friend, from my point of view she didn't care about me, and after telling me that she wanted to end our friendship she ghosted me for a month, maybe she was just isolating herself but to me it felt as if she left forever and that I would never have closure , that she just ghosted me and left, we need to take in consideration how we make other people feel"
1008,What the fuck am i meant to put in my personal statement,"I have like two weeks to do my application and ive only just started, ive had months but i did what do best and just ignored it. Ive spent the last five years suffering really bad depression and anxiety and to top it off im autistic. I dont have any interests, i dont enjoy anything and havent for years. 

Ive barely been able to drag myself to school and even thats been minimal, im now in my third year of alevels cause i had to repeat the first. Ive got no friends either. 

I dont even know if i enjoy the subject im applying for but its the only thing im any good at and i dont hate it so thats something i suppose (its maths). And because of my crappy mental health ive never done anything in terms of extracurriculars. I have absolutely nothing to put in my personal statement and its fucking shit. Ive already spent the week wish i was dead cause of a major downturn in my mental health and this isnt helping"
1009,FUCKING FUCK THIS LIFE,"FUUUUUUUUCK I JUST CANT I 
FUCK.

1010,What's the point of living anyway?,"* 25
* In deep debt
* Lost job
* My mother hates me
* Didn't clean my room in a year
* Afraid to write code and failing project after project after trraumatic experience

What's the point of supporting this pile of living cells? I'm just a useless parasite."
1011,Venting,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I recently bought a lovely house by myself. I have an amazing, caring gf, who will be moving in with me after Christmas. 

I have a good paying job. Altho it can be very stressful for me. I feel like I have social anxiety sometimes, even though people think I’m “the fun of the party”

I have weight issues. I am a big drinker. 

Tonight I pretended to be ill so I didn’t have to go in. So I could sit alone all night and watch some movies and have a few beers and a pizza. 

I’m not expecting any help, because the answers are probably obvious. I need to start losing weight, and appreciate what I have. But you know, it’s never as easy as flicking a button."
1012,I don’t value my life a single bit.,"It’s a bit disturbing. I told someone I know this and they said it’s “not a healthy outlook”. Well, yeah. No shit. But something about the way they responded to all my shit with just a sentence had me think for a minute about it. 

I know I’m supposed to care but I don’t. I find myself only continuing to live for other people who will eventually die or stop caring as well and then I’ll just find someone to replace them, right? I can’t kill myself because then I’ll have people hating me for that, if I just die somewhere cause I made a dumb decision then they’ll mourn and not speak ill of the dead and just go on. 

I pour my heart out to everyone because it perpetually feels like I have nobody. And then later I feel guilty for it because now somebody has to live knowing my problems which shouldn’t even be in their mind in the first place.

If I looked myself I’d make a few people happy. I refuse to let them be so. But I don’t value this husk of a body and waste of a life at all. If I were to die today that would be it. That would be the end of everything for me. I would suffer no longer. But I could never do it to myself, or so I think. I just know that I’m tired of it. Of everything. And right now I feel so on edge it’s insane. 

Last night was a blessing. And if there’s a god out there, thanks. But I think we both know no miracle can fix this."
1013,Sitting at work on lunch wondering what is the point,"So I’ve been going through a lot this year. More than any year I’ve ever experienced, I’m only 23 granted, but still this shit is ridiculous. I’ve never even had a traffic ticket but I’m looking at 25 years in prison. I wasn’t trying to do anything wrong or hurt anyone, I just met a girl and we fell in love, moved in together and went on with our life. Well about half a year ago me and her went to the police station so she could file a report against one of her family members. He did a lot of sick shit and so I was proud of her doing this, finally getting justice for herself. Well the police needed to look through my phone for text messages between the two, it was on Snapchat so we used my phone to screenshot without him being notified, and me being a fucking idiot I just handed my phone over without a second thought. I’m not trying to do anything wrong I just want my girl to finally beat all this and be supportive! Well the police found pictures on my phone cause we had been living together for awhile and it’s 2019, who doesn’t get a little freaky with self expression? Well she was 2 months away from 18 and I didn’t even think it through that way. So I’m able to be with this girl, hell we’re MARRIED NOW, but as soon as a picture happened I’m a potential sex offender? Nothing, and I repeat NOTHING, happened to the man who deserved that label. I was arrested, went to court and I have a prelim coming up and we are all hoping this gets dropped and it won’t fuck with our life. I was trying to join the Air Force so that way we could have a good stable life but that all went to shit. Everything in my life spiraled our of control after that. I lost my job, it took me over 4 months to find a new one. No one wants to hire me because of my pending record and I owe my attorney a bunch of money. I got a job finally but it will still take awhile to save. On top of that we got robbed for 100 bucks the other day from a guy I used to call a friend. We used to be cool but I guess when he caught wind of my charges he switched up and now I’m a chomo who deserves to rot. I just want to live my life with my wife but all of this is so fucking much. We argue a lot because of all this extra tension in our relationship and because it’s so hard for me to keep going. To keep waking up living a “normal” life not knowing if I’m 2 months I’ll be behind a prison cell and never get to live a life with the love of my life."
1014,Depression and Anxiety,How long did it take you to overcome depression????
1015,I knew i should have killed myself months ago when i had the chance.,I still think i might. Bye.
1016,Again,"I cut again. I've been trying so hard not to since March but I just gave in. It was only one, it was enough to make me realise the mistake i was. Please I hope never do it again."
1017,Having such a hard time with Christmas!,"I usually don't post here but I'm stuck at work and feeling really down and need an outlet.  So the last year and a half has really been a nightmare for me.  I'm a 33 year old male, single, own my own home and car, have a good stable job, and friends galore.  It probably sounds like I have the perfect life (minus the single part) and no, I don't think I have a terrible life and know I am pretty lucky overall, but still struggling badly.  

I had weight loss surgery in Sept. 2017 and then got a promotion in April 2018 and felt on top of the world!  Then June of 2018 came along and I woke up one day with unbearable joint pain and inflammation in my left eye.  Went for testing and about a month later found out I had rheumatoid arthritis.    Also in June 2018, a good friend from college passed away suddenly from a brain aneurism.  Things were calm for a few months then more chaos:  one of my uncles passed and a month later, my sister got taken away from my mother because of my mom's alcoholism.  My sister is 30 but has down syndrome and is unable to care for herself.  I stepped up and took guardianship of her but my family is 3 hours away and I am unable to care for her by myself, so my aunt and cousin stepped up and said they would like her to live with them.  As devastated as I was I knew I made the right decision.  My mother hasn't been well for a long time and continues to decline, now she's spiraling out of control mentally (thinking alcoholic dementia but not sure) and physically.  It's sad because I grew up in a stable family with both parents and had a good childhood, but then my dad passed of cancer when I was 15 and my mom held it together the best she could but between that and other life events she never worked through, she turned to alcohol and it got out of control.

Then came 2019.  Things were calm for a few months, then I got a call in March that my uncle (married to my aunt that my sister is living with) killed himself by cutting his wrists.  Found out he had colon cancer and didn't want to go through chemo or suffer with it so he took himself out.  My aunt was obviously devastated and I think caring for my sister was the only thing that kept her going.  Then in June she dies suddenly of a massive heart attack and my cousin is left to care for my sister on her own.  I'm doing all I can to assist with finances and making sure they have all that they need and I visit them and check in frequently, and my sister seems to be doing well thank God.  In addition to this, I also had another aunt that died of lung cancer in April and a cousin that died of lung cancer (again) in June.

On top of dealing with all of this, I work full time at a job I hate and am trying to get another position but have been having no luck.  I've also finally accepted I was gay a little over a year ago and have been dating on and off during all of the events.  Slowly coming out to family and friends and so far they've been supportive, but not everyone knows yet.  But the dating world has really been getting down, so many superficial people on dating apps and it's hard to meet guys in my social circle.  I also live in suburbia and have to go one of the cities near me (closest one is Baltimore) to date, which isn't far but it makes it harder to meet people.  On top of that my depression over all of this is making harder to socialize, and now that the holidays are here it's even worse.  I usually love Christmas but I am not feeling it at all this year and wish it was over.

I feel like I'm doing the right things:  I exercise, try to get enough sleep, pray/meditate everyday, try to maintain a good work/life balance, and enjoy myself with friends and also by my house when I'm able by doing different activities with them or just relaxing.  I also go to counseling and a support group to deal with my mother's addiction, but none of it feels like enough right now...but I really don't know what more I can do!  I don't have enough time or money right now to take a vacation as much as I would love to get away...just feel like I'm stuck.  If anyone has any tips/advice on any of this stuff it would help but if not at least I got to vent and thanks for reading."
1019,"Ex[ 23 F ] destroyeed my life [ 25 M ] , thinking about suicide","Hello , me and my ex were in a relationship for 1.5 it was really lovely and respectful relationship till she changed in one day with out any specific reason.

I tried to so nc for 1 month and she didn't give a d** about me and was living her life to the fullest, after 1 month i lost it all and started begging to get her back , we have been on this for 1 month till we got back together.

After she took me back , she changed alot with the relationship doesn't answer my phone , doesn't want to meet , only talks to me while she has nothing to do , doesn't listen to me or about my life or plans.

After 2 months of this i told her if she doesn't love me she can leave and I promise her to never come back ( she didn't give an answer ) , we started arguing everyday because of her behavior and she always blame it about my personality while she is really doing things that hurt me .

She started to blame my personality, and once i hear her laughing with her friend about me , I don't know what she was doing all the time she was trying to make me look really bad and a psycho to her friends.

I have lost my dignity myself and even my respect to myself , i know i did it to myself , but i tried to end this relationship alot but when i do so she doesn't leave me alone to heal and I told her million times to leave me alone to heal if she doesn't want me but nothing changed . Unfortunately I became her doormat and im disgusted of myself .

Im an engineer and i have to do masters we both have thhe same major and in the same college, I have only 2 choices to go back and face her and her friends and be in the same college = every second with her and her friends or to lose my future and i know it's the worst thing i could do 

Tl;dr;  i lost my self and became a weak emotional man for my ex and became a joke to all the people who know me , im tired alot and i might lose my future because i can't really handle people joking on me in public , i know im pathetic and anyone reading this would feel disgusted but it happened and im dying everyday because of it , anyhelp would be really appreciated ."
1020,Joining in with football/soccer,"Hey guys, hope you're all well. I've been a bit low on social circle/friends for almost a decade now and i want to make a change - trouble is, obviously, some anxiety.

 I want to get involved with football/soccer, as it's regular exercise and a group of guys/girls that i will see on the regular and will expand and develop my social circle. However, what has been holding me back is that i feel i am not very good (yet) and want to get better - however its a catch 22. 

People kind of expect you to be good and nobody wants to be the weak link, the worst guy on the team, or the one that people don't want on their team. Whether people say anything or not, you kinda just feel it and i don't want that, which has put me off from going all these years.

Catch 22 - you need to be practice to get better, but when everyone else is better than you, it highlights that you are behind and so you feel like you're dragging everyone. 

Because sports are a competitive environment, and the reasons above, I kind of feel that people aren't particularly welcoming if you're not actually a good player.  Rather than be welcoming or friendly, I fear from previous experience that they will be judgmental and critical. 

Please help - i really want to get a social circle (as well as get better at a sport and get regular exercise). Anyone else been in a similar situation?"
1021,I have an avoidant attachment style as my coping mechanism and have boundaries,"A friend who seems to have a extreme anxious attachment style recently distanced herself from me because I did not want to talk about in depth about the ""hard time"" I was having.

So what? Support your friend regardless of the details. She knew I was struggling and made it about how it made her felt. That is my personal boundary and because she felt I ""was too uncomfortable"" to tell her the details of my ""hard time"" she took it personally.

I never make people open up or talk about things they dont want to. That's what my therapist is for.

Everything sucks and I've lost a friend not because I talked about my depression, but because I did not even though I was fine."
1022,Is this depression? I don’t really care about anything.,"I’ve been doing a lot immoral stuff and just going along with whatever lately because I don’t care about anything. I’m either sleeping or trying to occupy my mind in some unproductive way. Since I moved to a smaller area earlier this year, it has gotten considerably worse. 

I go through periods where I do care and try to do right by my loved ones. I even work out here and there. Then a month later, I’m the most pessimistic and lethargic human being. Work has a lot to do with it, but everyone else seems to cope. Something is wrong with me.

I’m always in a state of “there must be more to life than this,” which causes me to act rashly, in the moment. I take unnecessary risks that sometimes come back to haunt me. There’s always a build up of loneliness and anger until I do something foolish. I need help before I do something irreparable (right now, it’s just smoking or drinking too much, staying up all night when I have to work, trolling and talking to people I shouldn’t). Sometimes I get so frustrated I do some asshole thing just to break the monotony and I’m tired of living such a pathetic lifestyle. 

The best I can do is just go through whatever I have to go through, uncaring and more or less unfeeling (except when it comes to my dog). I gotta get this monkey off my back. 

Does this sound like depression? I’m either mentally ill in some form or just stupid - probably both."
1023,Can I?,Can I have faith my gf will come back??? I miss her. She's the only one I love. She's the only one that made me happy.
1024,I think I've given up,"I've struggled with depression for years. I've been put on all sorts of medications, had all sorts of help. Some of it does help short term, but most of it makes things worse in the long run. 

Besides, it doesn't matter if I feel better if I can't actually get anywhere in life. Can't get anywhere in life if you have no goals or enjoyment. Well, maybe that part is a lie. I do get enjoyment out of literally anything that makes me feel something. And I'm absolutely disgusted with that part of myself.

I'm tired of hearing and seeing people say they care. Maybe it's just the logical part of my depressed brain saying this, but why would they? I simply can't understand why people would actually care, and that makes it that much harder.

I've contemplated taking my life many times. Come close to doing it as well. The only reason I haven't is because of this nagging fear that maybe it won't end the pain. If no God exists, and I'll just become one with the void, that's fine. There's no pain, it's simply nothing. But, what if. What if there actually is something more, and all that awaits is hell and suffering. 

I'm a rather logical person, and it's an extremely irrational fear, but it's all I've got. But I'm not sure how much longer I'll last. I'm probably reaching my breaking point."
1025,I'm The Void,"My head is drowning in voices, they are all screaming so loud my head is going to explode. I feel coldness underneath my body, anger who likes to crawl out and tears at mine skin. Cirkels are under mine blue eyes while I'm fake smiling on the pictures for  social media. They don't notice, that I'm dissapearing. That I'm doing selfharm in every singel way. I want to be gone. I don't love myself, I hate being me. I disappoint everyone around me. I ruin everything I touch.  Maybey I'm not myself, maybey I'm just the void thats killing me inside."
1026,I feel like I'm already dead while I'm still alive...,"I'm really going under today. 2019 has been the worst year of my entire life bar none. Just terrible decision after terrible decision from me. The self-loathing I feel today is beyond words or description. I literally feel useless, like even if my parents said they would miss me if I killed myself I know they would be completely relieved because all I have ever been since the age of twelve is a completely lost cause, a shell of a human being. I don't care how excellent my academic performance was, I'm fucked up and I don't know if I'm going to make it anymore. I feel like a complete failure. I'm really struggling to stay sober because drugs are the only respite from a life I no longer want to live. My bachelors degree has given me nothing to work with in terms of a career, and my passion for writing itself is fading too. I feel like everything I've ever worked for mean't nothing and was a waste of time. I feel like my entire life is a waste and I should just end the misery now, not drag this hell on any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure I've been writing for twenty years but I have yet to publish anything, and as for selling myself my unending crippling depression and anhedonia are only getting worse. I have been trying to quit smoking weed for years and failing so miserably. Its my coping mechanism, my tool to sedate the overwhelming self-loathing and absolute apathy. It once inspired me and increased my creativity back in the Golden Days when I was a Weekend Warrior and actually had hope for myself in life. Now I have no hope at all. The world feels evil, and its made me feel evil. Like I'm weighted down by trauma that drove me to sins I may never erase. I feel pathetic, like if I died everyone would be so happy and relieved, like I'm a fucking nobody. Who could possibly love such a strung-out fat fucking piece of shit?! I cannot do anything productive because my brain screams insults at me every five seconds now. I work out, still can't find joy in my work yet. I meditate, I'm still consumed by PTSD that was never treated. Seven years of tough love rehabs when I was already suicidal have destroyed any confidence I ever had in myself. All my friends are living kickass lives and I'm a total fuckup. I wish I chose a different major. I wish my family never moved me away from Atlanta, the one and only place I was ever happy and felt like I mattered to people. Now I'm a destructive, hollow shell of a man and I want to die so badly. I cannot see the light, only darkness towering as a glacier over my soul, and I honestly don't know if I'm going to win the fight against my demons anymore, they feel omnipotent right now. For reasons beyond my understanding I don't want to give up, but I don't know how to live anymore. I want to find a partner, but if I die alone I won't complain due to years of addiction, nightmarish mental illnesses that were never treated and selfish decisions just to make the pain stop. It may be too late for me. I'm not giving up, but I don't know why anymore."
1027,How do I stop someone from cutting,"So I have some past history with this girl. We used to be together, but then she said she didn’t have time for a relationship. I was hurt quite a bit, but this isn’t about me. Recently, I’ve heard from someone she’s started cutting again. She’s had depression for a while, and is medicated for it, but I guess it’s not helping. Even if we don’t talk anymore, I still care about her and I want her to stop. What can I do to help her?"
1028,A Teen life,"My Mom's a Jerk, My Dad's alive and following behind her. My Older sister has felt the blow once before. And Now I am the one with issue's. My Grandma, friends and Dog are the only thing to help. When will it end and when will I feel free."
1029,I’m worthless,No one even cares about me anymore. I don’t think it would make a difference in anyone’s life I died.
1030,At a loss.,"I've gone through four medications the last year and I'm beginning to loose hope. I seem to have the most success with SNRIs but the physical side effects are much worse for me than SSRIs. But SSRIs tend to make my depression worse and give me that zombie feeling. 

My family doctor referred me to a psychologist but he can't prescribe medication anyway and is on vacation until halfway through next month. 

I had the most success but worse side effects with Effexor. Pristiq was ok but again the side effects were just too much. 

Also tried Citalopram (again) but it gave me that dark feeling where I just don't find happiness in anything, which is definitely not fair to my toddler. Prozac made me almost attempt suicide so my doctor told me to stop taking it.

My anxiety is so bad I feel like I'm just at this constant war with myself and my self esteem just doesn't exist. Then the depression is to the point where I just sit on the couch all day. If I don't have my son I'm in bed 100% of the time. I've felt this way since I was 13 and I just want to feel normal and be happy for my son."
1031,Tolvon,"So tonight im starting taking my anti-depressants which in my case is Tolvon since I have a hard time falling asleep, so I was wondering if someone here has any experience with it?"

1033,I’m tired of having my entire day ruined when one thing goes wrong,"I turn every little inconvenience into a huge deal. I feel like I can only be happy if my day is absolutely perfect, which rarely happens."
1034,I don’t want to wake up,"I can’t stop sobbing: I force myself to smile. I pray. I work. I lay down. I read. I eat. I sleep.

I don’t want to wake up in the mornings

Help me..."
1035,Other subtler signs of sadness,"Of course it might be a sign of depression when someone suddenly isolates themselves or drastically changes their sleeping pattern. 
Most articles that list „hidden“ or „subtle“ signs of depression have nothing to offer to someone who is even slightly familiar with the topic. So I was wondering whether there are any true hidden symptoms of depression or just some that are not often discussed. 
For example I always found it very interesting that depressed people can be more empathetic and caring towards others around them. For me personally I feel like it is because the happiness of others is the little they have got in life and they seek to preserve it. Making others laugh can give them validation or taking care of others can give them purpose."
1036,What to do when nothing makes you happy,"Have been depressed for quiet some time. Took depression med for two weeks and it messed me up even further so stopped. Saw counseling 3 times and called off thought i was better but in the end i just didn’t want any help. If i dont want to help myself, i dont think others can help.  During thanksgiving i went on a 4 days trip vacation w friends but nothing seen exciting and in the end i chose to part way my friends and walked back to hotel alone. If a vacation couldn’t even make me happy, i don’t know what will. Few days ago stabbed myself with a knife on the chest, but guess didnt have courage to use full force and came to realize i wouldnt die from stabbing on the chest, i guess im still scare of dying but enjoy self inflicted pain. What possibly a professional counselor help if one is almost to give up and lost curiousity in everything? I guess posting here is one way is my consciousness of wanting to hear what other have to say or if there are any help"
1037,how do you study when you are depressed?,"i feel so much behind my classmates,like alot,last week we had a quiz (organic chemistry) and somehow i managed to finish in top 10,but its getting harder and harder,i can't keep pulling an all nighter before quizzes,can someone give me some tips please?"
1038,Worth more dead than I am alive.,"TLDR: I've always struggled managing my finances and I'm constantly broke or overdrawn. I'm living paycheck to paycheck and on credit. I took $5,000 from my 401k just so I could get my car fixed and now I'm broke again.

I need a better-paying job, which is going to be difficult without any education, or a much cheaper apartment, which probably means living in a rougher area.

I have no business trying to meet people, make new friends, or even attempt to date again. I have nothing to offer. Given that my life insurance policy and remainder of my 401k should pay out, even if I kill myself, I may as well just name one of my parents as a beneficiary and bite the bullet.

I have no idea what I'm doing anymore and no amount of therapy and/or medication is going to help if I can't figure out what to do.

Merry god damn Christmas. 41 years of this bullshit is about all I care to deal with anymore."

I found this video helpful, and felt like this lady really understands depression and the effect it has on not being able to clean."
1040,birthday tomorrow and I feel like shit rn,"So I have my birthday tomorrow. I won't say that this year has been the worst, but over the last few  weeks, I have noticed that my behaviour and attitude towards life in general has worsened. I don't like this and I really hope I can turn over a new leaf tomorrow. I'm not sure if I'm really here for advice (although it is always appreciated) as much as I am for just ranting. To almost everyone in my life, I seem like a person who's doing well in general, and that cannot be further from the truth. But due to that idea, I don't feel like I can share this with any of them. And sometimes that loneliness causes overthinking and I can't help but dissect all my interactions and come to the conclusion that I could have handled them better. I just feel like I could have made a lot better choices.

I feel like in the past few weeks, my priorities have changed and not for the better. I feel like I'm chasing people instead of focusing on myself and my goals. I know it's not beneficial in the long term, but sometimes I feel so overwhelmed by being alone that I prefer having a shit conversation with some random person over healthily handling the situation. This has caused a lot of distraction for me, I have stopped being as concentrated on my work as I was before. I just want to go back to being an achiever. These next few months are very important for me, career-wise, if I work hard right now, I might get to go places. But I'm doing nothing, and I hate myself for that. I just hate myself in general right now. I feel like I have become a person that I would despise. I self-sabotage a lot. I pay more attention to drama around me and I waste my time having fights with my a-hole friend. I know I should be blocking out the toxicity but I give into it instead. I feel like I'm failing my parents and my family. Like I am wasting my time on Earth.

I just really, really hope that I don't carry this with myself into the next year of my life. I feel like I have dreams that I would love to accomplish and I would love to see myself grow as a person. I'm really tired of being who I am right now.

I feel that this post is going to get lost in a sea of posts out there, and I'm okay with that, but incase anyone has read this full thing, thanks and sorry if this is too long and all over the place. I wanted to get this out. I'm starting again tomorrow, for what feels like the thousandth time, and I hope I can make it."
1041,I am so lost.,"I really don't know how to properly put into words how I feel. I really have felt terrible in this way for as long as I can remember, though it was only recently that I have been able to identify and address it as MDD. My life situation is very bad and its so hard to pull myself out when things are just so hard. So much harder than they should be, so much so that I start to wonder if I am even really supposed to be here to do anything. I never wanted to grow up and be like this.
When i was a kid I used to look forward to adulthood because I uad hoped that things would be better - but despite medication, therapy, journaling, cbt, etc... i just feel like absolute dog shit and it bleeds into the rest of my life (jobs, family, friends, relationships) making it even harder to help myself feel better because i just feel so shitty I can't even function properly around them.

I can tell people care about me and want to help but I can also see that everyone has their own life to live and taking the burden of helping me with mines is exausting and impossible. I pay every single cent I earn on gas or rent. I can't even use my old shitty laptop to try and perk myself up since I cant even afford a fucking charger. I live in a room for rent and im unemployed. I feel so useless and every day I just feel worse. 

Why should I continue to suffer this way? Why shouldn't i just find a gun and kill myself??? It's so painful to exist and I've been doing what im ""supposed to do"" yet i feel worse than before, but this time with less of a future to be hopeful for.

I probably will do it, sooner or later. I just hope that by then the people that care about me will have been far enough from me not to care as much as they would have before.

I remember how i used to enjoy things and people and have a personality.  Im just a husk now, leeching and wallowing in my own sorrow. 

Wake up every day, donate plasma, visit temp agencies, apply to jobs online, get denied and all plasma money goes to rent that I can hardly afford even then. 

I don't want to die but I feel like I am. 
I'm scared, i never wanted to feel this way yet I can see myself as just another name on another list for people ""taken too soon"". I'm just a failure."
1042,Shitty poetry,"'How do people know
Which thoughts to trust?

There are so many
Here within
That lie and trick
Twist and bend
Everything around me

They wink and smile
And then they say 
'Everything's gonna be alright 

Just stay with us
Don't let us go 
And you'll be safe
Safe from the entire world.'"
1043,What do I do,I feel like I need to vent and no-one would understand. The last time I came out and apologized for everything I got my ass beat by 6 pepole
1044,I got this message a few weeks ago and finally decided to reply.,"Really? Preying on depressed people for your company? seriously wtf

1045,Disappointment,"Well, I feel disappointed in myself, I took around 4-6 tylenol, just to not have to deal with my oh so *wonderful* mother because I cant even choose what's right or wrong any more. 

Cant even remember how many I took, but now, it feels.. pretty good if I'm being honest. I can feel my heart slowing down, and numbness settling in. Might do this more often."
1046,Success stories?,"This shit takes the enjoyment out of anything (and for me it’s mixed in with dis association disorders). Idk how many ppl who have successfully pulled through are still on this reddit. But if you are. I’d love to hear your story!x 

I need to read this shit to know I can do the same if ygm x"
1047,I'm having a breakdown,I think in having a breakdown. I fucking hate my life so much. I dont enjoy anything about it. I'm in so much goddamn pain. I dont know what I want to do and I dont want to do anything. I'm so scared

I will trust doctors again.

I will forgive the past.

I will do my best everyday.

I will fight.

I WILL beat depresssion"
1049,Seeking advice on sleep patterns.,"About 6 months ago I lost my closest best friend of ten years to suicide. It has thrown me into the darkest non-stop depression I have ever experienced. In addition to that, I had blood tests done at my primary care Dr’s office last week and she said my vitamin D levels are so low, they didn’t even register. They are “the lowest she has ever seen” so I just recently started taking vitamin D3 supplement to help with my depleted energy levels and overall fatigue. It hasn’t been sunny where I live in about 2 months, and in addition to that fact, I am self-employed and work from home so I don’t go outside nearly enough. Most of my work is online and I do a lot conferencing and calling, and since I would consider myself to be pretty extroverted, I feel incredibly isolated as of lately. The lack of real human contact and socializing is making the situation worse. Problem is, I can’t manage to bring myself out of my house enough to fix the issue. 

The past 6 months I haven’t really left my bed unless I’m going to my desk or to my couch. The point, and my question is, how do I get myself OUT OF BED or UP OFF OF MY COUCH to take care of my life? I used to be a type A, get-things-done early riser and now I fall asleep at 2 am, sleep until almost exactly noon every day, and I don’t start working until about three or four. Even on a day where I HAVE to be up by 6 or 7 or 8 for whatever reason, I will still stay up late and sleep until 12 the next day, lay in bed for an hour, then finally start moving around 1:30. I literally put my coffee pot on my nightstand next to my bed with the brew timer set to 9 am, hoping that would give me an incentive to roll over and wake myself up. Instead I roll back over and fall back asleep after it’s done brewing lol. I shut off alarms I’ve set, ignore any and all phone calls, and I close my pets out of my room so I don’t have to hear them squawk at me (awful, I know). I simply refuse to wake up at a decent time and I feel like I have no control over myself anymore. I’ve fallen behind on my bills, I have ZERO energy even after coffee, I’m LOSING money and I bought a house last year so I literally cannot afford to keep blowing off my responsibilities because I’m sad and tired. I have never been in this position and I’m scared and feel extremely alone. I don’t know if this is the right place to ask these questions or what I think I’m going to get out of this but I guess I’m just hoping to get some help or advice because screaming into the void isn’t working. How do I get myself up by at least 9 am with this crippling exhaustion and hurt? Thank you for any advice and replies."
1050,There are really people out here who still think mental illness isn't a thing.,"I saw a notification for a comment I received under this post of mine:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/ebi5lc/image_after_2_years_of_being_too_depressed_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

It said, ""depression is all in your head, stop being a pussy"". I didn't see if there was more to the comment or not because it was just the notification preview, and by the time I tapped the notification to see the actual comment, it had been deleted.

Like, yea, bud. And diabetes is all in your blood. What's your fucking point?

 I also received another comment under that post saying, ""Getting out of depression by painting Joker? Good luck"" in a condescending manner. That comment has also since been removed.

Fuck these kinds of close minded people. No insight, no personal experience with mental illness, yet they know everything about it and it's all fake? Ridiculous."
1051,Apathy?,"Hey y’all. 
So, I am just writing this out of concern. I am a bit, scared? 
I was at some point the most lively person I know, I demanded the room to be cheerful as possible when I was around. I was cheerful but I was still depressed even back then. 
Things didn’t go all sunshine and rainbow in my life, I always had some shitty fucked up thing up my alley. I lost count of the traumas, or they just became my norm. 
But I still had it in me to feel so much. 
Throughout the last two years, I started losing them gradually. Everyday, something stops hurting. 
Existence is pain, yes. 
Now, I can’t feel anything. I get yelled at, told to kill myself, I can’t feel. 
Someone told me they wanted to kill themselves, out of logic I stopped them but in me, I really didn’t give two shits if they live or die. 
Things that are traumatic happen, but I don’t seem to care. All feeling stopped. 
All I can do is stare blankly until it’s all over. 
Is this apathy?"
1052,Being alive is overrated. (Rant),"I know I'm not the only one. I don't want to kill myself. I just want to cease existing. I never asked for this. I'd rather be nothing than to feel nothing and being forced to stay alive.

I don't want my parents to be sad about my passing. Especially my mom would be devastated. She is such a sweet and loving being. She doesn't deserve to experience something traumatic like finding her son hanging from the ceiling. I just wish I was never born.

Fuck sugar coating the truth. Here's to another day of slowly fading away. 

I can't wait to die."
1053,I don't deserve anything,I don't deserve to live. I'm a horrible human. I can't do anything right. I can't behave normally. my mental state is fucked up. I constantly feel like shit. how to make myself behave like a human being?
1054,I want to do it tonight,I can't stop crying. I wish someone could help
1055,Anxiety is really shit,"It just fucks you over, for no reason. I had a decent day today, yet I'm sat at my desk procrastinating because I started thinking that all my friends hate me and that my best friend wants nothing to do with me. For absolutely no fucking reason. It's always there, even when things are slightly better. I'm sick and tired of this shit."
1056,It`s so lonely it hurts,"I have my finals very soon, and i just cant focus/study anymore i keep thinking about how lonely i am (I study abroad). My friends who I was close to during the semester are preoccupied with their girlfriends and exams and I feel sort of abandoned. I really dont want to fuck my finals up, but it hurts....."
1057,Odd cycles of medicating?,"Does anyone else stop taking their meds cause they feel fine? Like suddenly you just figure you’re fine and don’t need it. Rational thought knows that’s not true. But I stop taking it anyways (especially if I get busy) and then I tank. And start taking it again. 

I feel like I’ve been doing this since I was 16. Sometimes I can go years without being medicated. 

I’m also aware that It’s really not safe to just stop taking a medication. But my rational brain is not what’s controlling all of this."
1058,I AM A IDIOT AND NOW I JUST WANT TO END.,"Please someone help me, I am in tears and about to end my life. I got fooled by a friend I thought I made thinking he actually cared but didn't and then whilst arguing I forgot I left bath on and it leaked through and blee electrics. I am useless, will never have no one and cant take no more. I just got thrown out too so now got nothing apart from my phone. Please please someone help me."
1059,Mindfulness study needs participants!,"As part of my dissertation for my degree I will be carrying out research on perceptions surrounding mindfulness, as well as the effectiveness of mindfulness-based activities on body image. If you are aged 18 or over and a UK resident, I would like to invite you to participate. The study should take 15-30 minutes to complete and will ask you to complete 3 short questionnaire measures and a 5-10-minute-long video-guided mindfulness-based activity (an activity which involves cultivating a state of relaxation). Simply click the link to participate.  [https://leedsbeckettpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_abJWvRBnYY7IMVT](https://leedsbeckettpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_abJWvRBnYY7IMVT)"
1060,Just need a relief,"I felt even less energetic than usual today. So tired, bad, sick and just no will to do anything. I feel like everything I do there’s just no point in doing it. I just wanna fall asleep and never wake up again what even is the point in waking? 
Also I felt so fucking helpless: My depressed gf told me she is feeling real bad today and she got a trigger but couldn’t tell me why or what and just kept shutting me out. When she asked me how I was doing I felt like answering: WHAT DO YOU THINK IF I ALREADY FEEL LIKE SHIT AND THE PERSON I REALLY WANNA HELP SHUTS ME OUT?! Well I said: I’m fine"
1061,Validity of my depression,I have a diagnosis but the people around me like work wise doubt it to a point that it makes me feel as if it’s not real and it makes me feel like a bad person and or crazy
1062,The worst part about life is how much pain you can go through and still survive,"You just get more fucked up, more twisted with no sign of things getting better. Sure you may have screwed up, maybe even did something you know is wrong a long time ago, then your brain made that fucking synaptic path stronger and now it's basically subconscious and nearly impossible to change. I'm a terrible, lazy, pathological person with little chance of changing in my 30s. I just want this pain to kill me off"
1063,Life sucks,Life sucks
1064,Should I talk to my mom.,"So I used to be in an outpatient hospital. I needed inpatient at the time but my parents talked the doctor out of it. I got better for a few weeks. That's it. I really think I need to go back. I have urges to self harm everyday and I really want to die. I'm depressed it's hard to just be happy. I don't talk to my friends anymore, I spend more time asleep or mindlessly scrolling through tik toks than I do anything else. I really need to leave earth in my opinion. Should I talk to my mom about going back to the hospital. Or should I just go to therapy once a week like I used to. I'm not sure."
1065,Depression &amp; cognitive issues - any link?,"So to give some background I’m a 25 y/o guy and I’ve been suffering depression on and off for maybe 9 years-ish. I’ve explored different medication; Sertraline, Fluoxetine and what I’m currently on citalopram.

My main issues for those interested have been: low mood, low motivation, overeating used as a coping mechanism and extreme intrusive thoughts. This lead me to shut myself away and use games to escape.

Anyway onto my query! I’ve noticed over the last few years I’ve been having cognitive issues, I am slower at reading text. Slower to understand certain things that are being said to me, and I frequently have to ask people to repeat things. My memory has declined a lot and I often forget things very quickly. This has made me feel self-conscious about myself “do I have a low IQ?”, “Am I just ridiculously stupid?”, “it feels like I’m always the dumbest person in the room”. 

Is there any evidence to suggest that cognitive impairment is linked to depression &amp; mental health issues? - and will these issues improve once your health issues have resolved? 

TL;DR - is there any proven medical evidence that suggests a decline in cognitive ability is linked with depression?"
1066,how do you get out of bed when you don't have any reason to,I could get up for things like school or a dentist appointment but now I'm home on break and I just wake up with no energy at all and can't get up until well into the afternoon. I don't like living like this and I feel really lame and pitiful that I can't even get out of bed. I just wish I wasn't so useless
1067,Why,"So I’m a 16 y/o M. I don’t know why people act like depression doesn’t exist or that it makes you worthless. My parents don’t think that I have depression, they say it’s just a phase (I don’t think phases last 7 years) and so they refuse to get me help. Even though according to the professionals I’ve talked to off the record say that I’m near textbook. I’m just wondering is it my fault that I’m like this, is this a choice? Why don’t people understand? And I’ve had a shit experience with relationships. I’ve been in several abusive ones (physical and emotional) and many drugs were involved. I’ve been struggling to find even friendship, let alone companionship. Most of my GFs have left because I’m “a buzzkill”. Is that my fault? Can I change this? Is it better if I just stop trying? My GF just left me a few minutes ago for my friend, apparently they’ve been together for nearly all of our relationship. Is there a point? Why should I try? I can’t find any friends because they can’t stand how “cold” I feel. My friends tell me that I seem dead inside, and apparently it’s depressing. Why won’t this stop? Can it stop? Will it stop? I haven’t slept for the last 3 days because I just can’t. I feel like I’m about to go into a crying fit again. Will this ever stop? It feels like every time I try to take a step forward, I get thrown 8 steps back. All I want is for it to stop. I just want to find peace. I just want to be normal. I don’t want to die. I feel like I’m not gonna make it past 30. I’m scared. But being scared isn’t scary anymore. I’m having an emotional breakdown right now. I just want to start over. I just want to be normal. I just want to not be alone. Being alone is the one thing that scares me now."
1068,Probably getting kicked out of my university.,"I got put on academic probation and I'm pretty sure I failed a class due to this teacher having piss poor communication with me, and cancelling class 5 times.

I'm sad. I don't know what to do."
1069,Depression can hurt more than just you. Remember that. Please.,"So to be honest, I have definitely something else besides just depression. But, because of my own inaction to deal with my mental distress, and instead just allowing my self to be unfeeling and uncaring for the past few years I've caused the love of my life for the past 8 years so much more pain because of me being unloving. Uncaring. And more than a little selfish. Please. If your with someone, and you are having problems with depression, shove aside the classic ""it's not bad enough to get help"" and just find help. I still haven't been able to, but please. PLEASE don't let it slip by like I have. As of last night we are no longer together. I'm 26, we've been together since just before I turned 18. Everything hurts. Just don't allow depression to drown you in your own self pity, you'll unintentionally drag down the ones around you too.

Of course the argument can be made ""well your SO should've tried to understand."" She did. But everyone has their limits. We're adults, and I should've tried to fix myself sooner. But hindsight is 20/20 and it's easier said than done. But maybe this wouldn't be this way if I'd just owned up sooner and actually tried. Life is obviously more complicated than a single post can explain, but I could make excuses for days and days.

Just get well when you can."
1070,I’m in so much pain,"I’m depressed again, I’m taking medication but I still feel bad, I only slept 4 hours today, it’s 6:20 am and I don’t feel tired, I’m making pasta. I’m gonna watch Supernatural because I’m bored maybe I’ll listen to Seungyoun. His music helps me a lot, I don’t know what I’d do without him. To be honest I don’t what I’m living for, I’m living for Seungyoun stupid I know, but he’s like the only reason I have to keep living. I wish I could feel happy, I just feel numb, no emotion. I wanna cry so bad, but I can’t, I wanna die, I hate living, everyone says it’ll get better but when? I feel like it won’t"
1071,Failed 3 out of 4 of my classes this semester because of depression and anxiety.,"They were not even THAT hard and I was definitely not distracted by anything specific, I just really struggled to find motivation to actually sit down and study through all the content. 

A big part of all this pressure comes from my parents who are the most loving ones but really expect way too much from me, so I get physically sick and anxious whenever the thought of them being disappointed and sad crosses my mind because of all the support they give me throughout my entire life.

I changed degree on the 2nd year from a weird branch of Social Studies to Economics to improve my job opportunities in the future, but I still find it a bit difficult to see actual interest on my subjects. 

Do you have any tips, advice or comments so I can find this motivation/mental-stability again for the next semester?"
1072,This is painful,"I will be honest now

I have no friends. None.

People just dont like me. How is that possible that you somehow have/had friends? How you do that"
1073,I'm at that point where I'm not sure whether or not I'm just pretending or my mental health is pretty bad.,Just a constant thought running around my mind. Is it real? Am I just faking it? Or is the act too good to be fake?.....fuck
1074,I can't live because I can't live myself,"And I can never do what is necessary to change. I don't even think it's physically possible for me to think or feel any differently. And I can't see a doctor. I don't ever want to speak to another doctor. Just a garbage human looking at me like an animal in a cage, fishing for answers or signs indicating why I am this way. This whole life is a complete shitshow. I'm Virtually non-functional. I can never get my life together, because I will never have the happy and calm psyche needed to do that."
1075,I can live because I can never love myself,"And I can never do what is necessary to change. I don't even think it's physically possible for me to think or feel any differently. And I can't see a doctor. I don't ever want to speak to another doctor. Just a garbage human looking at me like an animal in a cage, fishing for answers or signs indicating why I am this way.

1076,i hate it,"i dont like spending time with my family i love them but i dont want sit with them why is it so hard to be around people today i was out of my room all day because the is work that needs to be done and building stuff and shit so i can stay up stairs the whole day while i was downstairs i hated every second of i just wanted to be on my my bed i feel like its my safe space and my isolating my self is really making my mom mad and idk what to do she just forces mr to out of the house have ""social life "" i just want to be left alone when i finally came back upstairs back to my bed i felt like i could breath again of how uncomfortable i was downstairs"
1077,Is it normal to lay in bed all day,"Over the past four years I have been quite depressed. Lately I feel slightly better though, lately as in the past week. I can get very depressed and suicidal and spend days and weeks in bed rotting. Occasionally I can come out of that funk tho. I don’t consider myself that depressed....just hormonal...? And fed up with life. 

But anyway, I tend to spend random days in bed when I have not much to do. Today I’ve been sleeping on and off all day and eaten like crap. I peeled myself off the bed 30 mins ago and I feel awful. Is this ok though? I don’t know how to stop? I consider myself lazy ???? Like I don’t have any hobbies, I’m not sure what else I’d do? I think I’m vitamin d deficient. 

Any feedback or insight would be appreciated. Thanks everyone"
1078,Mom struggling...what can I do for her for the holidays?,"Hello! 

Long story short my mother suffers from severe depression. Her apartment is a mess and nobody could feel calm in it, it’s been like that for years. She is always stressed, lonely, and anxious.  Last Christmas I bought her a yoga certificate because we used to go together and she loved it but I haven’t been able to get her to work out or do any physical activity even with that gift. It was $100 down the drain. This holiday season I was thinking of hiring a cleaning service to tidy up her apartment but I was wondering, what is something I could get or a service I could buy that would help her with her depression and well being for Christmas? What would you want to be given as help?"
1079,How can I get over the feeling of loneliness?,"At the end of the day, or in the morning when I am all to myself I get a constant feeling that I am alone, I have no one to stand by my side and I often cry when I think too much. I have no friends at all, none I could rely on."
1080,Does anyone else feel like they are just spoiled and ungrateful and not thankful for anything?,Am I depressed or am I just a huge piece of shit? Why can’t i just be thankful for what I have. Why do I always need more?
1081,Whats wrong with me,"Iv never actually posted anything like this online but thought id give it a go. Iv suffered from depression in some form since i was about 14-15 and it varies in its degrees. Lately it seems worst than ever and im truly bored of trying to stay positive. I feel like life has become so repetitive and i know the easy answer is to change my life up but thats easier said then done. I work a dead end job i hate and have no real qualifications. The only time i feel happy or empathy is when i smoke weed. I find it so hard to form real connections with people as i know this sounds weird to most but people just dont interest me and generally only interest me if they can offer me something or i can use them for something to benefit me.  Im basically just ranting and this prob makes no sense but i just wanted to vent to this space of nothingness on the internet thanks. 
To die would be an awfully great adventure x"
1083,Feeling of numbness,"Yesterday was the first time in a long time where I have felt like I don’t want to exist anymore. There was no real reason as to why, but I just woke up feeling this way and it has been lingering inside my mind since. It’s a numbing feeling nothing really excites me anymore I haven’t had a good laugh in forever. I keep trying to convince myself that things will get better, but I fail at seeing the bright side."
1084,Just a lil' bit lonely,"I don't have any friends. I don't like playing video games anymore. I'm about to be at college, and I have severe social anxiety.

I'm kinda sad. Thanks for reading."
1085,Lamictal for unipolar depression?,"Could anyone share their experience with taking Lamictal for unipolar depression? Does it help? What are side effects like? Any changes in thinking, cognition, emotions, etc...  Would you recommend it?"
1086,This sucks,"It’s been about 3,5 years since I last thought about what if I just wasn’t alive anymore and who would even miss me. 3,5 fucking years and this bitch of a stupid teacher managed to bring back these thoughts. Usually it doesn’t bother me much if I have a bad grade but this time I‘ve been sad, depressed and angry since we wrote the exam. I just want school to be over... I hate every single minute in this hell. I don’t have any energy after school, I just sleep in the afternoon since I don’t have much friends, not much hobbies and no motivation for staying awake..."
1087,Sleep more than 12 hours a day,Still feel exhausted
1088,I feel so weak that I want to give up on my dissertation and university life,"I’m in my final year of my Accountancy Degree and I feel so overwhelmed by all of it. I necer thought I would end up at a university, nor has anyone in my family been. I’m the first and I’ll be lucky if I ever graduate. My dissertation is proving to be the hardest challenge I am facing yet and my depression and vicious self doubt and only making it harder to even drag myself out of bed. 

Whenever I begin to study I feel overwhelmed and feel as if I’m drowning. For 3 days last week I was sick every morning because of how anxious and stressed I was. I can’t relax, I can’t think about anything else. It’s beginning to eat away at my being. I want nothing more than go take time to work on myself and build my self esteem from the pathetic excuse it is now but I dont have time. My deadlines are strangling me.

I feel like talking to my friends does nothing to quell my fears. I keep telling myself that this is all my own fault. My own inability to solve problems. I don’t deserve my degree when so many others have helped to push me through it."
1089,Wish me luck guys,"I am going to find this so hard to do and I might still back out of it but if I don't it means 1 step to getting better but anyway I'm going to show my aunt this letter over message I can trust her to understand me more then anyone else but here's the letter please let me know if I should show her or am I being stupid:




I'm admiting it to you and to myself finally. I am depressed. I hate the way I am. I can't describe how I'm feeling and I know your thinking why couldn't you just tell us how your feeling and god I wish I could I want to but the words just won't Come out my mouth because if they do it means I'm admiting that I'm not fine when I've been telling you all that I am when in reality I'm not. I feel like a failure to you all. There's something I've kept to myself for years and years and it's not something I want to admit and it's not something I'm proud to admit but I used to self harm in secondary school not enough to leave scars but it was something to counter the pain I was feeling from having to go to school and endure the bullying itd leave red marks but disappear within 3 days id do it on my thigh so I'td be easier to hide. Sometimes to this day I still have thoughts of self harm. I'm a failure at life. I'm to scared to get a job because I'm afraid of talking to people. Another thing I've got to admit to.... Some days I'd miss uni lessons because I just didn't have the mental or physical energy to get out the bed and most of my day I'd be sleeping. I know I shouldn't feel this way because I know I'm loved and I'm selfish for feeling like this and Im sorry I do I'm sorry I'm not perfect I'm sorry I can't be the best daughter the best sister the best girlfriend. I'm scared. Sometimes I have a really big urge to run away. My mind is a horrible place to be it tells me I'm a failure it tells me I'm stupid and it tells me I have no right to be loved. It stops me from sleeping or it can make me oversleep. I've started eating less because I'm just not hungry anymore. I say I'm fine so you don't worry about me and so you Dont ask what's wrong because I can't explain it but I'm not fine it's just easier for me to say I am. Sometimes I scratch myself to stop the urges I get to hurt myself. I love you all please don't hate me. I know on the outside I seem fine but that's because I've mastered the art of hiding my true feelings and only letting them out when I'm on my own in my room and silintly crying. I'm going to admit I just want to get away for awhile because I want to get better I don't want to feel scared of my mind I want to feel normal. I want to feel how I felt in college that's the most normal and happiest I felt  but I don't feel like that anymore I love you all I really really do but I just want to get rid of the pain I feel. I'm also going to admit that I want to stay in a mental health hospital or something for a while but I'm scared that if I do yous won't love me anymore that's what my mind is telling me and it scares me because I don't want to lose anyone of you am I being stupid? Will you be there when I get out if I do go to a hospital will you all still love me. I'm scared because I know if I didn't have any of you in my life I don't know where I'd be well I do but I'm scared to  say it and you lot are the only ones I truly love I don't even love myself. I feel so pathetic and horrible for feeling like this. I feel sick just from having a sip of coffee now wow. I just want these thoughts to stop. Now there telling me I'm pathetic and worthless and I need to lose weight. I just want to escape my mind. I say I'm okay but I'm not all I want to do is sleep. And again I know you must be thinking when did this all start you must know when you started feeling like this and the truth is I don't remember because now it just feels normal for me to feel like this as if I've lived with it all my life. You must also be wondering why I'm just opening up now and it's because I'm sick and tired of feeling like this feeling scared. I myself only truly knew I wanted help when I had a breakdown on a bus because someone kept staring at me now I'm not a violent person but I had this big urge to get up and punch this guy and I could just feel him staring at me and in my mind I was just imagining punching him and I managed to move myself to the back of the bus but my anxiety caused me to have a meltdown I found it hard to breath I thought I was going to pass out I felt physically sick I had to get off the bus way before my stop and even then it took me abit longer to calm down I lost all sense of awness because when I fully came back I was walking tp the car and I didn't even realise there was a step down off the curb until I nearly fell that's when I realised there was a curb during my anxiety attack I also lost feeling in my hands I couldnt tell what was hot and what was not it wasnt until the next day that I felt fully fine and this was all caused by someone simply looking at me constantly and that was the day I knew I needed help"
1090,I still cant get over her,"You were the best thing that had ever happened to me and I fucked everything up. I could have been happy, could have been on a good path to get my engineering degree, could have had friends that actually care about me. But I fucked up. My grades started slipping, i started spending all of my time with you. I was falling deep into a depression but only you kept me going. I wanted to give you the world, spoil you make you laugh. But all I could think about was failing school. So much that i began to believe i was a failure. I flunk out and get kicked out of college.  But you stay. You stole amy friends. Fucked all my friends. And I just stay in my room depressed jealous of you. To think you’re living the life I should have. I see you with your friends on insta laughing like we used to. But i haven’t laughed like that. I haven’t been able to be happy like that. You broke me and I had to pick up the pieces, but i lost some of them. My ability to love, to care, to be intimate. I trusted you with everything and you just stomped it into the ground. Now im left alone everyday damaged and trying to find happiness. But i don’t think ill ever find my happiness because I left it all with you."
1091,Depressed or just a lazy piece of shit?," How did you convince yourself that you need help? 

I have become extremely good at telling myself that it's all my fault in the last 5 years and that I don't deserve help if I can't drag myself out of that mess first. 
How the fuck can I know if I'm depressed or just a lazy asshole?"
1092,Its like ping pong,"I have been concerned over the last few months that I may have PDD. The mornings are always rough and hard, but at school, i feel ok. Im tired as heck, unmotivated and cant really concentrate, but I can still laugh and feel happy for a short duration. I never was long term happy. Is it normal? Also, at home, I am always on media, often watching a video while gaming. I never learn, do homework and rarely do work. But whenever I take the time and think about myself, the less and less I feel ""OK"".  In those moments I am pretty sure there is something wrong, but I am too ashamed to tell anyone, and when its a new day, I think I exaggerated and only pretend I feel bad and there is just something fundamentally wrong. Why am I always doing this?"
1093,"Lost my job, and my boyfriend just walked out... What next?!?!","I lost my job earlier this week, which was good for my mental health, but not for me financially. I'm glad I lost my job and I no longer have to work in an environment Full of bullies, unethical practices, and micromanaging. Only problem is I don't have any money saved up or another job lined up. That's not a huge problem, I can go find another job, it hasn't even been a full week of no job!
But since I've lost my job my depression has been a bit overwhelming for me and I haven't been productive with all this time on my hands. BUT it hasn't even been a full week since I lost my job...

Then last night my boyfriend and I got into an argument... I think it started because I asked him if he was going to come to bed... Well things escalated to where he packed up his clothes and left. Idk if he has left for good or is coming back?

All of this is stressing me out and my depression is just taking over more and more. I really don't see a light at the end of this tunnel and I honestly wish I weren't alive anymore.
I really really wish I weren't alive."
1094,The husk of Christmas makes me feel sick.,"I just went into a shop looking to buy some orange juice.

It felt like hundreds of people, all stressed, trying to buy shit for people they barely ever care about. Christmas is all about buying shit you - or anyone else - don't need. Whatever spirit or message Christmas may have once had has been drowned out by consumerism and the need to BUY BUY BUY. It makes me wanna fucking kill myself.

God, I'm so angry."
1095,I don't know how to be anymore,"I am usually really nice - the ""too nice"" type. I don't like conflict and being nice is normal to me, thinking people would do the same for me cuz it's just normal. Also I would try to understand friends who'd be kinda rude to me instead of just tell them to fuck off when they go too far. I couldn't and still can't really. 
I thought it would go each way but apparently not, especially with friends and family. I got easily stepped on, and used.

Now that I am not that naively nice, and having a voice and saying ""no"", I am stepped on in a way where friends now consider I am a bitch when I say what I think (I always try to say things in a soft and kind way because I really can't bear conflict, I'll snap if they are being jerks for too long). Close friends won't talk to me for the moment for unknown reasons.

I don't know how and who to fucking be. I can either be a carpet and be used and stepped on by close people.
Or I can step up for myself and lose people I care about.

I am tired of not knowing how to behave with some people."
1096,What now?,"I’ve been quiet about my suicidal thoughts for a couple of months, but last night I told my partner. It was hard, he was angry and hurt at my distorted thinking. I thought just telling someone, letting someone in was going to be the hard part but now I realize that being honest doesn’t equate to being better. I’m still stuck here with these thoughts and feelings, the only difference is now he knows. 

I was on medication for a few years until I went off of them in August. Everything seemed fine. I could actually *feel* my feelings and I became more present. Until I started disassociating again. Until I started to nosedive. 

I don’t want to go back on medication but maybe I need to. My long term relationship relies on my emotional stability and I don’t know if I can provide that on my own. I already heavily rely on his emotional support; my high and lows are draining him. 

So, internet, I’m stuck in limbo between still really wanting to kill myself and wondering what the fuck I’m supposed to be doing with these feelings if I am to stay alive. My next therapy appointment is in 6 days. What am I supposed to do until then? Should I call a doctor? Should I just keep trying to be better even though it feels like there’s no point? Should I distance myself from my partner to protect his feelings? Am I making the wrong decision by staying alive? 

Please help."
1097,I feel like my Dissertation is going to finish me,"So I’m in the final year of my degree and I have a dissertation to complete. But I feel so out of my depth and overwhelmed with everything I have to do. I don’t feel intelligent or capable enough to complete my work to the deadlines. I’ve been so worried that some mornings I’m physically sick 2 or 3 times and o still feel like a waste of space afterward. 

I’ve sent an email to my supervisor and personal tutor and I’m waiting on the reply but I don’t see how anyone can help me but myself and I don’t think I can. I’m not strong enough to force myself through it. I don’t know what I’m scared of, maybe it’s failure, maybe it’s being on my own through all of this. The fact that my degree hinges on this is a crushing sense of pressure. 

I can’t relax, I can’t think of anything else, it’s wasting away at my being."
1098,We are some of the strongest,"Our depression makes us stronger than most. We have to live with a weight that no one else has to. Something eating away at our mind. True strength is not how much you can lift but your ability to keep going when the going gets tough.

Now you may feel weak because you cry, or your at this point. But it's not because you are weak but because you have been strong for to long with out help. It takes a great amount of strength to keep fighting this. 

You may call yourself a coward for not killing yourself. No that makes you brave and strong because you keep fighting. Even the ones who lost their fight are still strong as they fought as long as they could.

 They aren't cowards or selfish for taking their own life, they were strong for far to long without any help fighting. What is selfish and cowardly are the people who put them in the position. The ones who make us feel worthless are the weak ones and cowards not us.

Now suicide is never the answer even though it may seem it. Even when you get knocked down you gotta get back up and keep fighting. No matter what we gotta fight the lies depression tell us, no matter how true them may seem.

I can't tell you when it will get better, or if it will ever get better. But you have got to keep fighting in hopes that one day it will get better. That you will crawl out of this hole back into the light. 

I hope that you all get better someday soon. When things get rough, just remeber there is always someone you can talk to. If it's family, friends, a therapist or a random stranger on the internet, there is always someone you can talk to.

Some things that helped me with my depression a little are
Please Don't Kill Yourself by Clayton Jennings

Stay strong everyone"
1099,For anyone out there struggling...,"After being abuse when I was young, I have sense started journaling and thought someone out there might need to hear this ...

When it comes to something like abuse, you'll never get over those events. They will always be there in the back of my mind. What I do is keep that back there for myself. I learned to shut off your emotions in certain situations. I learned so many survival skills because you’re forced to in an accelerated environment. I mean, you must because you don’t know when you’ll have those events pop-up and when they do, it triggers those survival skills that you learned so young.  

I became mature in that sense more so than your peers and that advanced way of surviving seems incomprehensible to others. Which, as you develop into an adult, can seem like you are ahead of the curve in some sense. But then you see ALL the areas that others were able to develop while I was focusing on surviving. Which, for me, caused and causes a lot of anxiety.

It's a spin of the wheel for those emotions. I don’t know when it’s coming; if I am coming home from work, a friend’s house, the grocery store, picking up a family member or even putting my feet up on the couch for the night. It happens.

I will never get over the fact that a person who was supposed to make me feel safe and protected couldn't get over their own shit. They put it onto my shoulders without any say, and at such a young age, forced me to have an altered perspective on how to survive during your most vulnerable developmental years. No matter what moving forward, I know that I will have these invisible walls up when introduced to anything new and I am continuing to work out how to break those down.

I was an adult at a very young age. I knew how to read people and try to interpret their motives and underlying positioning. Before even saying hello when meeting someone, I had already sized them up and put my survival skills in place before shaking their hand. I’m supposed to feel safe in these situations. It's not normal to be worried about that kind of situation. It’s been a difficult journey bobbing and weaving with this internal battle, but I know it’s

I feel for this any other individual I see being abused in any medium. I MUST speak up. I will NOT allow that kind of behavior to continue in my presence. While I will never overcome the memories of abuse, I can move forward with these set of skills and use them for the better of our society. My colleagues, friends, and people who have helped mentor me have mentioned that these skills are at the top tier. So, it’s reinforcement that while the events of my youth were negative, I have a positive set of talents to compliment areas where I’m somewhat weaker. When I am putting my feet up on the couch and those events come up, knowing the positives that have come out of it lets me have peace.

I hope that for anyone who has gone through this or is going through this, can see that light in the darkness."
1100,Guy..i am so depressed and churning out scientific theories....pls help,"Guys i am so depressed and lonely and anxious.....i feel like i am trapped inside my mind...

But i am overthinking too much ...more specifically about the meaning of life....

In last 3 days i came to many conclusions and searched those conclusions on google and found there is already a theory or idea in philosophy or science.

I discovered nihilism, antinatalism, determinism, and postmodernism.... on my own ..and really learned how consciousness really works.....all these are really pessimistic theories which also states my mental state.

I see humans as robots or ai or something.. like how you see machines is how i see real people.

I feel trapped inside my brain...guy pls reply i am desperate..."
1101,You Are Not Alone,"Looking back on my life the years that formed me seem to be, in most instances, a blur. Their significance blind to the hopeless soul I was back then. They were of the most influential moments of my life and yet they are the farthest from the reality in which I currently exist. Perhaps it is the loneliness I once found an uncomfortable comfort in that disallows the appreciation of a time in its absence. And so, it is the loneliness to which I cling. After all, for the majority of my life it was the only real constant I had ever known.

I have always considered myself to be broken and more importantly, that being broken was far from beautiful.  I have come to learn, I was extraordinarily wrong. The most beautiful people in this world are the broken, the wounded and the left behind. For so long, we just simply never had a voice. A sounding board on which to express that which is not modern opinion and/or comprehension.

We are all beautiful. Every scar is something we’ve overcome, a wound healed and perhaps a lesson learned. They should not be judged harshly, but rather celebrated as a triumph of strength and accomplishment. You’ve faced something, regardless of its intensity and you have overcame.

I am not of the masses, the typical or the usual. I do not fit within the confines of the realities of most. And so, for so long…I did not feel as though I would survive. I have spent my days living on the outskirts, never getting too close or letting anyone far enough in to see the damage I try so hard to hide.

And thus, I’ve struggled in this world to be anything but unusual. Fitting in was survival. Being part of the pack was what I thought would give my life meaning. A purpose in a world that seemed strange and overwhelming. And when I didn’t fit in as a *norma*l would, I found myself once again in a depressing spiral of discontent.

Over and over again, I found myself in the same downward spiral until it eventually became a comfort. I was so used to being in pain that the torment became my preservation. And thus each day became harder than the next.

Now, some would simply shrug this off as life. After all, we all have ups and downs, perhaps those who experience the feelings I described above are of the hyperbolic, melodramatic breed. And I’ll give you that there is always going to be a certain amount of crazy we just can’t account for. But what if in some cases it’s more than that?

How many of you know someone who suffers from depression? I mean really think about it. There are those that have life experiences that cause a low and an understandable spout of immense sadness, which is life.

But I would bet that almost every person reading this knows at least one person, for whom it goes beyond that. It is not something that is talked about enough. It is one of those subjects that can sometimes get dismissed as if it is a cop out for the weak. But it’s not.  It’s real. And it’s about time we remove the veil of shame attached to it and understand it for what it truly is.

Those who, for lack of a better word, suffer from this said affliction are not at all weak. Quite the opposite actually. They are the warriors.

They are the ones who wake each day with a mountain on their chest. Their heart as heavy as their mind, but still they find a way to rise. They push forward through the normal life struggles with an ocean of sadness on their back as if it is usual practice.

It’s different for everyone, but that is the best generalization I can muster.

Personally, my best explanation is that each day for me feels like a prison. I wake each morning, battling myself, pushing against a current of self-doubt and hesitancy as I rise to face the day. ‘I am not alone’ I tell myself and all be it true, I still have to force myself to believe it. Every morning, of every day, I have to fight, with the one person I should trust the most, myself.

Every affirmation of love brings a feeling of irrational inadequacy rooted in a childhood of indifference that I just can’t seem to escape.

It is in moments like this, those wee hours of the night, that it almost seems easier. Maybe it is because much of the world is asleep. Less of those to judge. Those who may never understand, just how vacant one can feel when faced with their own reflection.

I see so much of her in me, yet I’m not really sure I even know who that is. And therefore, sometimes, really most of the time, I’m still struggling to find myself amongst what seems like a life time of never knowing what was real.

I don’t know if I’ll ever figure it out. You know, genuinely find the solution to healing the misery of the past, but what I do know is…I’m not alone. And neither are [you](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)."
1102,i’ve been depressed since i was eight years old,"and because of asian culture, no one believes me. i was born with a silver spoon shoved in my fucking throat and that’s why people say i have nothing to be depressed about

i’m so fucking tired, man. i’m so tired and all i want to do is sleep forever and never fucking wake up"
1103,I don’t know if I hate my job because I’m depressed or if I’m depressed because I hate my job.,"I graduated college a year ago, I had a lease for the 6 months after my graduation so I stayed in town until it was up and I moved half way across the country to where some of my extended family lives to get a job in the industry I thought I wanted within two weeks. Its been 6 months now and I’m very depressed. I dread every morning, every call,  email, text, and meeting. I try to stay social and active in my free time but it feels like I have no free time and every good moment gets wiped away as soon as I clock in. I think its possible I’m feeling some post grad depression, I went from having an active social life, a team, a part time job I liked,  and lots of friends to having 4 friends, 3 of which I had before I moved and 2 of which are my cousins. I feel like I’m slacking at work and sometime the other shoe will drop and I’ll get fired and I’m kind of okay with that. My job has a never ending mountain of unpleasant tasks, unpleasant people, and just a todo list that never seems to get smaller. 
So many people assume I’m happy because I got a job right out of college and I seem to be adjusting to a new place but every day seems harder and more miserable than the last. I wish I had a week off or could get back on the anti depressants I was on (and hated) in high school. But I think I’m just hoping for a magic cure that doesn’t exist, I was still depressed all through high school, I just stopped being so suicidal.
Really I just feel ungrateful, I have a job I should love that others want and I just want to cry in my car and sleep all the time. 
It doesn’t help that my 3 months of training was actually 2.5 weeks and they just threw me out on my own to learn by fire. And when my morale was good I could shake off mistakes as lessons learned but I can’t seem to do that anymore, every mistake just piles on because I don’t know what I’m doing here and I think I have too many bad habits to recover."
1105,used to be the favourite child now i’m hated by everyone in my family,"a year ago i was a star lacrosse player with a really good job friends and succeeding in school with a bright future, my parents split up and they both stopped talking to me my mother gave my little sister my room and told me it would be better if i switched schools so i did then had no friends and my old ones forgot about me so i just dropped out with one year left stopped playing lacrosse and just smoke weed now and do nothing my mom bought me a car then after i got a speeding ticket let it sit in the driveway for months not letting me drive it then sold it when i could’ve been using it to find employment or go to school my old life was so great but i lashed out at my parents divorce by committing lots of crime and doing worse and worse drugs my reputation is ruined my life as a kid is basically over fuck it all i have a high paying job as a construction worker now and i wanna fucking die i wanted to be a lawyer now i do construction my mom has bought my sister 2 dogs and every time she gets her a dog they both want it to love more and just compete for there affection all day leaving me to be ignored i got fired from my dream job i’m dating a fucking whore and nobody loves me my life was given away to my sister who my parents used to tell me was a mistake"
1106,i feel i am losing myself cus of my bf," i feel too sad

i feel i want more love

i feel i miss my boyfriend

i feel so alone i feel like i have nothing enough

i feel i have 0 talent and nothing to do anything else in life i feel im stuck and cant help myself

but i feel he is cheating on me and some stuff he said he will talk to me sooner but he did not he left me 5 months ago same every month when he want somethign from me he take it then left me"
1107,"I used to think I was a ""high-functioning"" depressed person, but I think I've become a full-blown alcoholic","My drinking has gotten to a point where on a daily basis I get panic attacks when sober. I tried breathing exercises, I tried grounding exercises, but nothing works. It's especially bad at night when laying down in bed and as a result I can't sleep while sober anymore. I never had them before I got into heavy drinking either.  At that time I was just in a state where I alternated between mostly feeling nothing (but still okay enough to function) and states of extreme inner anger, which made me question if I was actually depressed in the first place. Hell, I still feel I'm just faking my depression for attention or that I could get over it easily if I just pulled myself together.

I can just barely function at my job at this point and don't do anything but drink when at home anymore. I actually cleaned out all the bottles I hid in my wardrobe this morning before heading off to work and was shocked at how much I've actually been drinking in the past two weeks. Half of the fucking wardrobe was filled with bottles. 

Today I thought I was gonna attempt to slowly reduce my alcohol intake, because I know that quitting cold turkey can be dangerous for alcoholics. I still had a nearly full bottle of liquor left today and told myself I was only gonna drink that and nothing more, but now that I'm drunk as shit again I know I'm going to head to either a nearby supermarket or to the liquor store around the block to get more in a short while. 

How do I quit this without having to go into full-on rehab? I really don't want to lose my job and I don't think I could just ask to be treated as sick for a few weeks/months just like that."
1108,My friend killed himself,"One of my good friends killed himself a few days ago, I'm numb. He had everything good job, a band he sung for and traveled with, great SO, and a good relationship with his family. I'm currently unemployed, legally homeless, have a tax lien against me that I can't get a straight answer from the IRS as to why so I can't even get a lease in my name. If he had everything I ever wanted but still ended his life what fucking hope is there for me to stick around."
1109,Tonight is the worst,"Been trying to tolerate this life for this long. To be honest I already planned to die before 30. It doesn't matter how I die tho. And I planned this when I was still a teenager. That was like 10-11 years ago. But then something happened and so I thought, perhaps somehow I can survive until after 30. But tonight depression hits me real hard. I feel pathetic and like completely piece of shit. I was never happy before this and always been wondering what is true happiness. I wondered if one day I could experience it. But perhaps not. I am too numb for that now. It would never happen. Sorry for sounding so negative but this is a reality which is happening to me. I no longer see any way to escape from this problem which would only continue to torment my life. Life sucks for people like us...

Also, sorry for my english"
1110,My family makes me feel so bad.,"Hello, I'm 15 years old boy and spanish, so if I write bad, you know why.
Anyway, i'm going to tell you why I'm depressed and if you have any recommendation I should know, please leave it on the comments. 
My family, in specific my sister.
She is 23 and she has been 3 years making me feel awful, stupid and useless.
When I fail in School, she laughs at me, she insults me and make me feel more pathetic.
But when I try to defend myself with words and without disrespecting her, my moms yells at me and my sister keeps laughing at me.
1 month ago, I've been in the bed without eating, talking or doing something usual in two days in a row. When I was at the bed, I wrote a letter saying all that happened to me, how I was feeling and asking for some help  to later give it to my mom because as I said before, I couldn't talk or say something. Well, she reads the letter and she does nothing and didn't talk with me about it.
So, my sister can insult, yell at me but i cannot respond without disrespecting her because ""I'm the little one and my opinion doesn't count"".
And the final point, my father.
When I said to he that I fell at 4 subject at the second semeter, he yells at me saying ""you are a piece of trash, you are useless, go to your room, i don't want to see your face, trash"".
But when my sister falls at ALL the subjects at the college, she cries and my father says ""don't worry is ok"".
So you yell at me because i fell at 4 subjects but my sister fells at all the subjects in a college that you are paying 400 euros (446$) for the registration of the college, more than 2000 euros in drive tests that always falls and you only say ""don't worry is ok"".

That sounds so surrealistic, but it's the truth.
I need help but as i said before, my parents don't pay attention to me.

Thanks to you for taking the time for read my situation."
1111,Mentall illness does not equal mental weakness,"Just remember: you've made it so far already, you're one of the strongest people i know!"
1112,Suicide Solution,"Listen here, I dont need you guys to tell me: ""Before you commit suicide read this"" or some lame ass stories about a girl who wanted to be a doctor and ended her life, whatever...
Please I need the simplest way to end my fucking life; trust me, I had enough and Im not gonna try anymore.
This shit is done.
Im done.
Can someone do me a favor and provide a good method, I wanna stop my soul from being hurt and thats all."
1113,Need Advice,"So i am in situation. I have been really depressed lately almost suicidal. And normally my coping method is to hop on my computer and play some video games. But the dilemma is that my parents both hate video games and my grades have been suffering as if late. So they dont want to ""reward"" me with time on the computer and instead they want me to do homework. What should I do? I dont want to tell them and have them get angry at me, but thats my release. If you have any advice it would be much appreciated."
1114,Experiences with drinking alcohol while on Wellbutrin (bupropion)/lexapro?,"Okay for starters i’m on 300 mg of Wellbutrin &amp; 20 mg of Lexapro. Last night I had a glass of wine and my face flushed after about 30 minutes of drinking it which I think was triggered by the interaction of my meds and alc. Obviously I was fine but I was surprised it happened that fast. 
Anyways, I am going out NYE and was wondering if I should stop taking it for a while or if it’s safe to drink while on it.  I am in remission for depression and anxiety so I don’t generally think I need it although I do have my moments. 
LMK what your experiences are"
1115,Extra hard to keep it together today. 😑,
1116,How can I feel better...,"
So I’m going to start this out by saying I have no been diagnosed. I’m not here to claim “hey I have depression” ect. and seem like an attention seeker. I was just wondering what helped you guys maybe get out of the hole you were in? I saw some post talking about people getting better and it gave me a little bit of hope for maybe feeling better in the future. Since middle school I haven’t been happy. Always unmotivated and tired with no energy and terrible sad(I don’t really know how to explain the feeling of it tbh). I hated my self so much, my body, my face, everything about me. And it just keeps getting so much worse. I’m a junior in highschool and it’s like I can never get a break. Just feel happy, hell even “meh”. It like I have weights on my shoulder and I cannot move them. And I just want to know how you guys maybe made yourself feel good? I just don’t know what to do anymore."
1117,I can’t stop crying,"I’ve never been diagnosed with depression, just ocd and anxiety. But I have absolutely 0 motivation to finish up the rest of my semester, but I’m pushing through as my last final is Friday. But I can’t stop crying, it’s like so random."
1118,I’ve been depressed recently,"It has to do a lot with my self insecurities, I don’t think I’m very attractive and I can’t tell if my partner is even attracted to me.  I need to talk to someone but I’m scared to talk to my partner rn about this"
1119,"As the end of the decade is approaching, how have the 2010's been for you?","For me, this decade has been a rollercoaster. For the first time I'm exposed to how the real world was like; I was nervous, overly excited, stubborn to get my hands on all possible experiences and then slowly becoming apathetic to most things. For the first half it was quite interesting, for the second half it was just me staying mostly at home trying to find any reasons not to go out socialising in fear of people seeing what's really inside me: nothingness. I still struggle to relate to people, struggle to find reasons to get out of bed every morning and struggle to find what I really enjoy dont because frankly speaking, I don't like doing anything at all. So here's to all the ups and downs of the 2010's, to all the people I've met who've taught me so much and to all the times I've caused my family misery because of my indecisiveness and unwillingness to do grasp onto reality. Dear the 2020's, I don't know what you have in store for me, and I don't ask for much; I just wish that maybe one day, I've be able to function like how a normal human being would. Thank you all for reading."
1120,I just wanted to tell someone how I am feeling.,"Hi Reddit. 

I am terribly depressed and have nobody to talk to. I have parents and sisters living in a different city, but they won't bother listening to me. They never did actually. Being an introvert is tough.  

I have been crying the whole day due to some traumatic flashbacks reminded by a recent incident. The reason for my mental trauma wasn't solved, rather I had to pretend as nothing happened for the last four years thanks to my never-trying-to-understand-me-family. Over those years, I had cried almost every night and pretended to be normal during the day. I had to go through a very difficult time because of that traumatic incident but somehow managed to stay optimistic about the future. Nothing remarkable was changed during those years of staying optimistic. But I had tried hard. I tried while I cried. Yet the fate never looked at me. I don't think I have much hope to fool myself to stay optimistic for long. I wish I could tell someone what I went through. That would leave me with a less heavy heart.

I just wanted to tell someone how I am feeling. I wish I had a shoulder to cry on."
1121,I have been blessed with a great life that I continuously waste because of who I am,"I hate to admit it but maybe writing it out will finally make me accept it. I have been provided loving parents and many great opportunities but I am genuinely am not capable of truly appreciating them because of my selfish and conceited nature combined with my lack of intelligence. Some may say simply acknowledging this is proof of me working towards fixing this, but writing down your flaws is one thing, and being able to truly accept that you have them is another. Not only this but due to my narcissistic tendencies I have a difficult time truly believing the harsh truth that I am talentless and not special/gifted at all. I always feel bad after I dissapoint my family and do not listen to them but I continue making the same mistakes because I am incapable of learning from them, again I suspect from my stupidity. I cannot continue living like this but I find myself unable to change, so I stay stuck like this, repeating these self destructive behaviours on a loop and my parents realise who I really am."
1122,Does certain music bring you back to a bad place?,"When I was super depressed and in a bad place I listened to a lot of Lil Peep lol, and random punk bands. But now that I'm feeling a bit better, when I listen to those artists it takes me right back to where I was back in the day. It's almost like going back in time. 

I guess it's just simple nostalgia but the emotions music can bring are so intense. It's almost like a form of self harm. Like ""I know listening to this stuff isn't good for me, but it feels so good to feel again."""
1123,"Depressed and afraid, but pretending you're not","This will probably seem like a rant . . .

Other adults don't understand or don't care how depressed you are. My depression and anxiety are out of control and this post is taking all the courage I can muster to type out. I've systematically alienated all my friends to the point I haven't seen them or even spoken to them in over 2 years. I've let a close coworker in on it slightly (who I've known over 10 years) but people just dont know what to say to you when a 34 year old tells them they're too scared to call a stranger on the phone.

I've tried therapy a few times but I don't get anything out of it, I'm too scared to try and reach out to people. I'm bitter and untrusting towards medical professionals too.  I get chronic migraines and am of a couple preventative medications for it (down to 2-3 headaches a week from 5+), my doctor asked if I'm stressed and his answer to my yes is ""Don't"".  That's always the answer, don't be sad, don't be scared, don't give up. I want to give up, I want to quit my job, I'm so sick of feeling afraid all the time. It's getting so hard maintaining this sham. 

The only advise I can give is always say yes when friends invite you to hang out or go somewhere, even if you feel like crap and just want time to yourself. They'll eventually stop calling and you'll miss them, horribly."
1124,Naively told my employer about my mental health problems. 2 days later they requested I become a contractor with half the pay or be terminated.,"Being a contractor isn't bad, but in this case it would cut my income in half. I even said to my boss, "" I think there is a taboo about this sort of thing in most businesses so I worry something negative will happen."" He assured me the company was ""different"" and now I have to either cut my income in half or be fired. The reward for me seeking help."
1125,"Does anyone else find it comforting that you could just, end it?","No matter how bad things get, I sometimes think to myself that if it ever gets worse I could always just end it. I’m not really suicidal, but that thought gives me enough comfort to bring me out of a thought-spiral or a panic attack. I hope I’m not alone in this. It’s worrying that this is what helps, but sometimes it feels like it’s all I have."
1126,It's back even worse,"A couple of weeks ago I posted about feeling better every day. Well, this lasted for about 2-3 weeks. Now my depression feels even worse than before. 

Does anyone can relate to this? Thinking it gets better, but then comming back even worse? 

It just feels like one step forward ends up in 20 steps back and I just don't know how to handle it. I'm at the point again where I stay in bed all day, even skip my classes. 

Now I feel stupid that it even crossed my mind that I felt better. 

Thought this was something to share with you guys and I'm curious if people can relate to this?"
1127,Almost 2 years together and he still doesn’t understand.,"Was feeling extremely terrible after work. Had to take my meds and everything. Wanted to talk to S/O badly because overwhelmed. Instead got a whole speech about how I need to ‘look at the positives’ and how he has a broken family with no money so I shouldn’t be depressed. All while I was downing a Lexapro pill.

Lovely."
1128,"Surviving, but not happy","Need to vent or share or whatever. I’ve been struggling for a while. I’m surviving. I’m on all the drugs for my anxiety and depression. I have a stressful job that gives me meaning but I’m done with it. No idea what to do if I quit it. I feel like I’m getting very little enjoyment from life. My marriage is suffering because of my mental health. I’ve become much more isolated the last couple of years. I’m so tired of this battle. But I’ll keep fighting and hope I find my happiness! Good luck with the holidays fam, rough time of year!"
1129,I'm stuck,"Hello, everyone. I had to write to someone about this.  
I feel so empty, and as if I'm not alive -- as if I'm in a spectator mode, hearing the words I say without realizing they're coming from me, watching my actions as if they're made without my thought. There's that feeling in my chest constantly, as if my heart's beating faster. All I can truly feel is regret, guilt, and hatred. I feel so much hatred towards myself for not being good enough or better for the people I care. All of this has been going around for 4 years. I've been cheated on multiple times during this first relationship, and I was never someone's first choice due to my average looks. The interests we shared, games we played, and my personality -- it didn't help. And I was really giving my all. I'm 21, and I'm at point where I don't know what to do. I should focus on my studies, but I feel like everyone's smarter than me and that they're taking it all seriously, as they should. I feel like I don't belong anywhere and that I should've never been alive. I know I'm blinded with these thoughts, but I'm constantly being reminded how worthless I am. Maybe it is the reality. I feel like I'm stuck, and the world just keeps on going.. and I'm just watching.   
I'm not saying this is all because of that relationship. It's just how, overall, things seem to be. Maybe I've set too big goals for myself, don't know. I really wish I could be of some use. I've been happy when I made other people happy, but now I'm just disappointing everyone. I've been trying to get back on my feet, but it hit me again today.   


I've been diagnozed with depression back in November last year, but I refused to take pills as I thought I'd get better. A psychologist told me that if I end up killing myself, she'll lose her job, and she told me that I should work much much harder. As much as I'd like to just vanish, I mustn't do it because of parents and my older brother. What should I do? Please help.

This is probably a big mess for you to read, so I'd like to apologize for that.   
Thank you, and sorry for taking your time."
1130,Does depression make you text less ?,"My bf is very depressed due to personal problems and keeps telling me how much he hates his life and is exhausted. I am really trying to be there for him but since he has reduced talking and sometimes ignores my messages I am taking it very personally. He said he doesn’t feel like talking everyday and it puts a pressure on him which he doesn’t want. 

But does depression make you not want to text and ignore messages from your girlfriend ? When I am sad or undergoing stress I feel like reaching out more"
1131,Does anyone feel like you’re slowing ticking away?,"It’s been a bit of an emotional roller coaster these past 4 years. I genuinely feel like I’ve forgotten how happiness feels, for an extended amount of time. My depression has significantly decreased since summer, for which I am truly thankful for. Yet everyday I fall into this dark place and then find myself feeling like I am a horrible person. I just feel so useless and unimportant to my peers, or even the world for that matter. I feel terrified of death and nearly drive myself crazy with these thoughts on the daily. I want to feel whole again, being a more wholesome, and productive person. I am only 16 years old, but I feel so drained and can’t even imagine how life is going to be for me as an adult."
1132,I'm Stuck,"I really don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore. I'm stuck in a really strange and shitty siituation- 19, trans, stuck in a household with unaccepting parents. I don't know what to do, I tried to come out to them but instead of even just not accepting it, they deny it. You're probably telling me in your head to just move out. That would be the solution, yes, except it's not that easy. My parents are unhappy together, but they're also unhappy themselves. I'm afraid if I do leave, this whole house is going to fall apart. I also have a lot of things here that I don't want to let go of, like my animals. I'm worried they won't get the same amount of love that I give them. The other thing is, I have nowhere to go. I don't have a license, a car or a job, and I don't have any friends to turn to. I don't even have a goal in mind, a drive to do anything with my life, I'm guessing because I can't even get past this. I should be able to do anything, I put so much work into the school and made it out with amazing grades, I've gotten into big colleges. But I don't really want to go to college, I have no interest in getting a degree in something. Maybe its because I just have so much pressure on me. I'm supposed to be some child prodigy doing big things in life, that's what my friends, family and teachers expected. But honestly? I can barely make it out of bed most days. I don't really feel anything except guilt and self hated anymore. Paet of me is anxious to do something, anything, but at the end of the day, I can barely breathe."
1133,Trying to keep my head up.,"After a couple of weeks off I returned to work. The first week was alright I started to get back to a flow, a routine and looking after myself but instead of keeping my head down and try to get on with my day I decided to pipe up about something at work to the boss which got ignored hard and then I tried to interact with coworkers which again didn't go down well.

 It's small but these things will be in my head for awhile. I know I shouldn't fall back but it's very easy too."
1134,Life is meaningless and I hate money and people,"I went to see a psychotherapist today. Turned out that the prices on the website were wrong, and instead of charging me 77$ administrators tried to charge 217$. I wished them good luck with their clients and walked away. 

But my problems are still with me, hooray! 

It’s been almost 5 years since I admitted to myself that life has no meaning. I’ve been trying REALLY HARD to enjoy my life nevertheless. But recently I’ve started to fail miserably.

There are only few things that make me happy: being in nature, drawing and spending time with close ones. Two years ago I moved to a big city and now have no chance to actually spend some time being alone in the field or in the woods. Also — for the past two years I’ve been drawing some stuff for a bunch of marketing vampires and different brands, and I’m SO FUCKING TIRED of it. I can’t draw anymore, even for myself. So, there’s only one thing left to enjoy my life: people I love. 

But, I guess, this isn’t enough for me to overcome my existential crisis. I want my life to mean at least something FOR ME. I want to do things I want to do. 

The whole concept of humanity as a civilization kills me. I hate people, I hate their nature, I hate what they’ve done with the planet, I hate almost everyone for being too dumb to comprehend the fact that we’re fucking monkeys on a flying rock, and there will never be anything else. 

I hate the concept of money. I was earning quite a lot when I was drawing for marketing. But it didn’t give me anything, I was spending my income on gifts for my loved ones and for charity. I tried buying myself things I used to DREAM of. They didn’t add value to anything In my life. 

I’m completely clueless about what to do with my life now. I just want to stop existing. I’m too dumb to work on something great — something that I’ll be proud of. Making cool shows, animated movies, games, space rockets, etc. 

Everything is disappointing."
1135,When you think the end of the semester and time off from work will help,I had hope that somehow getting away from the stress would get rid of my depression although it’s never been like that. I’m in NYC on vacation and thought I could temporarily escape the emptiness but I just thought about dying the whole train ride.
1136,Being the single friend,"I’m not saying I’m depressed because I’m single or anything. But I feel as though no one will ever want me, I’m just that undesirable. Ofc I have great friends, they hype me up and say “the guys at this school are stupid to not realize your value” but I’m just like no, it’s just me they probably can sense my sadness a Mile away plus I have acne.  Ugh life is great life is great."
1137,Roots by In This Moment,"You wanna know why I like the pain you say

There’s some sick part of me thankful for the hate

I stay positive and I push forward ya see

I gotta do the right thing for my family

So I smile and I say that the world is just fine

As these fucking parasites eat up my spine

So I ask you once and I ask you again

Where do your roots start and where do your roots end

This is exactly what it's like to live with dysthymia."
1138,I'm scared of being home,"I don't like being in my house and I'm now scared of being there. I've been feeling worse than usual lately and it feels like, when I'm home, the whole thing just gets 10 times worse. All the thoughts are harsher, the screaming in my head feels louder. It all just feels so much worse and so much louder than it does when I'm outside.

And at least outside I don't have a way to hurt myself. Because when things get too loud I usually end up hurting myself. And that adds to the fear. I've already cut so much the past few days and I'm scared of doing it more, doing it deeper. It won't reach that point where I'm trying to do it to kill myself, but it can still get pretty bad. 

The thing is though, I have nothing to do outside. Only walk around town, maybe go to stores, but that's it. And I can only do that for so long before I have to go back home again..."
1139,24m looking for friends,"I don't know if this is the place for it, but I'm just lost. I have no friends and nobody to talk to. I play ps4 by myself and it's just getting to me how lonely I truly am. 
I'm always up to making new friends. 
Alittle about myself. I enjoy bowling, coloring, gaming, watching movies (mostly horror). I'm weird and awkward. Got any questions feel free to ask away."
1140,So that's what its like,"Over the weekend my friend invited me to his bday party and i actually decided to go and at my relief it was a small party of only close friends. It was fine i contributed enough to the conversations as to not be completely silent but being there really showed me how absolutely fucking alone i am. My friend had like 30 people in the house and all of them i mean all of them treated each other like family. I have no other way of describing it as ""too nice"" even his parents where really nice to everyone. Idk am i overthinking things ? Is every family like that? What's wrong with me that i don't have all the caring friends and family that my friend has. Im not even that close to him i only met him my last year of highschool so i don't understand why he even invited me but that's a useless thought now. Im just confused after all of it and its not an insult to them but i swear to god everyone seemed so fake it gave me this weird feeling of jealousy ? Emptiness? Shock? I just don't get it i don't get any of it how do people obtain such large groups of people who care about them how? Its not like i was long time friend either its just weird he invited me. I sound ungrateful but i swear im not i don't ever go to party's and when i do get dragged along  9/10 its awful but this one was infinitely better everyone was nice and not insanely loud and obnoxious. Sorry reddit this has kept me up since 2 am and its now 7:04 maybe i just had to get it out i don't know."
1141,anyone take antidepressants/ anxiety meds before?,"hey everyone. past few weeks i've been very unmotivated and my mood has been at an all time low. i've also gained alot of weight which makes me feel even sadder.   


i went to my therapist on saturday, and she reccommended that i start antidepressants/anxiety medication. i'm reluctant to medicine, but i want to feel better. i'm curious of other people's experience with them. how do you feel on them? did it make you feel better or worse? any side effects?"
1142,This May Be My destiny. Life's Test To See How Much Pain A Human Can Endure Before Giving In. How Many Times Can A Human Be Broken Before They Stop Fighting.,"People say suicide is a cowardly act. That it means you were too weak to survive. The straggler. My grandmother used to tell me I'm weak for wanting and preparing for death at my own hands. I used to believe her. I did. Truly. But I disagree with her very very strongly now.

I've been fighting and fighting and fighting my demons for years. My depression. My rage. My split personalities. And the only thing I ever did to keep going, was nothing more than blind faith. But that's gone. My battle scars are becoming wounds again. 

I knew with each battle for life and everything to come with it was gonna teach me something. I thought it would teach me to become stronger. To rise above all the agonizing suffering. But not only did it teach me to endure and grow comfortable with the pain. 

It taught me that everything will eventually become exhausted and worn out. Including endurance and being comfortable. That is why I can endure the pain and smile like nothing is killing me until every so often I break once again. Lose my mind. Shifting personalities. 

I used break twice a week. Sometimes more. But lately it's getting more and more consistent and gradually rising to hours. Exhausted and worn out. My mind and body can't handle everything at once. It's why breaking turns to hours now instead of twice a week.

I lost everything yes. But I thought I couldn't lose anything else. I was very wrong. I can't get into the situation without risking emotions that could trigger another shifting. What I can say is that time is short for me. Either things get better and I can learn to have genuine happiness, or things get more and more difficult like it has been for almost a decade and I lose myself to other personalities.

Or I make the decision that some people fear. To cut the line. Stop hurting. Living is killing me. I want to believe it gets better. Truly I do. But I can't anymore. This has been my life. I don't think I'm meant for something good, so don't waste your time telling me otherwise, please ,it's too late for that. One good event has been promised to me. I don't trust promises but I'll humor them. 

If this promise goes south like I expect it to because I know I'm not supposed to have a win. I think that will be it. I think my life is balanced on that day in the future. It could go either way. But in time I'll know what I have to do."
1143,What to do next in life,I am 18 turning 19 and in my final year of school (Y13) and I'm having to decide whether to go to university or leave it for a year and work for a year. But I dont want to do either. It's so hard to try to plan for the future when you dont want to even live the life you have at the moment. Is there any advice anyone has for me on how to handle this? What did you do after school?
1144,I have no idea why I'm feeling like shit,"I'm 23, in a stable job that pays very well and allows me to travel the world (I'm currently in the Caribbean), I have a beautiful girlfriend who treats me so well, and we work together so we spend loads of time with each other, plenty of friends, and a few very close ones. In general, from the outside my life seems pretty awesome. 

But I feel like shit. Absolute trash. I'm constantly worrying that I'm not doing the right thing at work, that I'm saying and doing the wrong things with my girlfriend, I have big self esteem issues, and I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life; I literally can't even picture myself in the future, despite making plans for the future with my girlfriend. I can't even remember the last time I was actually happy.

Why am I feeling like this?"
1145,My lil cousin died how should I feel?,"Reddit i kinda need your help processing this:
My lil cousin of 18 yo died yesterday, she's lost a 2year battle with cancer. We were so close growing up me being an only child. 
I couldn't handle the news of her having that serious of an illness so i just blocked the news in my head.. i was trying to reach out in the beginning.. but she was in and out of coma, it was always her mum that answered. And i stopped doing so very quickly after that, it did help that we dont live in the same cities.
My reason was that i am dealing with depression, and last few years havnt been the bestest, and i ""chose"" to (its more a question of not being able to, rather then  choosing not to) not get involved or be in touch with her mum or my uncle as an act of ""self preservation"", i tend to completely dissociate and not be able to function when i face any emotionally demanding situation, and also because of extreme awkwardness, i never know what to say or how to say it
Today i woke up to the news that my cousin died. I am torn between the depression of loosing her and the anxiety to express my condolences and the guilt of not being more there, but also a coat of aloofness cuz practically  this will change nthg to.my day to day life.. she's been in hospital forever by now... i know thats horrible to say.. but i dunno any other way of not just sinking
What should I be feeling? Cuz im feeling everything and nothing right now..

You'd  think being depressed for so long i'd be a pro at feeling sad -_- 
Also what can i possibly say to her parents now after i havent been in touch for so long? I dont think they'll understand that their daughter was in real pain and i didn't care enough to be there becuz of ""not wanting to be depressed"" .."
1147,Scared to open up,"So, I've reached a point where I want to open up about my feelings because I cant take it anymore. I want to get better, but at the same time I want to stay in my sadly comfortable, depressed state. I barely talk about emotions and for the past years I have lied about my feelings, told everyone Im alright, which Im definitely not. Now I dont know where to start, who I should talk to and what to tell them. Im pretty sure that I need professional help, but Im too scared to take the first step. 
Has anyone gone through something similar and some advice to share?"
1148,right place to post but I didn’t know where else I could,"I haven’t been diagnosed with depression and am pretty sure I am not depressed but I figured maybe some depressed people will feel the same idk. Anyone else feel like every logical part of ur brain KNOWS ur honestly not very bright, talented or good at anything really, but the irrational emotional part of yourself is disgustingly egotistical/narcissistic that prevents you from TRULY accepting this? Like I KNOW I’m not a very smart person and as a result I will probably have to live my life working hard for things that come to most people naturally (more on that later) but I find it very hard to truly accept this and as a result I am unable to move forward or come to terms with who I really am. Not only this, but I am not only stupid but incredibly lazy because I give up easily. And the reason for this is because I don’t WANT to have to work harder to understand things/develop skills that come much much easier to the average person. I’m a weak person I admit and have been this way since a very young age and I simply do not think I can cope with living like that. I feel very embarrassed to have taken a life from someone else that could have been- what I mean by this is my parents are both relatively intelligent people and unfortunately by pure chance I was created instead of someone who could genuinely provide some meaningful benefit to society. The only way this can be done is if you are either intelligent, kind hearted or both. I hate to say it but I am neither of these things and feel like I’m taking up the space of someone who could truly be great."
1150,Feel like pure shit,I’ve been like this for ages and no one in my life knows. I doubt they care either
1151,i’m crying in the street,"Today is my birthday.  I planned everything to make this day perfect.  I made an effort and decided to be happy.  I ate my favorite breakfast and planned a special outfit.  but almost all my friends have forgotten my birthday.  Only 5 of them and my grandma actually remember it.  that’s still some person, but when I think about all the person that call themselves my “friends” it’s really not much . even the person I consider my best friend, and people I have known for 5 or 10 years.  none of them remembers it.

it makes me so sad to see that they don’t care that much about me.  when you don’t have the stupid cake on snapchat, all your “friends” disappear.  it makes me so sad to see that all my loved ones don't care. 

Today I’ve worn a skirt outside for the first time.  the result is that people looked at me badly and two men whistled at me.

Today I’ve made an effort to have a good day, and the result is that I’m spending my birthday alone walking on the street and crying.  i hate myself so much."
1152,I think I need help.I,"I probably need help. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m watching myself get closer and closer to killing myself. I want to throw up writing this. I don’t really have people I can or want to talk to about this. I’m the goofy kid that’s easy to talk to and fun to be around for the most part. No one knows this side of me. If I told anyone it’d be kinda outta left field. These people are decent so they’d care enough to try to help. But I’m not worth the help. Even without letting them know I’ve asked for help in minor ways even then I’m burdening these people. In a real way. Besides even if they were willing to just listen it wouldn’t help anything. I’m still in the middle of this great big pool of suffering. I do have fun from time to time but it’s never been enough to make life worth living. My family has enough to worry about trust me I don’t really need to add to it. Even tho I have the opportunity to work and make money I seem to hate work. I need the money to live. I know this.  And yet I don’t go. I’m just so tired. Tired of not going to work and hating myself for a decision I consciously made. I’m doing this to myself. I deserve death. Besides if I’m not willing to work I’d rather die than continue to be a parasite that sucks life money and time from others. 

Anyway I think I might die soon. I feel like I’m watching myself on a screen. Idk what to do. I want to die but it seems another part of me doesn’t want to even tho I feel void and hopeless."
1154,Just want to feel relaxed again.,"I can't remember the last time when I was fully relaxed. I am always stressing about something or feel really tired even after a long sleep. I am 22 year old I should be going out with my friends meeting new people but I don't want to do any of that, I always feel to tired to do anything. At 22 years old I am living and feeling as a retired man in his 70s."
1155,Hopelessness,"Many people in the world have some underlying ability to simply coast through school, work, and life, This skill often intrigues me because I don't seem to have it. I think most people forget to question they're true motives in life and simply follow the herd. If someone isn't necessarily cut out for the societal roles that most follow, they are seen as an outcast or someone who just doesn't fit in. I am a pretty normal kid when it comes to everyday life, but deep inside I seem to find this despair and hopelessness in the average ""American dream"" lifestyle. I'm currently failing out of college, am not currently employed (for mental health reasons), and continue to fall into a deep depression and overwhelming anxiety. Not sure why but I feel like the world just wasn't meant for me. Not that I am suicidal but I feel as though life isn't worth the suffering, despite bearing all the responsibility that I can manage. All the self-help that I have managed to include in my daily life (exercise, meditation, social skills, mindfulness, responsibility) doesn't seem to quell the pain of existence."
1156,Delhi / help,"I am 22 y old engineering graduate  preparing for some job good with girls, have good friends , had good childhood my father was in army , mom works in a hospital I have always been average in my studies

1157,I[22M] may be losing the battle and I'm on the edge of falling deeper,"Around 2 months ago I experienced a major breakup with my girlfriend of 5 years. My friends were there to pick me up in the first month - we were going out, drinking and overall keeping me busy. Then I also actively started working on myself to get over the breakup, I resumed my training, practicing my guitar etc. I'm almost over my ex and that feels great.  


It was going on so well and I felt better. But now everythings started going back to how it used to be. My friends have resumed their lives and are no longer free to go out since they're all in relationships, uni and work. 

  
I have started to realize how much I crippled my social life when I was in a relationship just so I can spend more time with my ex. My friend circle is only around 4 people who are all busy. I can't meet anyone new because I have no mutual friends to go out with. Also, since I'm final year in uni, everyone has already formed their own circles there. My work friends are just that - work friends.   


I haven't went out with anybody in over 2 weeks and I barely text with anyone. The loneliness is starting to creep in and I can't fight it anymore... I don't know what to do."
1158,Comparing the misfortunes or circumstances of others is fucking stupid,"""You don't have it as bad as others"" ""people have it much worse""

Isn't this kind of thinking so irrelevant? Bad feelings don't change just bc somebody has better standards. Depression is depression.
It's your mind fucking you up, not your circumstances. Ofc they play a role but my god that sounds just as stupid as ""depression is just a mindset""

Fuck"
1159,My life is fucked up...,"I don’t wanna talk about my problems, but are there ways to make u feel good?"
1160,My house caught on fire,"When I thought things couldn't get any worse and I should look at the positives in life. 

Hey atleast I'm not dead.."
1161,"I thought I had managed to escape being white trash, but I'm right back there at 30",I don't see the point in trying anymore
1162,"I really just don't want to live anymore, there's no point.","I just want it to fucking end already.

I'm tired of living."
1163,I'm fine when I'm alone mostly,"Ever wince meningitis I've been more depressed than ever, I get worse when help like a push in my wheelchair or help cooking, things i used to do on my own with ease. My sense of independence is gone. However when I'm home alone all day im more or less not really depressed or in a bad mood. I hate it because it tricks me into thinking im getting better and then I smacked with overwhelming depression all night. I've been sleeping like 12 to 14 hours a night average the past few months and not eating the best. I also am getting overwhelmed with the mess I accumulate as it's tough to clean but also just no motivation. I'm so fed up with this"
1164,I have made too many mistakes,"I dont think there is a way to redeem my life anymore. Last year around this time i had a mental breakdown and i isolated myself for around 5 months- i stopped university because i just couldnt leave my bad and lost every kind of motivation towards life. I started taking pills and started leaving my bedroom and then my house more often. I underwent an emergency operation and the pain of that plus my family’s worry of that hit me double hard. I was a student of philosophy, i chose that degree with my own will even though everyone kept telling me it wont bring me anything in life, but i didnt care. Before my mental breakdown, the university life really made me able to see how mean life is and i just couldnt deal. After my surgery, seeing how much you need money to survive and to help someone, i decided i should change my degree and in my country the law profession is one of the most profitable, my mom really wanted me to go there too so i decided to do that and i thought it will be a more pragmatic choice and that it will get me back in track with life. Turns out I hate it as much as i thought that i would and that i just cant go through with it. And now im back at the same place where i started l. lost two years. And I dont know what to do anymore and everyone around me is tired of dealing with my bullshit which i totally get but I guess Im just not cut out for the adult life and for life in general. Now i dont know what my next step should be. The biggest part of me wants to die or at least live as if Im dead, doing nothing and just binge eating but then i see my parents and my brother and how much pain i have cost them. The worst part is I feel deeply and I want to do something i just never could figure out what that was, and if i thought i did and pursued it - it turned out to be wrong or it turned out that i was wrong for it. I cant afford a shrink either cause i know that it would be just money lost to my family whith no results cause i think im too far beyond help. I dont know, I just cant seem to get it together what is so wrong with me"
1165,I feel like a loser,"Hello Reddit, hope you're all doing well!

I have been feeling like a loser for a while now, I could not get into one of my dream companies, and it seems like I have my self esteem attached to it a lot, I have been trying to think of ways to let it go, and just live with it, but I think about it on a daily basis. A few of my peers have bagged better jobs than I have, and it's a huge blow to me. I have also been losing hair, and I'm only 21, I'm worried my shot at dating someone is also gone. I have been sending in applications to companies everyday and not one of them worked out. I have been working out, but it's not really helping much, and I was never good at sports, so don't even bother playing any. I'm terrified that I project the image of a loser too, I can't get rid of my beta male characteristics, and I have not been able to get any jobs outside of my country because no company wants to hire someone from outside.  
Would really like some suggestions on how to deal with this all.

Thanks!"
1166,I made my boyfriend happy...,"I can't find a good job, but I used some of the money I had left from my last one to help my boyfriend with the down payment on a house. We painted all the rooms and now we are decorating it. He tells me he loves the house every day. I know he loves me too.

I am so happy I could help him do something he never thought he would be able to do (buy a house). I love him so much. I try so hard to help people. I think it's part of why people step on me. The qualities that make me a good mate seem to encourage people to take advantage of me."
1167,I think 2020 is when im gonna call it in,"I don't feel anything anymore. My head feels heavy every day, I cant remember the years or the memories anymore. I'm just empty. My first and only love left me in August after 5 years and I don't think I can go forward without her. All I needed or wanted was her. Now im left alone without a purpose. I have been suicidal since 5th grade, Im now 21. My parents and siblings have kept me here but I just dont care about anything anymore. The planet is fucked anyways and life seems to never have been such a grand thing. Just suffering and competition.

 Hanging myself would be fitting since I was born with the umbilical cord around my neck. Sounds symbolic. Or maybe I'll just shoot myself. Doesn't matter really. Im going to feel fine in a day or a week or a month from now thinking im through this shit only to fall back in the span of 3 days. 

I really should just set some date and be done with it."
1168,Depression is coming back and I don't know how to stop it.,"First time posting here, apologies if I break any rules. I've had depression come and go over the years, however this recent bout is starting to affect my work. I dont do tasks and struggle to keep track of things I'm supposed to. I feel like a huge fuck up, bosses are constantly yelling at me and I feel like they're gonna fire me soon. Any advice is appreciated. I'm M22."
1169,I'm going to fail the second time.,"I failed in two of the subjects earlier and I think I failed in the re-test as well.
I still have one last chance to get through, next year in June but I think my father would kill me for it. (He gets furious everytime I mess up something, even at smallest most dumb things)
I know for fact I would fail again.
Should I drop out???"
1170,Has anyone here read “The Noonday Demon” by Andrew Solomon?,"I started to read this book after a few months of noticing myself slide deeper and deeper into a nasty state of depression.

I noticed how I felt like I was rotting from the inside, out, and one by one, my hobbies and interests fell by the wayside, until one day recently, I realized that it was a full time job just keeping myself ticking along. 

I had the feeling that “this isn’t right” and “I shouldn’t be this way” I decided to seek professional help.

It’s a good book, and I recommend it to anyone suffering from depression or not. It has a lot to teach us. Also, his TED talks are great."
1171,I can't get rid of it.,"No matter how hard I try I can't get rid of feeling depressed constantly.

It's overwhelming. I've lost all my friends because of it.

1173,Hospital Admition (Again),"Hi. I'm a 21F. I've struggled with depression since my freshman year of high school. I've attempted suicide twice, and have been admitted into the hospital 3 times. 

I'm admitting myself again for suicidal thoughts. I feel worthless and a burden to my family. I can't function. I just want to die. I think about stabbing myself, overdosing on pills, and driving off the road. I'm an annoyance to my family and a failure. I dropped out of college because I couldnt function and I cant hold a job to pay my bills. I even lost my boyfriend recently and that was difficult as well.

I just want to die. I'm tired. I tired of fighting. I just want it to end."
1174,Work is killing me,"I was doing much better with my depression. Almost to the point i would say i was not depressed, untill i started working again. How am i supposed to feel good about myself when i waste so much energy, physically and Mentally at work and have nearly nothing to show for it. Were i am forced to work only 30 hour weeks and get paid only cents above minimum wage. It makes me feel useless, un appreciated by the world. Is my time and knowledge really worth so little that im only making 6 dollers a hour after tax? I graduated school and keep trying to look for a full time with better pay but i never get chosen. Is my time, health, and mind really just worth the lowest of the low? How am I not support to want to take the easy way out and not worry about this. How am i not to get depressed spending all my mental health in trade for 36 dollers a day when my fiance who was home taught and never been to college makes more than 5 almost 6 times as much as me only being a few years older. Everyday i rather just die then go to work."
1175,Empty.,"I guess this is the appropriate community to post this.

All of a sudden I am feeling really empty and down as it gets closer to Christmas. 

My family are very dysfunctional. Both my mom and uncle have extreme mental illnesses and I am not talking about just depression. It affects the entire family.

My grandparents feel so distraught from their behaviour that this is the third year they said they are going to cancel Christmas. I was totally fine with it this year happening but now I'm not? This will be the first proper Christmas cancelled in my house.

And to top it all off, my boyfriend is in prison and can't be home until late next year probably, I miss him so much because he was always there for me. 

I can't talk to anyone but my therapist.

I guess I feel alone this year."
1176,I fucked my self over,It took me too long to realize that depression is the brain's way of saying something is wrong. Mineral and vitamin deficiencies are really what cause depression and people don't even fucking know this. I was aware of it but didn't do the research I needed to to figure out what was wrong with me and fix it. It's all my fault.
1177,I just found out my sponsee (AA) killed herself.,"Very depressed, I feel like I failed her. Would like someone to talk to. Thanks."

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do it. My family loves me but I hate how much of an asshole I am to them. I hate crying over little things and blaming myself for every single thing. I hate comforting myself thinking ""don't worry, you'll die soon anyway"". I don't know, I know it will be the best way out. I've given up. I love my family but if I do then how do you think it will affect them? I'm already a burden on them. I don't want to make their lives miserable even after I'm gone. Will ending it all be worth it? I know living is not.  Thanks!"
1179,I’m just a useless failure,"It feels like absolutely nothing has gone right for me these last few months. First the girl I had fallen in love with moved out of state for a job, and didn’t want me to come with. She broke up with me and I was devastated. The first person in my life I thought I could trust with anything was gone from my life in what felt like an instance. Because I was grieving the loss of my love and fell into a pit of depression I ended up failing a class, possibly two, at my university. Failing this class causes me to miss graduation in May and spend a whole extra year in college and dropped my GPA below the 3.0 level that most companies in my field look for in new hires and internships. I feel like a failure and I let myself and my family down and nobody wants me around. I just wanna be happy."
1180,"We want to have amazing lives, but there's nothing worth doing at all.","Sixteen years old male, seventeen in February. I just went through the first 3 months of Highschool, Junior year. Picked tough courses because I wanted to have a ""good future"" and I ended up struggling, but regardless, the amount of stress that I have had was extreme. On a whim, I thought: ""Hey, in a couple of days I'll finish school, maybe life will be significantly better afterward because then I no longer have to stick to a horrible routine and won't be stressed anymore and I'll get to do the things I love!""

Turns out I was wrong. It fucking sucks how much life seems like a lie and everything you know is literally just subjective information built on what people think they lack. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're poor, you'll say: ""Oh, my life is shit but once I start making more dough then everything will be amazing!""

If you're rich, you'll say: ""Oh, I'm rich, but I still can't afford twenty mansions, I'm sure if I can reach that point then I'll be happier.""

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone seeks the unknown, but no one knows what the fuck they wanna do. We're all told to be engineers and doctors so that we can have good lives, but doctors and engineers don't necessarily seem to be the happiest people on Earth. In fact, many Engineers I meet IRL seem stressed out and seem to hate their lives, but they do enjoy their salaries... though is it worth it to have a shitty life for a good salary?

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like the world is designed horribly... especially when you're born in the Middle East to a Muslim family who's absolutely delusional and believes in pseudoscience and thinks mental illness is a sin. It baffles me how depression runs in the family and yet no one seems to bat an eye or understand that this shit is fucking real. My brother's an insomniac and really depressed, my aunt killed herself before I was born, my fucking dad used to drink because he was depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow though, faith is the answer. It's fucking stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

And the question, in the end, remains: Why are we even fucking living?

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth it to struggle, work this much, do everything in your power to achieve whatever the fuck you wanna do, only for it to mean nothing? I don't mean that in a nihilistic way, but rather, what I mean is: Does it matter if you're average or rich? Does it matter if you have the girl/guy of your dreams? Does it matter if you're driving a fucking sports car? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this attachment to materialism seemingly the supposed answer to the world's greatest problems? Does it really mean anything?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean there's literally nothing to fucking do in life. You can play sports, you can play video games, you can work, you can eat, you can hang out with friends.... but this all just gets exhausting, and I am speaking from experience as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I literally have a strong friend group, I play video games, I play sports from time to time... Nothing fucking helps. There's nothing to look forward to anymore, it feels. Seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

Even TV shows that everyone loves are not of interest to me. I literally tried so hard to stomach everything, it just does not work. And the things I used to enjoy are no longer any fun.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been so bad that I literally would hope I had a religion because at least the concept of hope would blind me enough to get through life, but at this point, I genuinely wish I had the ability to put a gun to my head.

&amp;#x200B;

And believe me, I'm not driven by my ""teenage hormones"", I'm driven by a realistic view of the world... Maybe I am being a pretentious teen, but I don't think what I'm saying is incorrect. Someone like me with dreams of making music and writing stories has no place in the world, it literally feels like everyone else is smoothly going through life while I'm the idiot that struggles in class and is troubled and fucked up and doesn't seem to get anything right whatsoever. 

&amp;#x200B;

The world feels like it isn't designed for people like myself, and suicide literally becomes very compelling after the fact."
1181,I can't stop crying,"I'm depressed, sick, hungry, schooless, and I have a fucking terrible dysfunctional family. I'm so upset, just so so upset right now. I just feel like I need to rant. And solutions? I have no idea. I tried so hard, but I can't find a single fucking solution. I haven't cried in a while. It hurts everyday, but it hurts so much at this moment. I've been keeping it all in. I don't know who to turn to. I'vr been escaping from all my problems and all my feelings, and it's slowly flowing out. What do I do. I just fucking hate this. I hate this country, this family, this shitty world. Please save me. Ps. I'm from Singapore."

But I wish I was dead because I never knew that there were people who would want to see someone else fail. My life sucks,those kids suck. People of their color are dying and being diagnosed with depression because of what they do. I just wish I went to a private school. I’m tired of crying and hooking school everyday because of them. I hate it,I hate them,and I’m considering killing myself. I’ve already ran away from home at least twice. But I got so fucking lonely and so scared that I came back after a month or two. I don’t know where my head is right now. But today’s my first day going back to school. I guess you guys could wish me luck.🥺😔"
1184,Is my depression fucking up my intelligence or is the depression a result of the realization that I've been this way all my life?,"Hello everyone,

Originally I wanted to write my life story but I don't really see the point. Instead, I started writing about my issues and noticed that there is so much and there is no way I could get a helpful response (actually, I decided to leave it at the end as a P.S.). So I want to hear you opinion on the following: 

In recent months, I've become very paranoid, fearing that I've been mildly mentally disabled and that everyone I know kind of adjusted to that by providing me with an emotional safety net. The paranoia was induced by smoking weed but the fears have been exacerbated while sober over the past months - especially by a few situations which confirm my conspiracy theory.

Long story short, I decided to start visiting the psychotherapist. But this is where I see an even bigger problem. This paranoia seems to be reaching so deep so that I wouldn't even trust a psychologist or my best friend should they reassure me that I merely have typical problems everybody my age goes through and that I am not intellectually inferior in any way.

Whether or not this paranoia is a result of major inferiority complex that set roots during my childhood, the point is I am not sure how I would cope if somebody came up to me and told me with a straight face that I am indeed ""a retard"". I've never thought about suicide but it is something I catch myself thinking about more often recently. And this is the paradox. If I was indeed slow and people knew that I would never be able to live with the harsh reality of having special needs - I dont think anybody would ever tell me the truth for my own life's sake.

So as a result, I am in this meta-state of feeling mentally disabled and blaming it on my depression, keeping some hope that I would become normal again once I get out of this hole. But right now, I dont really know what to do. **So it is basically a correlation/causation dilemma.**

One more thing that might be useful for you as a reader - I've been rereading my post several times and rewording it. My speaking skills are atrocious - no matter which language I communicate in (I know 3 fluently and understand 1 pretty well).

P.S. If you want to read my original draft, here it is:

Originally I wanted to write my life story but I don't really see the point. The gist of it is that I've always been rather introverted, smart in elementary school, socially anxious and autistic-like. I spent most of my teen years playing computer games, suffering from major sleep deprivation for years probably.

But most importantly (to get to the point of this post), I've always suffered from some kind of **anhedonia** \- which I think is the main reason for my social isolation. I almost always felt tired and fatigued. I think at the age of 13 or 14, I came across the term **derealization** for the first time. I started suspecting that I am not perceiving life as I should - it felt gray and like a chore - as if everything I did everyday I was doing for someone else or because that was ""what I was supposed to be doing"" and that it wasnt me who was living life but solely my body was and that my consciousness was distantly connected to it. At some point, I thought that I had fried my brain by the extreme computer gaming (we are talking 10 hours+ every single day). 

As a consequence, in my last high-school year, I started to open up to experiences in real life, started going out with friends, drinking, smoking weed. Smoking weed had been a very controversial experience for me, because it kind of helped me get a glimpse of how I imagined ""normal people"" perceived real life - I finally truly enjoyed music, colors, emotions, I could laugh wholeheartedly (often even excessively in a way that might scare other people). Life kind of got on a meaning I lacked otherwise.

The flip side of that ""plunge into real life"" using weed was major self-doubt. Actually, self-doubt sounds almost harmless. It felt much worse and frightening; like a dark, lurking suspicion about my whole essence as a person and my role within my social circle. It induced doubts about whether the people I considered my friends were just tolerating me or even much worse - that they knew something I did not: that I had mild mental disability and that they felt a sense of responsibility to keep me emotionally stable by giving me an illusion of a normal life. Kind of like the Truman show.

This frightening feeling always seemed to go away after some time and I stayed away from smoking for quite some time during uni - until I did again a year later and got completely wasted. And I havent recovered several months later. I've become much more aware of situations in which people act in a way that confirms my Truman show conspiracy theory of being babysit and treated like a kid:

* The fact that I cant hold proper conversations bothers me much more than it used to.
* The fact that I am good at playing the piano but have absolutely 0 creativity. I cant think of anything on my own.
* The fact that I often misinterpret texts, people and have a very hard time summarizing concepts or opinions.
* The fact that I sense I should see the world with different eyes - it shouldnt be that dull and boring, right?

And what makes all this even harder is the fact that I dont really feel like the same person even a week ago. For some reason, I feel as if every day another ""me"" wakes up and starts to figure out life. I dont think I comprehend the true meaning of my diary entries I've written down a couple of months ago - be it because of poor writing skills (I always sucked at writing in school and even now at uni) or simply because I might not be able to precisely translate the way I feel into words. **There is a huge disconnect between what is going in my head and the real world.**"
1185,Why Does Minecraft Music Make Me Cry 😢,So Nostalgic I swear
1186,It feels like its time,"I have never felt such acute pain, hopelessness, and weakness. I am disgusted by the person I see in the mirror. I feel pathetic, weak, stupid, naive, useless, and small. I want so much to be a new person, but it feels like no one would care. 

I reach out in small ways, but honestly i never tell the whole truth. So maybe anonymously on the internet is the easiest way for me to say it. 

I want to kill myself. I don't see how to get out of this endless loop. Maybe im just not trying enough. But it feels like the goal i am working towards is not actually being offered. Like someone else has already made up their mind. I am their last obstacle.

I am my own worst enemy. I burn every bridge and smash every chance. I deserve to die. Every day i feel another strand snap, but i don't know how many more there are. I feel like i am loosing myself in the never ending descent. I feel numb, but underneath its like a rushing river of anguish, anxiety, paranoia, and guilt. I can hear my own subconscious telling me to just end it. I can see them around me encouraging me to end it. I would hurt a few people, but it will probably hurt them less than making them endure me another day, month, or year. 

I don't know where else to go."
1187,I hate myself,"I see other people happy and get angry at myself and wonder what’s wrong with me that I can’t be as happy as them, when I go out and see other people smiling it’s like the world is pointing a giant middle finger at my face and telling me “Fuck you, just kill yourself as you’ll never be as happy as these people”"
1188,Medication side effects.,"For the past 2 months I've been severely impacting my partners sleep. He says ive been having night terrors (which i have minimal recollection about.) He says throughout the night I'm uttering threats, punching and screaming.

Im on effexor XR, upped to 225mg in June. 
I have PTSD as well as depression."
1189,"No Energy, No interest, No motivation","I don’t know what to say or where to begin I’ve just slept for 12 hours and then feel asleep for a further 2 hours and I now find myself still in bed at 1:30pm I think I was suppose to be meeting friends in town but I just can’t be bothered but don’t want to face telling them I can’t be bothered to go. 

my self confidence is through the floor and I’m beginning to hate myself more and more as the days go by, the thought of returning to a job I love next year is becoming less exciting and something I’m not looking forward to in the slightest, I hate myself for the person I am currently and I wish I had a different life. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you do."
1190,"I haven’t had a fear of death for a long time, but apparently that’s not okay","I can’t even remember when I last feared dying. I’m not saying I’m necessarily suicidal (at least not right now) but I’m not afraid if it comes. It seems to piss off my doctors (I’m diabetic and don’t really manage it) and I’ve had the “if you don’t manage this your going to die a lot sooner” speeches and it gets tiresome. If I die, fine. But I constantly get guilt tripped about this, doubly so since I have a kid. Yeah I’d like to be there for my kid, but if I die I’m not going to care. That’s the beauty of oblivion. I just want people to stop making feel bad for being okay with dying one day."

1193,"i'm not an introvert, i just dislike MOST people based on their personalities, NOT them merely being human","i'm def. not an introvert, but i seem it.  
i live in a country where most people don't really do that much for me.  
a country where i generally disagree with most people politically which also can affect other aspects.  
the left vs right mentality, you know?  
but i remember i saw a woman in a store from my home country, and suddenly i felt myself being very outroverted and started small talking.

SO I'M NOT INTROVERTED. IT'S THE PEOPLE AROUND ME."
1194,Some people have it worse than you.,"Yeah? I’ll gladly swap places with them if it makes them feel any better because I don’t to experience my life anymore than someone else’s.

1195,Disadvantages of depression!,"Anyone with depression will know that yes you might not look sad or like anything is wrong but that’s where it all happens. Depression is a mental disability, and what people don’t realise is even if you have a fake smile on or you force a laugh you are still depressed. Depression is an unfortunate feeling and I get why and how people can get so bad they get suicidal. I’ve been there and tried that, you may think it’s the right thing to do and that it’s the easiest way to end your suffering but that’s where your wrong. 
Talk to someone, a friend, a brother, a sister and stranger it doesn’t matter as long as you find someone who won’t judge you for one of the worst things you can think of. 
So from someone who is now classed as a survivor of you or anyone you know is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts talk to someone, because the moment you start taking about it it gets easier. 

Much love to all, and remember be happy 🙂"
1196,I feel like a failure,"due to past bullying and neglect in my childhood, i developed social anxiety and depression. My nrain feels like im unworthy. My brain thinks the only way to protect me from others and to feel good enough is to be perfect. 


But of course no one can, and my anxiety/depression effects my functioning which makes me feel even further from ' perfect'. 


In short, i wake up in the morning feeling like a failure. Ieel like a failure if i cant be perfect, which on one can so i think theres no point in doing anything at all and end up being depressed.


I'm not looking for people to tell me i don't need to be perfect, i'm wondering what i can do to truly get past this. 


I'm starting therapy for it in Janruary , but in the mean time. 

I have big goals and i dont want this holding me baci so much anymore, it hurts so much."
1197,"How to keep on track, motivated and keep passion?","For the first time in years and years I have found something that has actually sparked something in me and I want to do it. After visiting Japan I fell in love with the place so much and I have found out you can go over there to teach English. I have all the requirements to get the role and I desire it so so bad.

How do I keep in this state of mind? I feel like I’m just going to forget about it next week because I doubt good things will ever happen to me. I need this to happen, what steps can I take to make sure I keep my head on this?"

1199,"New job, new stress (26m)","I recently got a new job that came with a pretty good pay. But, it costs lots more to get to in gas and time, and I underestimated how much it would stress me out. I can't afford to just quit, but everyday I'm driving in having a borderline panic attack and by lunch I'm contemplating walking out the door driving until I have no gas left. My mind is spinning and I've reached out to therapy but I can't afford it because of how much travel costs. Any one underestimate their new job? Kinda freaking out here."
1200,Defensive about depression,"I hate it when people point out, ""Everyone gets depressed at some point in their lives!"" It makes it sound like what I'm dealing with is...no big deal. I know whoever says these things is just trying to help me see that depression is common, and I'm not the only one who has ever felt this way, but it's almost invalidating to me.

Also in therapy I was recently asked, ""If you could wake up tomorrow and change anything about yourself or your life, what would have changed?"" This...really pissed me off. I'm already trying to change things in my life. I don't isolate myself like I used to, I eat much better than I used to (lost 60 pounds too), I challenge the lies that depression tells me every single day, I go out of my way to do things that I really don't want to - like hanging out with friends, family, hygiene, errands, etc. To me, although this question is meant with good intentions and supposed to get me thinking towards a more productive/fulfilling future, it seems like it's... well, invalidating. It makes it sound like I'm not trying hard enough on my own. I am trying. I'm not just laying around, letting it consume me (willingly). 

I feel like I get so defensive when I'm asked these questions. Why?"
1201,"Im worth less than a dog(rant, sorry)","Sorry i didn't take good enough care for your dog while youre away from home. I did take her out to bathroom before bed its not my fault she shit all over herself while i slept, I have work to go early morning. I feel bad for her being a big energetic breed yet having to stay in a cage nearly 24/7 because I cant take care of her. That doesnt mean you get to treat me like an idiot,  only I can do that. At least i make sure my own dog is out of your sight completely when I'm not home by leaving it with someone who'd care for it as to not bother you, and its my own house. Yet every day i have to look at and feed this dog of yours that murdered my other pet knowing im going to get looked down on and scolded anyway when you get home. Just fucking kill me already. I dont wanna watch someone I loved so muchkeep growing to hate me more and more because of how disgusting I am.
Im fucking pathetic. I feel like i dont have much time left and im wasting it being scared over someone elses dog shitting everywhere when im not home or im asleep and getting high or drunk whenever I can. Its all I have now. My only reasons for staying alive is my fucking dog and cat."
1202,"If you abandon the one's you love when they're hurting (and not harming you), you're the worst","I know this mentality probably sounds selfish but I'm so selfless, sad and self loathing in all other aspects that I feel like I'm allowed this one thing.

If you make someone, who is at their lowest, possibly near suicide, feel like a burden, gaslight them or make them feel like they're the problem and that they're causing everyone discomfort with their pain, you're a total piece of poop. Even if the person in lain is struggling, even if they're at a low point, even if maybe they're not doing all the things they're doing like going to therapy, you are total garbage for making someone who already feels like a burden, hates themselves, needs love and care now more than ever, and is at the lowest point of their lives, feel bad about themselves.

I understand boundaries and I respect them. I understand not being able to be there for that person every waking minute because that's actually just selfish. But I don't understand abandoning someone or making them feel worse about their situation or mental health problems then they already do.

This rant was brought on because every single fucking time I'm at my worst, every single time I find myself crying to sleep for weeks straight or not sleeping at all, every time the suicidal thoughts come back and things get real bad, EVERY FUCKING TIME I lose all my friends. Usually the girls who I hang out with the most first. And then, when I'm doing better, when I have money again, when I'm my normal, bubbly self who builds everyone up, acts motherly and makes everyone feel happy by just being around me, everyone always tries to flock back. All the ""wE sHoUld HanG oUt I miSs yoUuUu""s come out of the woodwork. All the ""maybe we can be friends again when you're doing better for yourself"" and ""you're a burden to your friends"" are supposed to be forgotten.

Again, from the outside I may sound selfish but I really am one of the least selfish people I know. I'm the friend who will drive 5 hours in a snow storm to make sure someone's alright, I'm the friend who defends everyone against toxicity, I'm the friend who's their listening to everyone's every last word while I'm secretly dying inside. So I feel I'm entitled to this one thing, this one bout of selfishness, because I'm tired of people being so fucking fake. I'm tired of friends not truly caring and being alone in my worst state constantly. 

In my 23 years of life, this has happened almost every single time I've become really bad, once in high school when my childhood house foreclosed, once at the beginning of college after ending an abusive relationship and now when I'm having serious family problems and my disabled brother is running out of answers for care. Every time I'm hurting, I get abandoned and everytime everyone else is hurting, I'm mother Teresa. I'm so tired of being the good person."
1203,A Love Loved a poem by me,"I loved you, or did i?
why'd we have to let it die?
i don't hate you, but can I?
we fell apart again
it's the start of the end
I don't think i can be your friend

I met someone new
but so did you
do they make you happy
like we were
do they make you excited
for the future

you occupy
my mind
my time
but I am the ""bad guy""
so I guess its, goodbye

goodbye, and fair well
I said as I
I stood by the stairwell
I let a sigh
should I... dare tell

no, i shouldn't
I really won't
oh i couldn't
please don't

I'll keep these lips sealed
I stamp the wax
the words I have yield
stupid feelings
ramp to their  max
but keep these lips sealed"
1204,My First Post,"I have never posted anywhere on reddit, let alone in r/depression, but its 5:00 AM where I live and I need to get some stuff off my chest.

I am a first year university student. Throughout high school I struggled with anorexia, and alongside all the regular teenage angst it pretty much ruined my social life. I've fully recovered physically, but I've been more depressed than I have been in years because now that I'm interacting with people again, I realize that there's something I lack that everyone seems to have. Something I didn't get in my lost years that everyone else seems to have.

In the past few months I've become closer with a person I've known for about a year, and developed some fairly intense feelings for her. I was so sure she didnt reciprocate, but very suddenly she said that she did and had for some time, so we made plans to go on a date. Then just as suddenly, she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, had stuff to figure out, and that we couldn't talk anymore. And well, that fucking hurts. I have a final in eight hours but I cant bring myself to give a shit. She's all I can think about.

I've thought about suicide a lot since I started university. I dont think I could ever get the willpower to go through with it but I have started smoking cause I hear on average each cigarette shortens your lifespan by 4 minutes. I think I'll smoke a pack this afternoon.

Thank you for reading."

1209,I thought I was finally doing better...,But one day can set you back even more than you think. I just need to not exist anymore...
1210,The day after,"Throwaway bc my friends knew when i posted here some time ago.

Well yesterday was a very bad day. I went home just after i finished my first lesson in university. I became anxious and was fearing that i would be alone in the next lesson because i dont have friends there. I left and was very pissed off myself because it was a situation everyone would have handled just fine besides my anxious ass. I was overwhelmed by everything that happened so i decided to take a tavor. It helped me to chill for a while but i fell asleep and missed my appointment with my shrink. My agressions added up so i decided to kill myself tonight. no one coupd stop me so i got some alcohol and some painkillers and tavor. I cannot remember much but i think i became close to OD because i had to puke. 

  
The next morning i woke up sadly and was alive. Right now i dont know what to do it was my second attempt and while i feel overwhelmed by everything my feelings are just lost and non existent.

I thought about getting into hospitel but i have so many liabilities and i dont want my parents to know about everything. Im completely lost and dont know what to do maybe someone of you could help me."
1212,Meds and Therapy: Question for others with ADHD + General Anxiety + Depression about your methods to cope,"I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD since high school and take Adderall IR on and off whenever I need the edge to focus on work. 

I’ll save the bulk of it for the therapist but to sum up my symptoms, I would always be stuck in a rut and my ADHD would cause me to procrastinate and then lead to even more anxiety and depression. In social situations my anxiety would cause a feedback loop of hyperaware self criticism and At home my thoughts would wander uncontrollably from obsessive self loathing to sometimes an existential panic. The fear of rejection or failure and the self hatred would become overwhelming. And beyond psychological scope; excessive worrying, trouble sleeping and concentrating, irritability, feelings of worthlessness, social withdrawal, lack of energy, obsessing over unimportant details, and behaving in a compulsive manner. No suicidal thoughts or psychotic episodes though.

Now I’ve learned to handle the creeping panic attacks and social anxiety but I just can’t get past this dreadful hole I find myself in. I have a career in front of me that I am passionate, friends, and a general sense of purpose in life; a far cry from how I felt a few years ago. Yet despite all of this progress, just getting out of bed and actualizing my goals is absolutely terrifying. My mind is still always on edge and constantly overwhelmed. Adderall cancels out the noise but ironically only exasperates my impulsivity. I just need something that clears my mind and gives me emotional clarity. It’s like when you need that extra boost of courage at a party from a few shots of whiskey, only I need that sense of ease just to get out of bed and I’m not interested in an alcohol addiction.

I’m seeing a psychiatrist after the holidays but I was wondering what methods other people took to get past these symptoms. What kind of medications work for you? Does behavioral therapy work at all for you? What has your experience been like overcoming depression and anxiety?"
1213,I feel like everyone I know is tired of hearing about how I feel.,"Long story short, I (21M) have had an on/off relationship with a girl (21F) since I was 16. The relationship is bad when it’s bad, but the fucking best when its not. We are currently broken up and I doubt we will get back together again but everytime that we have (3 or 4 times) it has been before Christmas. Since we started dating years ago we’ve never missed a Christmas or New years as a couple. Which in turn means that every year, around October, which is when we first got together, I get extremely depressed and anxious and can’t keep her out of my mind. All I really want is to be able to talk to my friends and family about how I feel and to get it off of my chest because it feels like a terrible weight on me all the time and I feel like I’m stupid as fuck for feeling this way but It’s not like I choose to feel this way about someone who has hurt me. I’m getting a little off track but I feel like no one wants to hear me talk about my feelings because it happens every year and they’re just tired of listening to me struggle with the same things and make the same dumb choice to get back with her. I love her very much and if I was given the choice I probably couldn’t resist giving it another shot, but I’ve been very good about it this time around, I have her blocked on everything and I know she has a boyfriend right now so its not even on the table, but I just want someone to listen to my feelings and not just get annoyed or upset that i feel like this after all the shit me and her have put eachother through..."
1214,I may want to end my life today.,"I haven't been sleeping, I haven't been eating, I haven't been well.  I don't want to be here anymore.  Life is too hard.  I don't even know who I am.  I don't do anything I love, because I can't find the energy and motivation.  All I do is lay in bed or on my couch.  Antidepressants don't really help.  Nothing seems to help.  I don't think I can do this anymore.  Not to mention I came out to my friends about my anxiety and apologized for my lack of communication and they backed me in a corner and told me I have been ""dishonest"" for not talking to them about it in the first place.  So I really don't have any friends close to me anymore since they abandoned me in a sense.  I want to leave the world today to find peace.  Peace isn't here.  It never was for me.  I feel so alone and lost.  I can't stand to be in pain anymore.  I may end my life today."
1215,I’m such a shame,I feel like I’m useless all the time.
1216,Mighty trapped,"Fuck this mental illness, seriously. Fuck it’s existence, it’s effects, just everything. 

I’m changing antidepressants and everything has totally gone to shit. I’m paranoid and anxious as fuck - to the point I completely avoided a work social yesterday so I could come home and sleep, a colleague acting a bit weird with me is making me paranoid as to what I’ve done or said to cause it (and what the hell do I do next, even though she’s assured me all is fine, I still don’t believe it), and just everything is piling up and I can’t escape it. I feel so badly trapped in my mind, I genuinely am ceasing to function. 

AHHHHHHHHHHH"
1217,I’m too much of a pussy to do it,"I want to start off by saying this is purely an emotional post in an emotional moment for me and I don’t want anybody that reads this to be concerned for me.
I used to have depression bad, suicidal thoughts daily,  but around the time I graduated high school I began to explore new things and meet new people and felt a bit more fulfilled and I was happy, for awhile. Now, a few years later I’ve been having those suicidal thoughts again. I feel so dull, even in my happy moments I feel blank. I have goals. I’m working on a future, but honestly I don’t really care if I get there. Lately I’ve just been wanting to die and be done with all the hurt. My problem is I can’t do that to my family. Ending the hurt for myself would just transfer it to those that I love and care about, and I can’t bring myself to do that to them. I’m so sick of life but I have to be strong for them."
1218,"How do you help someone with very, very low self esteem?","My friend has had a real bad childhood, full of people abandoning her and filling her head with bad thoughts. Her self worth has gotten so bad, that just playing a video game and losing with make her quit because she thinks im laughing at her in my head, or if im knowledgeable on something, she will just get upset and claim that she has no interests. She is going to get therapy soon, but are there some ways to start building a better sense of self-esteem from other techniques, even in a very minor way?"
1219,My favorite fantasy ❤️,"Does anyone ever actually fantasize about what it's like to not have depression and anxiety? I do this all the time. Some of friends don't any mental illnesses and while I'm so happy for them, I'm so very envious. For example, I fight every morning at 4 when my wretched alarm goes off while some folks can actually sleep in a little longer. This is one of MANY fantasies that I have. Like seriously, what is it like to just wake up happy or at the very least, indifferent? What is it like being able to sit through a nail appointment? Or even something like going to see a movie at the theater? What is it like to not start the day off sad, and without this huge dark fog surrounding myself? Naturally mentally healthy folks have no idea how process that is. I wish I could experience it, if even for just a day. Could you guys even imagine?"
1220,It's my fault,"Here I am now. Back on the floor of the facts. I think I am a semi toxic person and I am not really good for others. I searched for 8 years for love, actually gave up, but then she came. She really loved me as I am. She gave me so much warmth and attention. In character a woman as you can ask for. But I ruined everything. I am a narcissistic, envious jealous person. I have never been satisfied with myself and have always expressed it. In addition, I am very negative. At the beginning people still think I am a friendly, trustworthy and personable person. But after a while they realize that something is wrong. I lost all my good friends over a long period of time. Now I stand there with the knowledge. Feel broken and lonely like never before. I know I have to change. It will be difficult but it is the only way. Are there any of you people who feel the same way?"
1221,I just want to feel like someone cares about me,"I feel like nobody has ever genuinely cared about me at all, I've always been completely alone.

I've never even hugged anyone before.

Something is wrong with me..."
1222,Why can’t I get rid of the feeling of killing myself.,"I’m now 20 years old with a job and couple family members left and I should be happy with what I have but I can’t seem to shake the dark feeling within myself. Started when I was 16, slowly corrupting my personality and causing harm to my relationships around me. I’ve tried to commit suicide few times now with each time something getting in the way or friend finding me. I managed to get the courage to get help but realised it was a mistake afterwards, even potentially effecting my changes of joining the Defence force or Police force eventually.

I constantly try to isolate myself from others destroying friendships to get away and spare them the pain if there was any. It’s gotten to a stage where the depression is a feeling I thrive off like I want to be punished/hurt. I honestly don’t think I have the guts to remove myself promptly however with Xmas coming gives me a chance to end myself during a solo camping trip in the bush.

I’m curious to see who is similar to myself and maybe to make the process of leaving easier.

Thanks"
1223,Dissociated,"I don’t want to go into depth unless there are questions. However i have ONE and one question only. How can I fucking being happy, and feel genuinely fulfilled, loved, and confident? Anyway, I am a recovering poly addict from many years of multiple substance abuse, I’m 18, have a dui on my head right now, medical fees from a heroin overdose, still can’t get over a breakup that happened in late May. My childhood was rough, for my earlier years I lived in San Bernardino, particularly ghetto areas and hoods (Muscoy and East Valley), but later I came to Orange County. Anyway my father was abusive in every way and addicted to meth and later became a drinker. I feel like I was just dealt a bad hand. I feel like both hands are off the wheel now and I have nothing but a bottle in my hand just staring through the windshield. Sure I have good things going like an assistant manager position at 18 years old and some opportunities likes acceptance to community college with a computer science major, being able to sustain myself on my own (moved out of parents house), and I have some friends that are very close. But I just feel romantically frustrated and abandoned, and just fucking alone and I feel nothing, absolute dissociation from this reality. Some days its to the point where I literally can’t feel my skin, could be from dehydration because I do too many drugs and drink too much because I’m a fucking idiot. Whatever, hope you guys enjoyed and could hopefully answer my initial question, Happy Holidays, love you all Reddit. ❤️"

1225,Dental Health and Mental Health,"I’m sure I’m not the only one here who let my dental health go when my mental health did....

I’ve been putting off going for a variety of reasons - the biggest I’ve told myself is that it’s too difficult to make an appointment with the veterans hospital (I have combat related PTSD with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety stemming directly from it) .... which the more I thought about ... the more I realized it was true. They make it such an overwhelming impossible task that someone who DOESNT suffer from mental health issues would have a hard time doing it so to expect someone who does is ridiculous..... the last time I had an appt I was in the middle of a bout of agoraphobia so it was a horrifying experience to go but then I got there and was told that the provider cancelled my appointment 3 days before and I wasn’t notified which they shrugged off like it was no big deal .... I didn’t sleep for almost a week going into the appt and then sat in Chicago morning rush hour traffic to get there... so it was a big fucking deal to me. 

Anyways my teeth have fallen into a state where I can no longer pretend that they aren’t “bad”. My stepdads dentist is a really good guy and is going to see me anytime a patient cancels (I live very close) ... I am still on the hook to pay for some of the treatment but the majority he is doing for free. The problem is I’m overwhelmed thinking about it all .... I’m trying to be proactive but I haven’t been able to sleep and I feel like I’m in this perpetual state of panic I can’t get out of. 

I don’t know exactly what part of all of this is causing the stress and panic .... it’s probably multiple things but it’s really really shitty to not see a way out of this feeling which got me in this mess in the first place. Does anyone else feel like it’s a never ending cycle? 

Any suggestions on how I can handle this panic feeling? It’s not so much the actual physical appt itself - the typical things like sound of the drill or the pain don’t really bug me it’s literally EVERYTHING else all the way down to leaving the house now ... I tried to go out last night to the store just to get something to eat for dinner and I just froze up and couldn’t leave - just went back inside and made soup ... the store is less than a 5 min walk and it was later in the evening when it wouldn’t be crowded but I still couldn’t get myself to cross the threshold of my door ..... I just feel like things are now getting worse and not better so I’m frustrated with the “one step forward two steps back” thing I have going on now.

Any helpful suggestions or comments are welcome!"
1226,This sub rejected me when I was 13. Trying again.,"Nearly 4 years ago, when I was 13, I made a post on here asking for help. I was told by many that I'm just being an edgy kid, that I'll grow out of it, that I'll ""mature"" into a normal person. I ended up removing my post because I couldn't handle all the negative comments and decided to never come back here. I'm now nearly 17 and still depressed, so I'll give it a shot now that I'm less likely to be pushed away for my age.

Got diagnosed w/ clinical depression and anxiety disorder 3 years ago but therapy was way too expensive even with insurance and it just made me feel like shit after.

During these years, I've made and broken toxic friendships, abusive relationships, been bullied. I've also traveled the world. I had to cut off many of my friends because they were rude about my achievements, overly jealous/competitive, and talked shit about me behind my back. None of them know about my condition.

My friends who I do have constantly complain about boy/girl problems and other silly things. I do everything for them, help them with homework, give them rides, listen to them when they're ranting or sad. And then they have the nerve to say that none of their friends are helpful and nobody cares about them. I feel incredibly unappreciated and this makes me feel worse.

I've accomplished so much this year, and I'm on a very good life path. But I can't help but hate life for things that happened in my past. I can't go to a therapist, and even if I could, I hate therapy, and I live in a small area so there's like 2 of them.

I don't know why I'm posting here, I guess I want to know if anyone has any ideas."
1227,I'm a useless human being,"I'm dumb, slow, weak, not the best looking, no degree, bad social skills, not much personality, not much friends, don't see the point in anything. I'm really overwhelmed by sadness and my emotions every day. Dying is painful and scary but so is living."
1228,Anxiety and depression has taken most of my teenage life.,"Me (17 y/o Male) has beeen suffering from OCD, social anxiety, and depression. 
I hated social anxiety the most, I've been given meds for it but it just made me emotionless and just feel like not a real person so I stay away from medications as much as possible, I want to try to go to a psychologist and get CBT but I have no money and my family can't afford it at the moment (I hope someday I can). I am known to be that quiet guy in class, no personality, shy, and just boring and little to no humor guy. I just felt depressed and anxious all the time, I have really kind friends, even I dont talk that much, they treat me as a family, I have a best friend and we've been friends since grade 7, and I am glad he sticks out with me, and I make friends because of him, he is a popular, humorous guy, and handsome to and I am the total opposite of that. the only thing good about me is I am the best at playing guitar in my class and in music I am just the one who stands out. I cant stop comparing myself to my friends and to others, and it's making me depressed, I cant make good conversations, make relationships by my own, awkward, boring to be with, and I cant express myself because of this anxiety, I cant enjoy life anymore and my depression is affecting my ability to focus and my attention span and because of that I need to cheat in school just in order to pass. I hate this its going on for years. I want to have a girlfriend, become a musician and a bussinessman someday and maybe a youtuber, but that seems far because of my mental health issues. I cant help myself. Im losing hope and Im missing out many things in life. And Im afraid this may go on for years more (I hope not). I really want to get my life back. And plus I cant stand up for myself and usually a yes man. I hate myself honestly."
1229,"Still, in 2019, People are still so undereducated about mental illness"," Just feeling a bit annoyed by the convo I had with a friend last night.    

For starter, I don’t have anxiety or depression disorder (although I feel anxious or down from time to time like everyone else) but the guy I am seeing does.    

Long story short, I have only been dating this guy for couple of months and things went downhill several weeks ago because of his depression; he had isolated himself and shut off, didn’t answer my texts for days. When it first happened, I was worried and anxious, thought that if I had done something wrong, but then I quickly figured out it was his depression, not him. Since I wanted to be more helpful and supportive to him, I did shit tons of research, read a lot of articles and discussion here on Reddit, bought some books ranging from understanding neuroscience behind depression and anxiety, to more holistic approaches to ‘ease’ anxiety and depression. Anyway, I don’t judge or belittle the illness just because I did not understand how it feels like.   

Then fast forward to last night, a good friend of mine came over and asked how were things with the guy, I told her about his mental states and her reaction was rather unpleasant. ‘ugh those people’ she said, ‘they are just weak, negative, and would not do something to fix the issues’,     

Although in complete shock of her viewpoint, but hey, maybe she just did not know much about mental illness so I proceed to give her more information with scientific facts. I explained it is not some excuses for people to stay or act negatively, it is caused by chemical imbalance in the brain similar to any other diseases, like having a broken leg or a kidney failure; you get symptoms from it. However, after the lengthy explanation she still not buying it at all.    

‘It’ll take a lot more to convince me’ so she said. I was bummed out from her comments and lack of empathy to those who suffer. I feel the pain and anger and thought, god it must be so hard for depressed people having to go through this, no wonder they shut themselves off from people sometimes. 

If everyone could be a bit more empathetic this world would be so much more beautiful. But what I am trying to say is, despite we get closed minded people like that, I am sure there are more people who truly care and would make the efforts to understand what you are going through, just wish people will take mental illness a bit more serious and be more educated in the upcoming year."
1230,A life of misery and the blank shell,"I’m 30, I’ve been depressed since I was 7. 

My parents divorced, my relatives who I was raised by teased me so badly that I defecated in my pants until I was 13 years old.  I can remember being laugh as a 10 year old on Christmas morning with actual shit in my pants at my Aunts house.  

My family used to say I was retarded, useless, and not good for anything except shitting myself.  My parents would just let this happen.  I think I was honestly just a mistake, because they never wanted anything to do with me except abuse me. 

When I finally went out, made friends, and eventually started partying as a 17 year old - they put me in a treatment facility, cutting off all ties with anybody I knew.  

When in family counseling, they would roast into me how much of a nuisance I was to them and how everything was my fault. 

Months after graduating, my only favorite uncle, only favorite grandma both died in the same month.  The month prior, I got a tumor in my knee.  That same month my brother, the only one who pretty much primarily raised me, tried to commit suicide multiple times. 

I had over 20 episodes of kidney stones and surgeries from 20-30, recently being diagnosed with a rare gene disorder known as CASr.  I will have to take medicine that will dehydrate me substantially everyday for the rest of my life or suffer a stent in my urethra. 

The only love of my life(5 years) and only real gf I’ve ever had left me for another man.  

I had to drop out of college because of surgeries. 

I got injured and will never be able to work my dream job again. 

Recently my dog just turned 12 and isn’t doing so well. 

I just had to drop $2000 on my car repairs in the last 2 months. 

I had to move back in with my sadistic parents, more sadistic then ever, recently due to break up. 

I’m in crippling debt from school and hospital bills, my injury does not allow me to make the money I need to surpass this anytime soon. 

My ex-GF is obsessed with letting me know she’s fucking somebody else. 

I have not 1 friend nor family member I can trust.  

But despite all of this, I guess I’ll try again tomorrow.  This time I’ll come at it different, this time I’ll know I’m going to fail inevitably. 

And it’s going to be all be OK, there was never a shred of hope in my life to begin with.  And tomorrow I will expect nothing less, going back *home* to my parents basement defeated and worthless. 

I’ll go back again tomorrow, I can see pain on a person from a mile away.  I know it with every sensor, I know exactly how to comfort them.  How to make them feel loved.  If it wasn’t for the two long dead relatives who showed me their compassion, I might not be *this*.  

Tomorrow, I’ll have 7 texts from 7 different people, all waiting to dump their emotions, sorrows, and struggles apathetically towards me.  Lord knows not 1 of them will ever to do it for me. 

But I’ll help them anyways, because I never want anybody to experience the true depth of loss for which I’ve felt my entire life. 

I will wake up and physically push my body to the limits, until there is nothing left.  To do anything less would mean to feel again. 

For me, to feel anything at all anymore is a death sentence.

I’m so grateful for my shitty job that I put in overtime to not even make my bills every month.  

It consumes me and makes me forget.  Everybody around me is pissed off and ready to go live their happy lives outside of this shithole. 

I’m sad to leave.  I will face m reality once more when I get back *home*. 

My past was dark, future darker.  But now, well, I’m tired.  Too tired to think, only ramble off a bit before my next shift.  

Which I will go into working as hard and precise as I can, making considerable progress, and my coworker who does nothing all day will continue to receive the raises and promotions. 

I will go into work dead tired, doing laps around 3 fully rested, terrible mood coworkers.  

I will congratulate them on how well they did. 

I give this to you, my dear reader: 

I feel like my life has been the most intense training session ever.  Because the very few times the fog has cleared, I’ve found little to no competitors worthy of what I set my goals in. 

So much pain and heartbreak, never catching a break.  

My family is absolutely terrified of me.  Not that I’m terrorizing them on purpose.. they simply cannot fathom the smile on my face that drives them back into their shells.  The confidence they created from telling me I’m worthless my entire life.  

 But most of all, my adept ability to see **true pain** from almost anything - a fake laugh, an ego, an aggressive attitude. 

I feel invincible sometimes, and it’s my vulnerability that has allowed this. 

Now, fuck me if I can’t catch a break here soon.

1231,Don't know whether I should vent on here or not. There's just so much to talk about. And I'm too ashamed to talk about some of it.,"I wanna fucking give up. Because, I don't think that there is actually any other way."
1232,Shall we force him or leave him?,"My brother has been dealing with depression for at least 3 years. He graduated from school and since then he has dealt with great social anxiety, no contact to others than his family. No job, no further education. He rejects all the help that we offer him. He has no self esteem at all. We are at a point, where we all suffer from that and cannot enjoy our lives anymore. We can’t let go because we love him. But also he won’t let us help him, he does not want to go to therapy. 

What shall we do? How can we persuade him that therapy might help?"

1234,"I wrote this while having a panic attack because of my dad, who is an asshole.","Why?

I have many questions, but the one that comes up in my head the most is “why”? Why have kids if you won’t care for them? Why do you constantly lie? Why do you make promises you can’t keep? Why won’t you be the dad that raised me to be kind and love one another? Why?

Honestly, I could go on and on, but I’d have a book then. I miss my dad, he died several years ago when he stopped pastoring his church. Since then, another man has took my father's body and made life harder everyday since. Some of my earliest memories are of him yelling in my face with his full drill voice. When he punished me, it was way worse. He would take me to a dark room because I was terrified of the dark, and he knew that. So he would whoop me in the dark, just to make sure that my punishment was good enough in his eyes. I am now 18 and still scared of the dark because of those mental scars. 

I understand that this is the past and I should let it go, but I can’t. It’s hard to let go or forgive him for this, mainly because I never got an apology. My dad has a problem owning up to his actions, he’ll find a way to turn it back on you. “I’m sorry you feel that way.” or “I’m sorry it came off that way”. I thought maybe one day he would see what I do, feel the way I do. I’m still waiting.

Sometimes, I blame my dad’s growing up. He was born in 1961, Which means he was raised in a rough time period. A lot of racism, sexism, and homophobia, was around during that time. Not to mention, the Vietnam war had just started. He didn’t really have a stable father figure, men came and went, most of them were in the military, so they weren’t around much. He was raised Strictly catholic, so you think he would grow up to be a respectful man right? Well not exactly.

My dad fell into the wrong crowd. He started using drugs and becoming someone he didn't even recognize. One day he went too far and became aggressive. He and his girlfriend were having a fight, my dad want to have sex, she did not. So he forced her into his car and drove off with her. She pressed charges for Kidnapping and rape. The rape charges were pled down to aggervated asssualt, he was going to serve 8 years and 6 months total. During his time in prison he converted to christaninty for the promise of always being forgiven for his sins. Around the 5 year mark of his sentence he was let go on good behavior.

Now imagine, you are googling people you know of and your curious about your dad so you google his name and find out your dad was put in prison for kidnapping and raping someone. I felt betrayed, I’ve always asked him if he ever went to jail or prison and he lied straight to my face. Still don’t feel right about it.   

It's not over, skip forward a bit to my mom and dad’s marriage. My mom had her own hardships in the past but was forthcoming with it, mom and I never had secrets. That’s why I knew that there was something wrong when she started shutting me out. I would hear her crying in her room softly, but she would never admit it. What I didn’t know, my dad had sent a text to her, that wasn’t meant for her. He was cheating on my mom and it wrecked her. She gained weight from comfort eating, red puffy eyes from crying all the time. She decided to stay with him because of me, and I wish I would have known cause would have told her to leave him.

My mom suffered in silence for years, because he figured he could keep doing it and get away with it because my mom wouldn't leave him. One day, my mom had enough and made him leave. I still didn’t know why, so naturally I missed my dad and asked my mom if we could move to him. So we did, and he continued to cheat there too. We moved again, but mom had enough and she divorced him. 

Finally, we were free, or so I thought. It’s been 6 years since the divorce and he only visits one weekend out of the month.  Which Is fine, except for the fact that each one is hell because he thinks about himself which starts drama. Then the next three weeks are spent healing from that weekend. Then he comes back and does the same thing.

An Idea was presented. He wanted to talk like adults and try to mend what happened in the past, but his one condition is what set me off. His condition was after the”meeting” and he apologized properly the past can no longer be brought up. That’s When I figured out he only wants this over, nothing he would say would be sincere. So I refused. 

He’s gotten away with so much more, I refuse to let him get away with this. 

Today is Sunday, December 1, 2019, and I’m still waiting.   "
1235,having the hardest time ive had in a long time,"how do you guys find yourself to go to sleep or even like stop thinking really dark thoughts when someone you used to date just ends things with you. ive been having such a hard time with this on top of my dad being really sick and school not going very well.
i dont know what to do. everything sucks and its not like just because someone tells me i should take care of myself im going to want to do that. ive been crying for 4 hours straight and i have no sleeping aids, evn though those make me have really bad dreams."
1236,I was made from stupid juice and I will die the same way,Please ignore me I am drunk and fucking braindead
1237,I like pain??!!,"Um so I’ve been diagnosed with mdd for a while now and been feeling fucking empty all the time but there’s this strange pattern where I scratch myself repeatedly bcs of anxiety until it bleeds, it feels good( not in a sexual way) but I’m a way that makes me feel something. Then when I get home I scratch the scabbed up scratches some more and then go in the shower and apply soap to make it burn bcs I enjoy the pain??( not in a sexual way ya nasty) but bcs of the reason stated previously. Is this normal for someone who has mdd?? Pls respond thnx"
1238,I Hate Being Autistic,"I'm 22 with autism and it is unbearable. I'm pretty much nonverbal, but can sometimes form some sentences around the right people. I am in college, but I feel like that just hurts me more because people see I'm in college and assume my condition isn't the way it is. Not to sound egotistical, but I'm not unattractive and know how to be fashionable and groomed, so people write me off even more.

Every time I've tried to get a job since high school, even jobs like McDonald's, I don't get past the interview. When people find out I'm 22 with no job they view me as lazy even though I try. 

I can't have a conversation with anyone. I don't have friends and spend all my time alone in my room. Nobody wants to be friends, have a relationship, or just be around someone that doesn't speak. I have my parents and sister, but once they're gone I will be alone with no way out. I know I'm in the easy stage now because I'm in my early twenties, but pushing past 30 will not be a pleasant life (as if it's pleasant now). When my parents are gone, I don't see myself living long after.  

I'm just a constant burden, resource drain, and overall terrible person to be around."
1239,Help me I messed with my family standart of living and I can not bear it anymore,"I am a 40 year old man with a 3 year old boy and wife. Before I relocated to Netherlands we had a really good life in my home country, my wife and I both had good paying jobs. We had a nanny for our kid at home and had a really good house. For just thinking about future (that in my country seems to be messed up) and kids future we relocated, my wife quitting her job. We though we could sell the house there but we could not now I am paying for mortgage there too. Financially I can support my family here but this is no where near our old standarts, my boy went to preschool but he could not make it there for language problems. He is just sticked to his mother and give not give here some space.

I hate everything here: weather (always closed no sunshine) , people talking ( I can not even bear hearing them) , job ( I can not focus) . 

It was my overly confidence that caused my family come with me but now I suck at everything. I am taking depression pills( prozac like) but that does not help.  I have no close friends ( I am anti-social). I cannot even like videos or games anymore. 

Always thinking about how I fucked my family life just gets me down, in with this down mood I feel my family hates me. 

My wife is stronger than me she says this will pass but I can not get up and stand like a man.

I have suicidal thoughs every morning and I see nightmares every night.

What is worse is I think about hurting my family I do not want to ."
1240,Why,"Why should I stay here if all life is is assigning false meanings to things and tricking yourself into believing that they are meaningful.
          It seems like I do nothing but try to find things that numb my inherent pain and nothing works and I'm so fucking tired of trying to pretend like I understand what people mean when they say "" it gets better"". Fuck you, you've been telling me this for 10 years. Nothings gotten better. 

 It doesent make sense."
1241,Dealing with paranoic conclusions and lack of motivation,"Hey. As explained in the title, I have been suffering with being paranoic all the time. I wake up thinking all the time on the most dumbest ideas and I just can't relax myself. 

The first reason of me being paranoic is about a deformation I have on the right side in the back of my head. It's something that nobody can see it but I can feel it all the time and it really sucks. And the feeling is like my head is cutted in half, just because of that deformation on the right side. It really makes me sad because when I focus on the left side of my head I can feel how smooth it is, like heaven. And then I just realise how much worse the right part is.

Well I guess you may think this is nothing and I should just not think so much and get over it, but I really can't do it because my life has been so empty, depressing and I REALLY can't feel good around people, I've tried it a lot of times.

Yesterday I went out with some friends and I was always that kind of guy that never accepts to go out and all of that simply because I know I won't like it... but at the same time it's still better than being at home all day alone. So I just went with them and sometimes I think to myself how can they just be so happy and laugh and so crative talking feeling this confortable and all. We were 4 and they were all laughing jumping around having fun man, and I was like pushing myself to laugh as well for 8 hours straight, feeling like shit inside and also my head so fucked up. I really can't have emotions so when I'm like trying to be funny or I have some funny story in my head, most of the times I just stay quiet because I can't explain it with emotion and then I know it will be a complete mess. 

I'm also virgin, never had a girlfriend and sex in my life, currently with 23 years old. I've been thinking on having a girlfriend many times but I know she wouldn't like me. I just know it because I also wouldnt like her too... Having this idea to have a girlfriend just to finally have one is just stupid. So I'd rather stay alone until I'm finally cured.

I also don't have good friends, I do have like some friends that are good people of course. But we are not much together because they know I don't like to be with them so much. And when we are together our conversations are so boring because my life is boring overall. I have nothing to say and no will too.

Some people I found on internet said I am a overthinker, I think too much and should just enjoy life. They acted like this was just a little problem but the truth is, I can't see how I can fix this because I can't live with this feeling on my head all my life... it's just so disturbing. And telling this to doctor makes me feel so unconfortable because it seems to be something really small but the feeling is just annoying.

I tried to go to doctor today but woke up too late... Slept 4 hours today, couldn't sleep early. I will try to go tomorrow...

&amp;#x200B;

Alright so any help would be appreciated guys, I'm feeling like this for so long and I don't know how much I can handle this. :(

Thanks."
1242,I think I'm losing it,"Probably not going to get posted cause reddit will think I'm a bot or whatever but maybe typing it out will make me feel better...

Last October I got fired from my job and left my bf of 6 1/2 years by cheating on him a lot (I know I'm the worst). Shortly after losing my home (I lived with him) and my 3 cats (the only reason I stayed with him) I met an amazing man who genuinely loves me. He spoils me and tries his best to make me happy. He has been institutionalized and suffers from depression as well. Well after I got fired I tried to continue doing the same line of work and failed then tried 3 or 4 other jobs and also didn't last long at them either. Well I finally just started another job but I hate the people, the customers everything and I feel so miserable. I can't seem to find anything that makes me happy anymore. I can't seem to feel any real emotions anymore. I try counseling but I can't afford it and I can't keep asking my bf for money. I try and do things that once brought me joy, such as video games and that just is nothing. On top of that today is my one day off with my bf and my bf has completely decided to stop talking to me and we live together so I've gone 24+ hours without speaking to someone. I don't know what I did or if he's mad or if he's just being his introverted self but I tried reaching out to my ""friends"" but both if them simply replied with that sucks and hasn't said anything else. Anyways, I don't want to die but I just don't want to be around anymore. I want a completely new life, new name, new scenery. I feel like I'm losing my freaking mind and I'm getting backed into a corner.

Tldr; I'm sad and this made me feel worse"
1243,Starting to accept things will probably never get better,"I've been battling depression for almost 4 years now with some ups and downs but still never really getting better, only worse in the long run and recently I am wondering if I will ever escape this way of life. These days the only time I leave the house is for work (only 6 hours a week), counseling, and maybe a small errand. This is sad to admit but these past couple months I've found personal maintenance/hygiene extremely hard and will only shower when I have to interact with people. This has happened before but never quite this bad. In the few social situations I find myself in I completely panic and doubt myself the entire time, often times not even able to return the most basic conversation. I feel extremely trapped in these thoughts, feelings, and in my own body for disgust in the way I look. All I ever feel anymore is overwhelming numbness, sadness, loneliness, and anger. Even more recently I have become increasingly weaker physically and will feel a great deal of pain in my chest and will find my limbs trembling, all for no apparent reason. I am scared because I think I might be giving up."
1244,I hate that im so starved of love cuz it makes me a whiny bitch,I always need love and I just want to ask for it 24/7 but that’s not cute ig
1245,I left the house today,"I left the house today. I went to the coffee shop today. Leg feels better today. I have to write today. I believe in the things I do less and less with each day that goes by in isolation, seclusion, idleness, aloofness. I used to believe and maybe at one point I was good. I believed in myself and a future and that I was worth time and affection. I believe these things less and less. I want so much to share myself with someone. It can save me. But I learned how toxic that is, how much of a burden I am, how much pressure it is to have your life depend on someone. I want so much to connect and open up, be vulnerable, cry and tell them I'm in pain, that the best time of the day is when I sleep. 

I'm an after-thought as she begins to settle down and build a life for herself, a career and a family. Why did I fall in love. I was just a toy, something to play with to relieve boredom. I am easy to use. I didn't give enough effort, she said. And she's right. I used to give effort. I used to believe in the things I did. I used to write. I used to play guitar for others, I used to command a room. Now I'm an observer, an audience member, and each day I feel more and more invisible. Soon I will disappear. I don't want you to think it's because you're not good enough, she said. I used to be good. I used to believe in a future for myself. I fell in love. I will talk less and think less, and this feeling will die, and I will become more and more invisible to her, something ""small and undistinguishable, like far-off mountains turned to clouds."" I want so much to share myself. It can save me. I want to be good. I have to move. I left the house today."
1246,Being a good and nice person is not enough,"You  also must be 'smart' especially in terms of knowing how to make money.  And often times, that also means you also have to be opportunistic,  follow the system &amp; rules (just like everybody else), even be  cunning, sly, ruthless, brash, full of tricks, greedy, selfish, ready to  step on other people who are 'weaker' (eg: poorer, etc).

Money  is everything in our modern society today, unfortunately. It's all  about money nowadays. And if you can't beat the system, then you have to  join them. Everyday you are forced to survive, or for survival. And if  you're not strong enough to follow the system/rules, then too bad,  either you will lose, get left out, get sidelined, trampled, kicked in a  dirt, become a loser or failure in society, or you will die because you  can't survive.

Maybe life is just  not for everyone. Maybe some of us are not meant to live in this world,  society, existence, or whatever it is. Maybe it's all really random and  nihilistic, ie: some will live, and some will die. Just like ants, some  will survive, and some will be killed, can't survive, got  unfortunate/bad luck, and die.

Life  is depressing. Society is depressing. This world is depressing. Even  all this whole existence thing is just depressing, mundane/boring, very  limiting, sick, pointless/meaningless (for some people who really  realize it), and honestly, everything is just so stupid."
1247,Currently don't even have a working toilet,"We've been living rough for a while now in an RV. We can't empty the tanks at the moment, so we can't use the toilet. I have to pee outside (not as easy for a woman) or wait until I go to someplace that has a bathroom. 

It's just one more little misery. And the worst part is, a few years ago I thought I was doing so well and managing to avoid living like I did in my childhood. But I'm right back there now."
1248,I already feel like i dont exist.,"My body just feels like an empty shell waiting to expire. I have no soul, no high or low feelings, nothing. I feel numb. I already feel dead. Im just a walking zombie going through the motions of life. Is this a dream? Is this even real?"
1249,Its coming again..,"After a good curve it is going down. Why cant i just cover myself in work and push it away. Why can't i forget it by doing stuff.

Because everytime i hate myself for doing poorly the things i do. It takes so long to grasp how its done.

I don't know why i write here again and again, to people that don't bother or shouldn't hear about it. But i dont wanna bother the people arround me anymore."

They’ve moved, had families, etc. I’m so happy that their lives are wonderful. Last year I was diagnosed with epilepsy and dissociative seizures and my life went from career-woman to someone housebound, unemployed (except for my hobby business) and I can’t drive. Ive been stuck in my house since June 2017. There’s no public transport nearby and I have no close friends or family to help. I’ve become crippling lonely. I have a partner but he works four days at a time with virtually no contact. My son is great but he’s also 4 so there’s not much in the way of adult conversation.

I’ve always wanted the play Magic the Gathering. My partner recently decided he wanted to as well. So I spent a full day learning the rules, how to do combat, what everything means and so forth. Then we went to a local store to but cards that also holds casual game nights and serious matches and we were invited to come down and play. So we started playing at home heaps, but my partner told me we had been playing wrong and the rules I learned were incorrect, so I had to relearn the whole game again with the way he said the rules are. I just took it as he is right, and I am wrong instead of questioning it. Because of my neurological problems I struggle with memory so I worked really really hard to get to a point where I could play. However today my partner told me I was correct in how I was playing originally and he was wrong and I’d have to relearn the game again. So I just quit. It was at the point where I wasn’t going to be able to unjumble the two. And start again for a third time. 

I was so excited and then it turns out I didn’t have it and had to start all over again. It’s not an easy thing to master for someone with my brain problems and I worked really hard. I became really good at it too after about 50 games.


Why did I work so hard? I so badly wanted to be a part of a group. I wanted to go make friends and do something I enjoy. I thought I would finally find a way to get some reprieve from the crippling loneliness I feel. Ever since I became sick I’ve lost my ability to do most of the things I love, I was so excited to make friend close by that I could Uber too and afford it. I wanted to learn new things. I wanted to get in with all of the others games that are played too.

Now my partner is down at the store playing with everyone and another friend because he can pick any game up after a few rounds and I’m at home, lonely, trying so hard to make something hobby wise work for me and I can’t. 

I guess I’m just depressed because I thought I’d have something to ease the feeling of uselessness I feel and I unintentionally got screwed. I was excited and I feel like a dumbass."
1253,Nightmares for several days,For the past few days I’ve had nightmares every day and they get worse and worse. Terrifying detailed nightmares you could never have imagine. Things that will haunt me forever. I wake up crying and with anxiety attacks. They are terrifying. I don’t feel like I can keep this up. I also wake up at least 5 times a night every night. I’m tired of being terrified to death.
1254,How should I contact my peers?,"Hiya, just a minor with depression, don't want to get into the nitty gritty just yet cus y'all some internet strangers. I went away from school for a ""medical"" leave and got back for like a week before school, and I've just been feeling like they're drifting away from me, I've sent them messages asking if we could just talk, but either they leave me on read or the method I'm using to talk to them does not show whether or not I've been read, now with winter break rolling around seasonal moods, I'm not sure if I can really enjoy these holidays, even worse I'm not sure how I'll handle next semester, especially since I did not have many friends to begin with. But I'm just another person on the web

Thanks in advance, Puga"
1255,I'm like the guy from the series «The End of the Fucking World»,"In recent years, I was covered with severe depression, I’m always bored and even when everything is fine, I’m still not happy. It all started with deceptions on the part of the female, of the three girls that I had in my 20 years, all of them deceived me, and I always forgave everyone .. And still forgive, I'm too naive and loyal, and I understand that they just use me, but I can’t take offense at a person for more than five minutes. My brain understands that they continue to deceive me to this day, but I still do what the other person would not do, I continue to believe everyone who lies to me .. I always want to retire, I always have anxiety and pain inside me, I like to be alone. Ask questions and write to those who are in the same situation, we have something to talk about ..."
1256,Just reached 30's Oh boy life is about to get me real good.," 

There’s something wrong with me

I am never satisfied

And even If I feel like I am

Something else comes to my mind

And It gets be back to a place of negativity

I try to be positive

But I think about my future and that is scary

I think of the future of my family, especially of my sister

And then I think about what I’ve done all these years

Give or take 10 years

Doing music

All these years of pain, money, agony and hard work

In the end, it has come next to nothing

I am stuck, bound by visa issues, unable to mass a basic audience. I can’t do these basic things, let alone think a song might be a hit. I have zero to no luck nor does hardwork or smart work equal to success. People judge me, give me these fucked up depressing looks and being nice and natural isn’t good enough anymore you got to be an asshole and I don’t have the mind to be one.

I need to change my sound completely, and that is just better off me trying to work a day job.

I don’t need millions of dollars or to be adored, that is hardly even a goal.

I just need progression, progression that is organic

But now it seems like every door is closed

Performance opportunities have dwindled and my sound has become obsolete.

Can’t really find a good number of paying audience to sustain the band even though the band version 2 has been exceptionally tight and on par with many major bands.

And there’s seems to be no point to bringing all that energy during a show.

I don’t know if it’s worth even performing anymore

It doesn’t make sense

And If I quit then it’s waste of all these years

I really have put the hard-work and it’s nice to have a progression.

But being trapped in Singapore and to do it all over again in another country, for e.g the states.

I don’t have the energy to do another Caitlin Stasey. I am tired, burnt and want to escape and vanish into peace.

At the end of the day, whatever I seem to have enough passion and drive upon, doesn’t seem to work

So I play it safe, it’s hard to be this way. But I guess I don’t want to be hurt and my focus should be on my family for now. 

I have failed them miserably by following my own way

I could have been an engineer earning the money needed to sustain myself and my family. 

But thinking of all that, it just makes me want to either restart and make the changes or just simply kill myself and give up. But what about my sister? I can’t leave her behind! I had all the luck exploring places with my two feet unlike her and I want to be there for her. (She's got cerebral palsy)

I don’t know Singapore, I think a place on your island will soon be my grave. I have lost myself trying to make it up to you.

Maybe not this lifetime, but perhaps the next one. Thank you for making me live this far. It has been wonderful. I don’t think I have the courage to keep going on and beyond, it is very scary and I don’t have the will, drive or the energy to face it. I am a coward but a coward that did face the bull multiple times and got defeated. I die with honour."
1257,I hate my life- and not in the edgy way,"I am severely unsatisfied with my life. I'm in my fourth year of engineering at a good university, but after 3 or four semesters of failing classes it feels like graduation just gets further and further away. I've enjoyed maybe two of my classes, and when there's a spark of something I enjoy I remember why I wanted to be an engineer in the first place, but  I HATE the daily grind of the classes and feeling stupid and the constant stress that makes me too depressed to get out of bed.

I feel like I'm trapped in my life. I don't want to pursue this degree anymore because I feel like my quality of life has steadily declined over the last 3.5 years and if I need to stay an extra year like it's looking like I will, I'm genuinely concerned that I won't survive. However, I've invested 3.5 years into schooling already. I'm the first one in my family to go to college so not only is there the pressure from my parents, there's nobody in my family who really understands. The way my mom sees it, there's only one more year of hell and then I'm done with it forever.

I feel like I can't just leave school because not only will I be disappointing my family, whom I love so so much, but I also have 4 years of debt that I won't be able to pay off without a degree. My boyfriend insists that I'm not as trapped in my life as I feel like I am but the way I see it, I'm stuck here for maybe another year and a half, then 4-6 years to get my debt low enough to MAYBE pursue a career that I actually enjoy. The thought of being at a desk job that long makes me want to die. 

I feel so so trapped. I spent over an hour making two separate plans for escaping my life at this exact moment. I feel like I can't bear to live like this for another month, let alone the years I'm staring down. 

Anyway, if you actually read this, thank you. I have so much to be thankful for, but I'm so goddamn sick that I can't actually feel it."
1258,I haven’t been to school in 5 months,"it’s december and i still can’t bring myself to go to school. 
i don’t know what to do, i feel horrible for disappointing my mom"
1259,I don't want to try to be happy anymore,"The rejection, disappointment and failures have built over decades. its been slowly eating me and I don't remember enjoyment. Every month feels like forever."
1260,depression and sex,"hello there everybody. hope today you’re doing not as awful. take care of yourself. 

i’ll be brief. sex. so, the problem is i can’t go further than foreplay due to the lack of energy. my gf (we’re both girls) fully understands my condition but i see her being upset. i try to compensate for that with lots of affection but still feel guilty and faulty. i’m able to turn on and get wet but after that i’m just too tired. 

has anyone else ever faced a similar issue? did you find any compromise? thanks in advance.

p.s. for the record i don’t take any meds (can’t afford to) and for the same reason don’t go to therapy. trying to use cbt techniques in daily life but that’s pretty much it."
1262,I had a bad day,"My living situation is a mess. I‘ve been looking for a house that’s affordable for myself and my best friend. I finally thought I found one, I made a mistake of getting my hopes up entirely and didn’t stop to be realistic or calm down all the thoughts of me finally moving out. Long story short this amazing house that I found was part of a scam, I was able to figure it out before I did anything major but the ache is there. I am so f**king devastated, i mean i am just so hurt and it ruined my whole day, it just made me feel like such a failure. I’ve been dealing with a lot and This was the one thing i had hope on and it wasn’t real. I had a bad day, it’s another bad day..."
1263,Am I lazy? I don't know.,"I am a 27 dude. I've become progressively lethargic and demotivated as my life has gone on. I remember when I was young, I mean 8 or 9 and I definitely had some issues but I was proud of a lot of work that I did, I remember doing a leaflet about the lives of otters and ii drew all the otters and wrote all the facts in my best hand writing in pen with no mistakes.

Over time this started changing, I got into high school and had a difficult time socialising and making new friends, people seemed to grow up without me and I stayed the way I was in lower school. I upset some people because I was a little shit and I got my ass kicked by a popular boy, since then I never really changed.

The bullying began when I turned 14-15, I felt very small, very ugly and people said so, I was systematically humiliated and had 0 confidence, I buried my self in video games to cope.

Nothing really changed and this went on, finally I left education at 19 and trained to be a hairdresser, ii got through it, just, but ii was really unsocialised and struggled to connect with people

I quit hairdressing when I was 21 and ended up homeless, ii found a place to stay with friends but couldn't hold down work, after some bbad times we fell out and they kicked mee out.

Since then I have been homeless on and off, including times of sleeping rough. I had no idea what I was doing in my life.

Now I've taken to drinking a lot and I have smoked since I was 20, I got into drugs and did a lot of cocaine (even on myy own) which I have stopped now.

Ive messed up all my relationships with my girlfriends and my jobs, i now take care of my Grandmother full time, all my energy goes on her. The rest of the time I spend in bed, when I should be studying, I get brief moments when I feel motivated but they don't last long before I resort to bed dwelling again.

Tldr: I struggle to motivate my self to do any work, I have dreams but I feel like ill never achieve them, I've taken anti depressents before, but I'm not sure if that is the right choice for me. I know I need to find the energy to see a doctor. Not sure why I'm posting here, guess just to vent. All the best to you all."
1264,How come nobody cares about me?,"No one cares about me or what I go through. Every day I ask people how they are. Every day I listen to people’s problems. I always try and give people advice and help them. But whenever I tell anyone what I’m going through they just dismiss me. They say I’m overdramatic and ridiculous. Everyone just makes fun of me. No one takes me seriously.

I don’t have anyone in my life that I feel like I could talk to without getting judged or just dismissed. I just want someone to listen to me and not make me feel like a piece of shit for the problems I have. 

I just want to kill myself. Nobody will ever care about me or love me. Why does no one take me seriously? How come everyone just looks past me? I’m so broken and sad. How come no one cares enough to be there?"
1265,"I don't understand a lot of phrases about depression/suicide, but the one I understand least is ""you don't want to die, you just want the pain to stop"" because like.. No shit? But they're the same thing right now","I think a lot of depression ""help"" is bullshit and yes that includes on this sub. First of all anything that you're gonna say because you've heard other people say it is not the right thing to say. It just shows you can't be assed to come up with something genuine to say and that really makes us feel great. And also, we've heard it all. This includes:


""permanent solution to a temporary problem""


""it doesn't get rid of your pain it spreads it to everyone else"" (I hate this one the most but that's its own post)


""life is a gift""


""if gets better""


And last but not least


""you don't want to die, you just want the pain to stop""


I don't even understand what this phrase is trying to say. I never have. It's like.. Yeah? You're right but that doesn't mean anything. It's a stupid thing to say. You want to die BECAUSE you want the pain to stop. They're the same thing, I don't understand why you differentiate them. It's like saying ""you don't want to go to work you just want to get a paycheck.""


Yeah no shit. Thanks for the insight, I'll really ponder that for a while. If you have a way to make that happen let me know.


Yes I want the pain to stop but I also DO want to die because that's the only way to do it. If my entire 21 years of life has been utter shit, I've been suicidal since before I could make a Club Penguin account without permission, and 5 years of intense treatment has done absolutely nothing, then dying and stopping the pain are the same thing. *""You don't want to buy gas, you just want to drive.""*



Do you have a magic wand to separate the two? To fix my life and do what my best efforts and the efforts of a small army of professionals couldn't do? Because if you say this you're saying such a thing exists. Find me a solution that's literally 100% guaranteed to stop the pain like death is and then I'll understand the phrase."
1267,I wish I could dream again like I used to,"I‘ve had depression for around 10 years now. In addition social anxiety as well but most importantly insomnia. I‘ve had terrible sleep and multiple nightmares every night. 

So I got an anti-depressant that also helps me sleep. Since then (around three years) I can remember maybe one dream every couple of months, everything else is gone. I just go to sleep and wake up with no memory in between. 

But every once in a while I would have good dreams as well, that made me feel incredible. Happy, confident, strong, at ease. But that is almost completely gone. I just had a dream last night where I got my first kiss, I was so nervous in that dream but it actually felt so good! This is the first good dream in years. I just miss those because they were the only way for me to actually feel good.

I know without my medicine I could not perform in life at all and that I really need them but life still sucks so I wish I could have my happy dreams once in a while. Just to feel a little joy, love and comfort."
1268,An adult ( almost ) with no social capabilities,"I wanted to talk about something I found really hard to talk with anyone. My parents are strict,  my family grew up to be overprotective, and I grew up in that atmosphere; so, you know where  my point’s coming from .

I’m 17, and with just a few months: I’ll be 18. I used to kinda accept and understand that strict behavior that my parents bestowed upon me, but I slowly started to grow out of it and actually realize how much it affected me negatively. In my life, I have only stepped out of home 2-4 times without any supervision; and even though I was still guilted whenever I come back home by my parents; my mother specifically would always compare me to my 4 siblings who are 20+ years older than me, and definitely had it better than I’ll ever have. I’ve been feeling down ever since I opened my eyes, ever since I got isolated between 4 walls; I also, avoid participating in activities and routines, such as: Showering, working out, studying, etc.., just because I lose hope, and I always end up thinking that it doesn’t matter if I’m gonna stay isolated like this. I used to have such a good self-esteem, but now it’s on all time low; and to show you the extent of the situation, I also practiced suicide a few times in this year alone.

It’s always depressing to see my friends go out, have fun, and just be generally happy; that’s why I sometimes avoid social media just for that reason. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for them, I’m genuinely am."
1269,Not everyone hates them self?,"My depression has been getting worse that contributed to frequent bad spirals. I have an unknown hatred towards myself and wish the worst for myself to the point where I don’t bother looking after myself because I think I deserve to suffer. Recently my boyfriend mentioned that it’s not normal to hate yourself and most people who say they hate themselves don’t actually mean it.
Is this true? It doesn’t make any sense to me"
1270,What’s wrong with me?,"I cried in bed last night, dwelling on what my life would be like if I wasn’t such a failure. Now when I keep thinking about it my eyes water up. I don’t want people to worry about me or ask what’s wrong. They would just find it ridiculous, tell me to lower my standards, stop thinking about it or not being so hard on myself. Further more how am I supposed to get it through my head that I’m not meant for anything that I would consider valuable, I always end up being disappointed with myself. Right now I’m literally sitting in a meeting where I’m being coached on how to get a job. I’m so worthless and stupid that I need to have some old guy talk about all the things I should have thought about, stuff I could have figured out myself if I was actually somewhat intelligent. I am looking forward to the day when I can get out of this country and go somewhere where I can legally get a gun. Then I can sit in my room with a tool that could end all my worried in one swift painless action, contemplating whether I should pull the trigger or keep living with the little sliver of hope I have left. Because surely, I can get out of this hell right? I’ll get a happy fairytale ending right? Oh my god, just imagine sitting there in your chair in front of the computer, with your hands shaking in fear, knowing that if you give up now there is no retrying. Am I finally really to throw in the towel? Or do I want to keep lying to myself in order to maybe, some day, be happy. However it’s foolish to believe that everyone gets a happy ending because that’s not how the real world works. Not everyone gets to live happily ever after."
1272,I hate having to put on a facade,Everyday I go to school and pretend like I’m happy and everything’s good but when I come home I literally sit there alone or sob in my bed. Most of the troubles I have stems from different things but at the same time being someone I’m not seems to make it a lot worse than it already is. I’d feel really uncomfortable if anyone knew me for I really am but I can’t do both: anybody knowing about this and at the same time keep splitting myself in two just to keep my insecurity at a low.
1273,"If I can overcome the bullshit in my life, so can you (18M), If you're reading this, I want you to focus on the good in your life rather than the bad, stop thinking about everything that has you down, think about what you have to look forward to. Focus on bettering yourself, do what makes you happy.","I won't get too in to detail but I wasn't liked much as a kid/teen and in a good way it helped me grow up and come to understand people better. In past years I used to have crazy anxiety over it, my mood swings were all over the place, one day I was confident, the next I was timid and was scared to talk to people because I was scared they wouldn't like me. Honestly I'm thankful for everything that's happened in my life, as much as I would like to say I'd like to redo everything, I wouldn't. I believe everything in life happens for a reason. Even though I felt lonely, lost and wasn't sure who I was anymore, it helped shape me as a person. People who barely knew me were judging me because of other kids were talking about me behind my back, calling me stupid and ""retarded"". It crushed my self confidence and honestly I hated myself, it wasn't until a year ago that I started loving myself, and over the past year, my confidence, my anxiety, honestly everything has changed. I wasn't hated by everyone at the school by any means, but my reputation was pretty much just me being a loser. As much as I want to say my past is behind me, it isn't and it's affecting my present.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year was Grade 12 for me or year 12, and every year before that I kept telling myself throughout high school that I would start trying in grade 11, prior to that I did no work, and was just passing my classes. My depression got the best of me and I started skipping, a lot. At one point I skipped for 3 weeks straight, it got to the point where I was so unmotivated and sad I just couldn't get out of bed in the morning. It was only when I got a call home saying that if I didn't go to school I was going to be kicked out. I ended up failing grade 12. I don't find school hard by any means, but my work ethic is awful and I'm scared for what the future has in store for me. This year I'm back doing another year of grade 12, and I just want to say that from the start of this school year to now, I haven't felt happier. I've been focusing on me, what I need in my life, cutting out the toxicity, I do feel lonely sometimes, but I know when I put myself back out there I'll find the group of kids I'm looking for, that's something I'm looking forward to in university/college. Anyways I feel like I'm all over the place here, my point is all my bad habits are getting the best of me, and I want to know how to just overcome lack of motivation and just do it. I know that question will vary from person to person as everyone is different, but I guess I'm desperate.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a gf of 4 months, we've been great friends for around 8 months. She's quite possibly the most amazing girl/person I could have asked for. We shared a class together, before we became friends a friend of mine was cracking jokes to her that I was going to ask her to prom, quite honestly the best thing he's done for me even though he obviously had all the wrong intentions. Later that night she texted me and that was when we started talking. I already had a crush on her, not that anyone knew that. Honestly I admired her, she was funny, easy to talk to, funny, cute, extremely likable, smart, and kind. I love this girl with all my heart and she has no idea what kind of great impact she's had on my life. I've never been happier and I'm not going to say it's all thanks to her, but she's definitely got a part in it. Anyways we talked for a great while, and all people did was make fun of her, but slowly but surely her close friends were accepting of it, and here we are. One thing that's always bugged me about our relationship is how secretive of it she is. She doesn't want me commenting on her social media (She wouldn't be mad or anything if I did, but she'd prefer if I didn't) because she doesn't want kids from high school to see it, not that she's ashamed of me but she doesn't like being judged because of it. Honestly can I even blame her, the one thing I've been trying to do is better myself, my mental health is great, I'm not the kid I used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I've been trying to do is better myself like I said before. The saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger applies a lot to my life. Well all anything in my life has done, is make my skin thicker, I don't care anywhere near as much what other people think of me. I mean I do a little, but everyone cares to an extent, if you say otherwise you're lying. I've pretty much changed my entire wardrobe. The thing was I cared too little about what other people thought about me, I stopped caring about everything in general, and the fact that this girl saw through all my flaws and still dated me makes me love her that much more. Anyways one thing I want to do for myself is get really fit. I just want to look great, not for anyone's opinion to change, but almost as a big fuck you. Who the fuck are you to judge me, try judging me now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know everything I need to do, it's just a matter of doing it. I just feel so lost because I have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life, I don't want to just pick a career and settle for it. I want to do something I enjoy, the problem is my interests change all the time. One moment I love something, the next second I don't care anymore. I've also been pissing away this year again, I'm currently doing a victory lap or pretty much grade 12 again, and honestly I've barely done anything and I'm mad at myself, I'm tired of blaming everything on my past. I'm tired of getting mad at my parents and telling them they wouldn't understand. Essentially I'm tired of feeling bad for myself. It's time for me to get my life together, I'm going to make everyone in my life proud. I'm going to start off by making a schedule, I'm going to follow that schedule, I'm also going to make days for my gf to come hang out with me, other than that I'm going to focus on school rn. It's time for me to follow a schedule for once in my life. I don't even know why I'm going to post this because I've pretty much made a plan for myself right here. I guess I just needed to rant and be clear everything up for myself because whether I like to admit it or not, sometimes I don't realize why I'm upset until late at night when I'm alone and have time to think clearly without any distractions.

&amp;#x200B;

I focused too much on trying to please other people and not enough on myself. If I could go back in time I would try and set myself straight. Throughout my entire life my priorities have been totally wrong. I wish I could've told myself that what these kids thought of me doesn't matter. I'm thankful that I decided to write this, I feel much better and am thinking clearer, I'm not feeling sorry for myself. All I know is I'm not going to take shit from anyone anymore."
1274,Jesus Christ I want to die,"I feel like I’ve gone off the rails. Suicide is always on my mind even though I don’t necessarily act on it. My antidepressants make me feel like shit over and over because I can’t stay on them long enough. I stopped taking them entirely and I’ve been on the same bottle for four months even though they’re supposed to be refilled every month. I am not good enough for them, I don’t deserve them, so they’ll just be sitting there. I have zero idea how long I can hold out but I’m always thinking about walking into traffic, leaning just a little too far out the window, pushing the gas pedal a little harder than necessary, leaving a candle lit by the fan. Little things that would look “accidental.” 

I cry myself to sleep every night out of sheer despair and isolation and hate waking up. My social worker abandoned me after saying she’d help me find therapy and I haven’t heard from her in months. I never got any help. If literal professionals don’t care, it’s safe to say no one else does. Plus dying would take care of my student loans. No one would have to go into more crippling debt to help me pay them off. Who doesn’t want to not be a burden? I’m supposed to graduate in six months but don’t care anymore. I applied to grad school already but I’m not confident I’ll get that far.

Fuck. Maybe I’ll die in an accident."
1275,Missing school,"I'm not sure why I'm creating this post. I've been suffering from a nuerological disorder since I was a teenager, though doctors have never been able to give a specific diagnosis. 3 Years ago i entered a PhD program. I want to teach one day and school really means everything to me. This is the 3rd semester in a row I've been in too much pain and forced to stay away from my school work. It kills me to see everyone so happy at christmas and to get snapchats from my friends complaining about their exams.  I would kill to worry about exams. I just want to go back to school."
1276,Any free online help for the depressed?,"I'm from West Africa and believe me, no one cares about the depressed over here. I don't even think they believe it's a thing. Joining this sub really let me know I'm actually depressed. I've kind of always known (From suicide attempts, to being mocked a sadist cause I'm never happy, to substance abuse, and weekly cries and just plain hating being alive), but never thought it was mental illness till I read the description of this sub and connected with a lot of posts. I really have no one to talk to, and I know I need help. And I can't get the help without money (which I so so do not have). I'm a 25 y/o, unemployed, unmotivated slob, still living at home and abandoned by everyone, because I can't get my shit in order, which this sub let me realize is because I'm depressed. And online research let me know I have adult ADD. All things no one in my country ever talks about or even knows about. Trust me, the majority of people here will say I need prayers and deliverance instead. 

I really need to open up to someone that can help me out. I need therapy. Found better help through the app I'm using to stay sober, but it's not free. Any free options out there?

I feel this sub can be considered as one, but I don't know where to start from. I've created really long posts about my life trying to get help, but they get posted, just never visible to the sub it's posted to. I'll only see it in my profile posts. Maybe because it's too long. I add TL;DR, but still nothing. So maybe I need professional help."
1277,"If I can overcome the bullshit in my life, so can you (18M), If you're reading this, I want you to focus on the good in your life rather, stop thinking about everything that has you down, think about what you have to look forward to. Focus on bettering yourseld, do what makes you happy.","I won't get too in to detail but I wasn't liked much as a kid/teen and in a good way it helped me grow up and come to understand people better. In past years I used to have crazy anxiety over it, my mood swings were all over the place, one day I was confident, the next I was timid and was scared to talk to people because I was scared they wouldn't like me. Honestly I'm thankful for everything that's happened in my life, as much as I would like to say I'd like to redo everything, I wouldn't. I believe everything in life happens for a reason. Even though I felt lonely, lost and wasn't sure who I was anymore, it helped shape me as a person. People who barely knew me were judging me because of other kids were talking about me behind my back, calling me stupid and ""retarded"". It crushed my self confidence and honestly I hated myself, it wasn't until a year ago that I started loving myself, and over the past year, my confidence, my anxiety, honestly everything has changed. I wasn't hated by everyone at the school by any means, but my reputation was pretty much just me being a loser. As much as I want to say my past is behind me, it isn't and it's affecting my present. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year was Grade 12 for me or year 12, and every year before that I kept telling myself throughout high school that I would start trying in grade 11, prior to that I did no work, and was just passing my classes. My depression got the best of me and I started skipping, a lot. At one point I skipped for 3 weeks straight, it got to the point where I was so unmotivated and sad I just couldn't get out of bed in the morning. It was only when I got a call home saying that if I didn't go to school I was going to be kicked out. I ended up failing grade 12. I don't find school hard by any means, but my work ethic is awful and I'm scared for what the future has in store for me. This year I'm back doing another year of grade 12, and I just want to say that from the start of this school year to now, I haven't felt happier. I've been focusing on me, what I need in my life, cutting out the toxicity, I do feel lonely sometimes, but I know when I put myself back out there I'll find the group of kids I'm looking for, that's something I'm looking forward to in university/college. Anyways I feel like I'm all over the place here, my point is all my bad habits are getting the best of me, and I want to know how to just overcome lack of motivation and just do it. I know that question will vary from person to person as everyone is different, but I guess I'm desperate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a gf of 4 months, we've been great friends for around 8 months. She's quite possibly the most amazing girl/person I could have asked for. We shared a class together, before we became friends a friend of mine was cracking jokes to her that I was going to ask her to prom, quite honestly the best thing he's done for me even though he obviously had all the wrong intentions. Later that night she texted me and that was when we started talking. I already had a crush on her, not that anyone knew that. Honestly I admired her, she was funny, easy to talk to, funny, cute, extremely likable, smart, and kind. I love this girl with all my heart and she has no idea what kind of great impact she's had on my life. I've never been happier and I'm not going to say it's all thanks to her, but she's definitely got a part in it. Anyways we talked for a great while, and all people did was make fun of her, but slowly but surely her close friends were accepting of it, and here we are. One thing that's always bugged me about our relationship is how secretive of it she is. She doesn't want me commenting on her social media (She wouldn't be mad or anything if I did, but she'd prefer if I didn't) because she doesn't want kids from high school to see it, not that she's ashamed of me but she doesn't like being judged because of it. Honestly can I even blame her, the one thing I've been trying to do is better myself, my mental health is great, I'm not the kid I used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I've been trying to do is better myself like I said before. The saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger applies a lot to my life. Well all anything in my life has done, is make my skin thicker, I don't care anywhere near as much what other people think of me. I mean I do a little, but everyone cares to an extent, if you say otherwise you're lying. I've pretty much changed my entire wardrobe. The thing was I cared too little about what other people thought about me, I stopped caring about everything in general, and the fact that this girl saw through all my flaws and still dated me makes me love her that much more. Anyways one thing I want to do for myself is get really fit. I just want to look great, not for anyone's opinion to change, but almost as a big fuck you. Who the fuck are you to judge me, try judging me now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know everything I need to do, it's just a matter of doing it. I just feel so lost because I have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life, I don't want to just pick a career and settle for it. I want to do something I enjoy, the problem is my interests change all the time. One moment I love something, the next second I don't care anymore. I've also been pissing away this year again, I'm currently doing a victory lap or pretty much grade 12 again, and honestly I've barely done anything and I'm mad at myself, I'm tired of blaming everything on my past. I'm tired of getting mad at my parents and telling them they wouldn't understand. Essentially I'm tired of feeling bad for myself. It's time for me to get my life together, I'm going to make everyone in my life proud. I'm going to start off by making a schedule, I'm going to follow that schedule, I'm also going to make days for my gf to come hang out with me, other than that I'm going to focus on school rn. It's time for me to follow a schedule for once in my life. I don't even know why I'm going to post this because I've pretty much made a plan for myself right here. I guess I just needed to rant and be clear everything up for myself because whether I like to admit it or not, sometimes I don't realize why I'm upset until late at night when I'm alone and have time to think clearly without any distractions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I focused too much on trying to please other people and not enough on myself. If I could go back in time I would try and set myself straight. Throughout my entire life my priorities have been totally wrong. I wish I could've told myself that what these kids thought of me doesn't matter. I'm thankful that I decided to write this, I feel much better and am thinking clearer, I'm not feeling sorry for myself. All I know is I'm not going to take shit from anyone anymore."
1278,"Trapped in a town I hate, can't leave at least til the spring.","I'm 7 hours from anyone who cares about me.  I work graveyards at a job that barely pays minimum wage for my state.  My car's broken down and has been for over a year, though I should finally have enough money set aside to make strides towards getting it running again the 20th of this month.

I took two people off of craigslist this last year as roommates because I'd lost my job in May of last year and it took til November 28thish of that year to finally get another one, and it paid once a month, so ultimately I didn't have a real check til almost February and by then...

well, let's just say I had roommate 2 for about six months and he sort of paid rent for two of them, along with eating much of my food, getting me 3 months behind on the utilities, and generally being a leech.  So much for trusting that someone in the military would have good moral code and be an upstanding person.

Had quite a few friends backstab me in life, usually to women I'm the guy they ""befriend only to speak to when they want something and then generally forget about me, my parents and brothers mostly ignore me since they're highly conservative Lutherans and I'm atheistic and out and have been for at least 20 years...have depression and anxiety and ptsd from when I lived in my van and got jumped while walking back to it one day, along with someone trying to rob me by gunpoint while I was sleeping in said van.

I do wish I'd've lived by the river, just once, just to live out the Farley experience.

Like him, I try to mask my pain with humor.

But in spite of the good I've tried to give out into the world by taking in worthless roommates who didn't deserve it or create a unique tv show concept that would've given people jobs if we had more time to work on it, had money to put into it, and the network we were trying for didn't die months after we put the idea together... I still can't shake the feeling that all this strife and struggle hasn't been worth it.

How , in the biggest city I've ever lived in, can I feel so alone?

In 4 years here, I still haven't made any friends."
1279,"It’s not a matter of “if”, it’s a matter of “when”.","Please don’t jump to conclusions. This is just a rant. I’m not at the ledge yet. I just have no one to talk to.

I think about it all the time. Several times a day. From the moment I wake up. Stay up late thinking about it. On especially dark days I obsess. I’ve done my research. I’m ironing out the details- even the after care to make sure no one has to deal with me too much. 

I don’t know when it changed from “maybe I should” to “I will”.  That scares me a bit. I don’t know when, but I know it’s true down in my core. 

People say it’s a permanent answer to a temporary problem. But, my problems have always been there- they will never go away. Some say it’s impulsive, but it seems calculated. People say it’s selfish, but where were those people when I was homeless? Were they mourning when I traded my body for a place to sleep? Did they grieve when they tossed me aside to be abused? Did they shed a tear when they saw me destroying myself to show that I needed help? Did they give me a moment of silence when I slipped through every crack and safety net as a child, too young to speak for myself? I was invisible. Always have been.

It’s slowly taken over. That nagging feeling. When I look into the future I don’t see anything. If you’ve read this far, I’m calling the doctor tomorrow. I don’t trust them and they’ve failed me before, but I figured that I might as well as a courtesy to say I tried."
1280,Depression is part of me,"I feel as if I have always had traits that were negative, and now I feel as if depression is a part of me and who I am."

1282,Wish there was some way for me to go without hurting my family,"I don’t think it’s because I “don’t have the guts to do it” or whatever. I’ve had a health issue for some time that has ruined my life. I’ve seen a number of doctors and specialists and time again am given false hope. These past few years I’ve been living vicariously through the eventual me without this health issue...the day that I’m free of this. But I’m starting to doubt that day will come.

Still living at home at 24 because of it. Just existing, not really doing anything else, so it can frustrate my parents. I don’t blame them, I don’t like it either, but if only they knew that I’m just trying to save them the emotional distress...because I know they do care for me.

Bit of a dump of a rant."
1283,I honestly don't know why I'm still alive because I want to die so badly.,"I was always a sad person, but never truly felt depressed until a two years ago. Nothing was going well for me and I decided, ""Fuck it I'm gonna get really drunk and pull the trigger because it's for the best anyways."" Before I was able to leave my house with my gun, my father began to beat my mother and threatened to kill her. This was unusual because although they would argue, he wouldn't lay a hand on my mom. I ran over to grab him off her and he pulled out his gun and threaten to kill me and her. As he turned and looked at my mom, I pulled out the gun I was leaving with and shot him in the head. All I heard was my mother's scream and saw my dad's lifeless body on the floor. 

I haven't been able to sleep well, i feel like I'm losing my sanity, and it's so hard to interact with people because I feel like everyone looks at me in fear or disgust. There's times I've been called a monster and a murderer by people who ended up disliking me and using it against me or people who don't care about the situation. I hate myself so much and I feel like all of this eats at me so much and I'm just fighting a losing battle. I pay the bills for my mom and brothers and that's probably the only reason I stay alive right now. But it gets harder and harder everyday and I honestly don't think I can keep up with it anymore and I don't know what else to do at this point. 

I'm not asking for pity or anything, I just wanted someone to listen. I don't want to be a monster."
1284,I Can't Fix My Life No Matter How Hard I Try,"I'm a 24 year old guy working a dead end job with no college education or future prospects. I have barely any friends and I'm also a virgin who hasn't so much as held hand or kissed a girl even. I don't get along with my family whatsoever and had an older brother who would emotionally abuse me my whole childhood and a shitty father and I don't have any interest in speaking with them. I don't have the energy or willpower to move to do anything productive. I've tried everything and I'm at my ends now.

My whole life it felt like I was just been going through the motions, on autopilot with fog clouding up my brain and there wasn't much that made me happy or glad to be alive. I dropped out of college after 2 weeks and just started sitting in my dorm for the rest of the semester playing videogames and eating pizza and cheeseburgers. After that, I went to live in a tiny apartment with my family and began working deadend jobs and continue being depressed. I soon realized that I needed to make some changes and began to try everything I could think of to break out of this spell.

I began trying different SSRI's from the doctors in hopes that they would help with my depression but all they did was make me numb and get no joy from anything anymore even music which was pretty much the only thing that could make me happy. I still feel that taking those had some long term effects on me where it's harder to feel joy now but idk. After that I tried going to the gym and eating well, I did this for about a year and was still depressed and eventually stopped. 

At this point, I knew living with my family in their tiny apartment wasn't helping. I moved into an apartment with a couple of friends and was able to start doing some things again. I began cooking a lot and started eating a lot of rice, chicken, and fish + fruits and greek yogurt mostly. I started to read about psychology and just how the mind works but with a specific interest in the habit loop. I planned to use this knowledge to break some of my negative habits and form positive ones in their place but I've had trouble applying it. I started to do yoga and read a lot more and I felt myself gradually getting better it felt like. This whole time the debt from my college experience and my car loan were too much for me to handle and I just started ignoring the debt collectors as I tend to go back in my shell and ignore problems when they're too much for me.

While living with my friends, I took acid a few times and it changed my whole perspective on life. I started to spend a lot of time working on electronic music I bought a guitar and it felt like my life had purpose now and something to work towards. This invigoration lasted about a year and then eventually I just felt all my creativity and will to live disappear again at which point I started taking DXM occasionally. It feels like I need to be high on something or I can't be happy or creative.

About a year and a half ago I got formally diagnosed with ADD and began taking adderall to help with my concentration. Again, I felt completely reinvigorated and began to find joy in being productive. I completely stopped playing videogames and started spending that time learning web development, music production, astrophysics, philosophy, geometry and just anything that interested me. Eventually my motivation quit on me again. I started to feel a lack of progress, I tried to work through it with journaling but to no avail. That happened around March of this year and I haven't been able to do one productive thing since and I quit the adderall after 2 months of it not working. 

I became good online friends with a trans girl on the other side of the world about 9 months ago. For 3 or 4 months we would play video games together or just talk for 8-14 hours every single day. She would tell me all about her deepest secrets and we would vent to each other and I really enjoyed spending time with someone for once. I haven't been that intimate with someone since a girl I had feelings for in high school. Anyway we gradually stopped spending as much time together and I would make her feel guilty for it and kind of be mean to her for wanting to spend time with anyone else. She put up with it for awhile but after a few months she just kind of is over the bullshit and blocks me for a few days if I do anything a little toxic. I developed feelings for her but she doesn't feel the same way about me and it's really hard for me to just be her friend. I got into obsessively seeing what she was up to and kinda estalking her I guess and being mean to her when she spends time with anyone else. and I hate that I can't stop myself from doing that. I don't know how I'll ever be able to form a real relationship with someone when I know I'll just be obsessive and creepy and toxic if things don't go my way. I've done this to any girl I've gotten feelings for that talks to me back and I hate that I can't just be chill.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I really don't. I've tried therapy. I've tried all sorts of medication. I've tried exercising and eating healthy. I've tried developing hobbies that give me joy. I've tried to get close to people but anyone I get close to I'll just be toxic to. I eat like shit right now, I don't have the energy to cook or go to the grocery store and just order food every day. I don't clean. All I do is sit and play videogames with high school friends or the trans girl all day and wait for her to want to talk to me. I don't have any motivation to do anything. I can't fix my life and I'm not sure what else to do at this point. I just can't be consistent. 

What am I supposed to do? I don't think I'll ever be happy at this point. I've tried as hard as I can to fix my problems but they won't go away. I probably have some underlying personality disorders from how I treat people or maybe some kind of form of OCD from some other things I do but I can't really afford therapy and when I've tried there's been 0 progress. The only thing I think that could make me happy is having a girlfriend that makes me want to be better for her but I can't imagine even getting one in my current state or anytime soon and everyone just would see me as pathetic with my lack of experience. I just don't know what to do. I have too many issues and it feels like every every step I take forward I take two steps back."
1285,I've been depressed since I was 14. I'm 23 now and things are much worse.,"Its almost been a decade, and I've held onto hope that things will get better. I've actively tried to improve my life, but things now are getting to the point where I feel hopeless. I've pushed all my friends away, and working a dead end job for the rest of my life seems  like a fate worse than death. I've been through multiple therapists, been in the psych ward, rehab for 6 months. Nothing has helped. Things get better for a short time, then come crashing down again as always. Whats the point in trying again only to have things come crashing down again. At 14 I didn't have to worry about paying bills and surviving. At 23 I see people who used to be my friends graduating from college, getting married, going on to graduate school. And here I am this 23 year old loser with no friends and deep resentment and jealousy for people moving on and having happy lives. I want to give up."
1286,Birthday blues,"So I’m turning 22 and for the past 5 years or so, I’ve had birthday blues. This is kinda due to a variety of reasons like people forgetting my birthday because it falls right before the holidays and me getting my heart broken right around my birthday. If as time has any experience with this or any advice, I’d really appreciate it. I’m exhausted of being sad on my birthday. It’s not like I’m dating anyone this year. People actually remember this year. It’s just hard to shake off the past. I’m usually great at dealing with my anxiety and occasional depression bits but On my birthday, that just fucking disappears lol. So any advice is appreciated. Thanks for reading."
1287,so lost lol,"i wish i had something i was passionate about, or even something i was semi good at so i could at the very least fake a passion for.  i feel so lost and without direction, and like there's nothing out there for me. this is when the depression hits, and so follows the suicide ideation. its just a sense of ""whats the point."" leaving me with a questionable urge that I've surprisingly gotten really good at fighting off on my own this past year. im okay now, this isnt a cry for help, just me venting about this feeling that comes and goes. the only thing i kinda like to do is writing, but what am i supposed to do with that? im total ass at it and dont do it enough to improve anyway. the way im feeling right now is that im just simply existing, waiting until the timer decides to go off. i know it comes with being in my early 20s. i know a lot of people feel this way. i just dont know where to go from here. how do i get shit together when there's nothing, no drive to keep me going, nothing to work towards? its hard and fuck i feel panicky about life :)))"
1288,I don’t know what I’m doing anymore,"It’s 3:00 am, I’m a 17 year old male, I have finals today so I’m beyond stressed out and my antidepressants haven’t been working for the past two weeks, I feel under appreciated both at home and at work. I also feel unloved and lonely. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel as though the people around me don’t care and don’t love me despite what I tell them so out of desperation I’ve decided to come here. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I have no idea what to do in order to help myself. Even now while writing this I feel as though I’m bothering the people in this community because I don’t even know if my problem can be categorized as depression. I’m just lost. Any response is welcomed at this point."
1289,I washed my hair for the first time in a month,"It seems like such a small accomplishment but to me it's huge. I'm finally picking myself up. I stopped smoking pot, I'm got medication and it's working. I don't want to die, today, and it amazes me. I've had suicidal thoughts everyday for years but now it's starting to go away and it's an incredible feeling. Guys, take care of yourselves. I didn't think it was possible to heal after 8 years of intense depression and suicidal thoughts, yet here I am, feeling better than I have in years. If it's possible for me, after all I've been through, it's also possible for you. I still have low points, not gonna lie, but the difference is that now, sometimes, I no longer feel my depression, and I'm happy. I'm happy right now, guys. It's incredible."
1290,I'm so tired.,"The last six or so years of my life have bee shit. My paternal grandparents got arrested for sex offenses, maternal grandmother died, my paternal great grandpa died, my favorite dog ever died, and my school life has spiraled into a pit. I can't fucking take it anymore. Nobody appreciates me. Nobody cares anymore. My best friend told me I was annoying and makes everything depressed. He doesn't want to talk to me anymore and he's basically the only person I have outside of my house that I can talk to anymore. I constantly think of suicide, and when I told my mom about it and told her I wanted to be admitted to a psych hospital, she told me to just go to therapy. I can't fucking do this anymore. I'm so fucking tired. I feel trapped by my own skin. I just want to die. I just want to feel happy again."
1291,Today is my cake day.,"So.. exactly 1 year ago I made a reddit account to look at depressive memes. I remember first subreddits I've joined were r/depression, r/2meirl4meirl and r/depression_memes.

Even tho I have been depressed my whole life, I was hoping in 1 year I'll get better. Well I didn't. I've been struggling with depression for at least 6 years if I remember correctly, maybe even more. (I'm 16).

I am honestly so destroyed because my hamster died 4 days ago. I loved him so much and I still love him and I am not sure if I want to get another hamster, because he will die too and I'll only be sadder.

I hate winters. All bad things happen in winter. I made this account for depressive memes because in December 2018 I broke with my ex-boyfriend. In 1 year I haven't improved at all. I thought life would be better. It wasn't only in these winters, the first time I've cut myself was in winter (2016). All winters are bad and harsh. 

I have tried therapy but it honestly didn't help. My parents don't help either. I honestly don't know what to do to fill the void. Someone told me the answer is pets, but they keep dying. Nothing makes me happy anymore, I lost motivation and interest in everything I had so far."
1292,Bad at being BAD AND GOOD,"I've never been the smartest, and I may have been the worst; however, I think I've been like one or two spaces above ”worst” because I would put in the effort (often ) even if that hardly worked out. It's so weird, and kind of discouraging. Like, in math class: id listen or try to, but I still wouldn't get it. I went to at least one tutoring session-didn't help- and attempt to consult teachers and their helpers, but still not understand. Yet, my efforts and partial understanding of other things made people think I was smart so they could mock and use me, or I always expected good grades and was just being inconsiderate and downplaying my obvious success. 
 I'm not really good at anything. I'm not really good looking. In fat, I have no figure. I don't have good social skills, and people usually don't like me. And im slowly spiraling in part from the loneliness. I don't think there's much tonlok forward to for someone like me, someone who doesn't socialize well enough for other people. Thanks for reading."
1293,I have no one to text silly thoughts or memes,"A friend took me for granted and I realized it was an unhealthy relationship, no matter how much humor or interests we shared.

Now I don't have anyone to fill that spot.

It only makes my depression 10 times worse."
1294,People who aren’t depressed are bad at helping with depression because they don’t put the effort in to understand it,"I appreciate it when people try to offer me help, but it is clear that they have no idea what they are talking about. All they do is give me meaningless words of encouragement and act like that’s going to give me a new perspective on life. It doesn’t. I know that they genuinely want to help, but when you pretend you know all the answers to my problems, I am probably not going to take you seriously. Depending on my mood you could actually make me even more mad when you try to cheer me up instead of actually listening to me. Honestly, it just takes a little bit of research to get somewhat of a better understanding of what I am going through. Depression isn’t just being sad all the time, it’s more complicated than that."
1295,“You can’t survive without me.”,"My mom told me this today while I was helping her apply for a job.

Thinking on it, I can’t survive on my own. She brought up instances in the past where I was able to do things on my own and she told me I couldn’t do them now. She’s right.

I don’t belong in this world. I have nothing to contribute but negativity. I break myself trying to succeed and I fail every time. I never became an adult. I will amount to nothing."
1296,"I need your help. I know exactly what i need to do and what i want from my life, but have no motivation to do anything.","So, I have been wondering for quite some time if i have some sort of a mental illness. Either ADD or depression.
I wanted to ask reddit's opinion first to see if its necessary to go talk to a professional.

I have been coping my issues with lack of motivation with various drugs for a long time, including nicotine, caffeine, microdosing lsd, amphetamine etc. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesnt. And when the effects wear off its back to my normal state.

I have created a list of habits to improve my life, I know what kind of a career i want to pursue etc. 

The issue is, i cannot initiate any sort of action to do these things. That makes me feel helpless. 

My memory is very poor and my attention as well.

Recently ive lost my libido and I dont really find enjoyment from anything anymore. 

I dont want to get out of bed in the morning, I want to exercise but i cannot bring myself to do it. My thoughts also feel disorganized and when i talk i often cannot seem to find the right words.

I dont feel sad, Ive got will to live and have high hopes for the future and have no suicidal thoughts.

Its just the lack of interest and motivation to do the things I want to do to improve my life seems impossible.

Could I have ADD, depression or even both? Ive done tests online and they point in that direction.

The following options i have discovered: CBT, SSRI medication, or ADD medication. Are these worth it in your opinion?

Id really appreciate responses, and thank you very much in advance if someone replies."

1298,d,"Starting a new job, getting a massive hike in pay, got a scholarship for an awesome course, got an endorsement. Working out everyday, eating healthy, seeing friends regularly. So why do I want to die? Feel like I have no one, feel like I am going around in circles. I see no point in living; whilst seeing that I logically have a lot to live for.

I'm so afraid of being alone, but it's all I ever feel. A deep loneliness, even in the most crowded rooms I feel lost.

Why am I here again; when will it get better"
1299,This Helped Me Rip Up My Suicide Note,"Hello 

let me start by saying you're not alone, and at the end of the day the decision to live is your choice and no one else's. With this being said, I recently was suicidally depressed and wrote out a suicide note; life was meaningless (and still maybe is) and i was full of nihilism despite going to therapy and getting good grades at University and being part of a social fraternity.  I didn't want to live, and being quite honest there is a part of me that still doesn't; that hardly changes. BUT what helped me was listening to Jordan Peterson -a clinical psychologist/philosopher and prof. at Toronto Uni-. I highly suggest any one who is confused about why the fuck we're here to look up one of his hundreds of videos on Youtube and try your best to really concentrate and think about what he's saying ( he's quite sophisticated and complex). I don't want to preach and be the type of guy that says this is a ""quick fix"" or ""life changing"", but for me his words hit deep and it was honestly reassuring listening to someone like him admit that life is hard and mostly suffering but it's how you respond which makes it meaningful.  I hope i can could help anyone who wants/needs it.

BTW: To all the Jordan Peterson Fans, I knew of him way earlier (2015 or so) and got my life on track (so i'm not new to the rodeo nor trying to start a new ""fad""), but after ""cleaning my room"" and ""standing tall with my shoulders back"" i got comfortable and slumped back into mediocrity ... I have learned a valuable lesson about continuing to strive for greatness even when you're doing fine.

Good Luck Everyone, and God Speed (if you believe in God lol)

TLDR: Look up Jordan Peterson"
1300,Just want to say I love you all,I struggle with depression often and I just want to say thank you to all of for making me not feel alone. Life is shitty and I just get so tired of all the bullshit that comes with it sometimes. I would never kill myself but often I wish I could just die because it would relieve me of this feeling. It’s comforting to know that so many people are going through the same shit. There are many times when I feel so alone even if I’m around friends or family. I just feel so detached from people and I feel like everyone hate me sometimes. I just want to say I’m thankful for all of you and that you are not alone. Everyone is so separated these days but we need to remember that we are all closer than we think. We are all conmected. Everyone has experienced the same feelings. Don’t let life distract you from the fact that we are all connected with the universe. Sorry if I’m rambling all over the place. But just know that I love you all.
1301,"I have been very down since I saw this post, how can someone say something so low?","I came across and I am sorry to bring this up but I had to, I was very hurt how this person portrait us fighters or survivors , TDLR... if you have depression you are a pussy if you take pills, please elaborate on this and how it makes you feel, it makes me feel like absolute shit  [https://livestreamfails.com/post/68550](https://livestreamfails.com/post/68550)"
1302,I have been relying on someone and I fucked up. Then I ghosted them.,"I’m a senior in high school. I’ve hated myself more and more since my junior year but I only motivated myself because of one person. A dear friend of mine, she was my sole reason to try. I swear, the only reason I made it through the past year was because of her. I didn’t think I would have been able to get out of bed every morning if not for her. I wouldn’t have eaten, worked, or exercised if not for her. All she had to do was be in my presence, and I would feel happiness. I didn’t cry myself to sleep because I would fantasize about life together, in the future. I guess I only cared about myself because I felt I had to be the best for her. She never knew any of this. 

I had always thought I was asexual or just had a really low sex drive. I had never been interested in girls, dating, etc. and I’ve only had what I can describe as light crushes. Barely even that. This person made me feel feelings I didn’t even know existed. When you would do anything for them, and you just can’t stop thinking of them. We played video games together, watched movies. Hung out, developed inside jokes, made memories. I grew more and more attracted to her over my junior year. 

I confessed my feelings four months ago. You can guess how it went. I respect her wishes. But I felt horrible that she had to deal with me now. So I ghosted her. I want her to forget about me so that I’m not even a bad memory anymore. I remember in the following weeks waking up, crying, having just terrible, awful dreams. I sometimes just ran, at times like 2am as far as I could before I collapsed from exhaustion. I despised myself and punished my body.

My parents didn’t care. Of course they wouldn’t. I hardly think they see me as anything more than test scores and trophies. I told my mom, but all she said boiled down to “ignore it and study, or I’ll send you to a psychiatrist.” She told my dad and he even mocked me for it when we got into a heated argument, and it was out of nowhere. I punched a hole in the wall and left for a while and slept at a friend’s place. I guess that is all I need to say about them.

I’ve been functioning, but that’s it. I do my work. When I’m with my friends at school, I try to act normally. I crack jokes and talk. But when I get home, I’m a fucking mess. I’m practically fueled by self hate right now. I work out to extreme pain or I sleep for 12 hours. I eat tons of shit food or starve a while. I often think ending my life but I also know that I shouldn’t. Every time I have a flash of considering suicide, it scares me. I’m scared one day I’m going to have the conviction to just end it.

It doesn’t help that I have so many constant reminders of her. One of her favorite songs playing, a mention of a show or movie we watched, or even the fucking mention of one of her pastimes, it feels like someone’s choking me. I don’t remember a day that’s gone by where I haven’t cried over her. Completely unrequited love. Complete fucking loser fucking idiot fuck I hate myself I just want to go back three years to the last time I remember I felt genuine happiness. I’ve never told anyone this. I took this old account to get some shit off my chest and put my broken unorganized crying mess of a confession somewhere out there. I don’t even know what I’m doing or want anymore."
1303,"Let's just be honest and say nobody on here can care about anyone else here in the way they say. You don't even know me. You care about depressed people as a group, not me individually.","You don't know me. I could be a literal serial killer for all you know. It's not possible to care about somebody you don't know. Maybe I'm just a really well made bot account, shit. You might hate my guts and want me to kill myself if you met me.


You say you care about me because you're a good person who reaches out to mentally ill people, not because you care about ME. you care about everyone here equally just out of principle and that isn't the same thing. Not nearly as comforting because I'm not unique.


So don't say it's ok I don't have friends because I have you, please. It still isn't ok. Sorry but you can't do anything about me being utterly alone in life. Having no friends or family whatsoever, only talking to screen names. It isn't the same thing. You CAN'T care about me like you say, nothing against you it just literally isn't possible."
1304,I just feel so alone,"The fact that the story I’m about to tell you is so cliche is honestly a factor in my depression, it all started when I met my first love of my life when I was 16, I met this incredible,interesting, a bit sexually overwhelming but still amazing girl, I smoked weed for the first time and we shared a beautiful relationship for about 2 years, until things ended up ugly and she left me, I blame us both, soon after we broke up I found out that she was cheating on me throughout our entire relationship, that alone broke me...
About 8 months later I met a young woman who was so lovely, at the time she completely restored me, and me being overly egotistical I didn’t think my last relationship fucked me up too bad it was until this current relationship ended in flames from her cheating on me multiple times, for me to realize love doesn’t exist the way I imagined it would."
1305,A poem I wrote about a guy I dated with depression,"Just wanted somewhere to put it.-

25 hours

he says our first date was perfect;
despite all of my nerves.

he thinks he is too complicated;
but I say it’s fine to be reserved.

dating is a funny thing;
scary and beautiful too.

who knows what direction in which we will come to be;
but I hope he finds all the happiness he is due.

part II

depression got the better of him,
i can’t say that it doesn’t hurt,
to be told I want you -but;
is the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.


- To those struggling with depression and dating, there are people out here who are willing to date you despite your disease."
1306,Is it bad that I feel being isolated is good for me.,"I don't know what happened to me over the years but i just slowly became more and more isolated. I think it started around 2014-16 in middle school I was bullied for my race (black) and at that time i never felt so alone. But i never told anyone because I thought it would get worst. In this school snitches were looked downed at. And if I did stand up for myself I would get ganged up on by multiple people. I felt stuck and had no way to get myself out. As the months went by being made fun of was a daily thing for me. The main thing that got me through that tough time was video games. I could play all day and night. Some days I wouldn't do my work because I was to stressed out to work and used video games as my escape (Rainbow 6 siege, Smite, Minecraft, and Halo). Playing my game isolated me but made me feel better. In 2017 we moved to a new house and my parents thought a private school would be better for me (8th Grade). Well that didn't work out either. I didn't get made fun of but I also didn't have any friends there. Just imagine one full year of having know one to talk to. And in order to compensate I stayed in my room played my video games. At the time I was failing some of my classes but I didn't care because I wasn't the best student at the time so I knew they wouldn't hold me back, they definitely did not want to deal with for another year. As that year went by I stayed in my room longer and longer, only coming out when I had to eat or use the bathroom. And even some days I didn't eat of wash up because it would interrupt me playing. I swear that I was super close with my family but over time I became much more closed off from my family. Now i'm in high school. You know more work, harder classes and lots of stress. All the stress built up so I relieved it by playing video games. My games use to take the pain away but now it seems to make it worst. All day I just stay in my room, some days I will just stare in a blank TV for hours on end. This part I really don't know how to explain in words, but i'll try anyway. It seems that my mind attacks me with all my past mistakes and they haunt all day and night if I don't distract myself. And when that distraction is over it feels like i'm getting pelted with hundreds of rocks. And the only place I feel safe is my room. My parents call my room a dungeon cause they don't see me outside it. But when I leave my room i fell out of my element. Like i'm not allowed to be myself. And when I try to be myself I get yelled at. Its like I have to wear a mask when I leave my room or i'll be petrified. BUT here is the best part my parents say i'm hard to talk to or its difficult to get along with me but when I try to limit their exposer I get yelled at. I try to be nice but it doesn't come naturally to me. My mom thinks I enjoy being mean. I don't know maybe it could be the years of being made fun of, hey I apologize i'm not the son you wanted."
1307,I want to be more,"Regardless of how hard I try, nothing works. I'm not satisfied with religion, faith, or most philosophies but I want something more. I want to be something more. The weight of it come crashing down on me everyday. I try to create my own community of like minds but it never works. Fitting in isn't an option for me and no one seems to understand my want of belonging. My last post was similar in nature but this is one of my biggest hurdles in life lately and I'm not sure what to do about it."
1308,Threw away the bottle of wine I bought,"I've been feeling like absolute, maximum level shit. At very serious risk of suicide. I've been getting drunk, cutting myself, and taking sleeping pills every night. And standing at the noose I have hung up in my garage trying to will myself to finally fucking do it because my life isn't worth it.



Got a bottle of wine yesterday that was supposed to be for tonight because the vodka I had ran out and I felt like switching it up. I went for a walk and then came back and threw the wine away instead of drinking it



Still feel like shit, still hurt myself, still took the sleeping pills, still staring at the noose, but didn't drink tonight (that's assuming I don't go buy more which is still possible)"
1309,“Normal” people are bad at helping with depression because they don’t put the effort in to understand it,"I appreciate it when “normal” people try to offer me help, but it is clear that they have no idea what they are talking about. All they do is give me meaningless words of encouragement and act like that’s going to give me a new perspective on life. It doesn’t. I know that they genuinely want to help, but when you pretend you know all the answers to my problems, I am probably not going to take you seriously. Depending on my mood you could actually make me even more mad when you try to cheer me up instead of actually listening to me. Honestly, it just takes a little bit of research to get somewhat of a better understanding of what I am going through. It feels like my friends and family don’t even know the basic list of symptoms for depression. Depression isn’t just being sad all the time, it’s more complicated than that."
1310,Animals,"If you are also suffering from depression, anxiety, etc, like me(depression/loneliness) and feel like nobody loves you remember that no matter how you and what you look like a dog/cat and animals in general will always love you and treat you equally. Looking at them makes me happy and warms my cold dead heart."
1311,"30s, “good life”, and really depressed","It’s the middle of the night and I can’t sleep. I have chest pain as I think about my life. 

I have a “good” job that brings me no satisfaction at all, but I wouldn’t even know what else to do in life.  Starting a new job at my age would be so scary and seemingly pointless. 

I am attractive with a nice home but I could care less. 

I have no real friends or coworkers that I value or respect or value me.  I’ve fallen out with friends and rekindled but it’s not the same. 

My family is small and all does their own thing. 

I am married to a good girl but she doesn’t push me intellectually. 

I go to the gym out of habit. 

I watch tv when I come which becomes boring after a while. 

I have no goals or real hobbies. Getting some would feel pointless. 

I’m very smart and I reflect, analyze CONSTANTLY. I feel like I have 100 mid-life crises a day. 

I know there is no point to life. I don’t envy other people’s lives either. What are we doing? Life is inherently purposeless. 

I don’t have kids and maybe they’d give me purpose as crazy as that sounds but then they’d have to suffer life like I’m suffering now. 

Nothing anyone can say would make a difference. People who tell you it gets better don’t think like me. I know I’m going to live a bland, nothing life   Fuckkkkk!"
1312,I'm a bit suicidal. I'll probably get over it.,"I'm going to sleep on it.

I've sent texts to 7 individuals.

If tomorrow I wake up and I'm not okay, and no one has reached out, I'll feel like shit.

I've lost some friends. I just need one person to care.

I just want some positivity to get through the night."
1313,BAKERSLATT IS A DEPRESSED PUSSY FAG NIGGER SHITSKIN,HOPE HE DIES SOON HIS FAMILY WAS SLAVES
1314,Losing my sense of purpose,"A few years ago I thought I had my future planned out. I was going to school for a specific profession and put in long hours of studying to get grades that would get me into grad school. During my last term in college (before my bachelors) I felt the desire to continue the pursuit of my goals slowly fade. By the time I graduated I knew that I didn’t want to pursue grad school in that area anymore.
I thought that even if I didn’t want to go in that direction, other doors would open up for me and I would be inspired to go down another path... that didn’t happen. 
Now here I am 6 months later, still unemployed and no closer to figuring out what I want to do. In those 6 months I’ve managed to fall into my worst depressive state yet. I now think more about how badly I’d rather just die than anything about my future. People around me (especially my parents) constantly ask me about my future plans and ambitions. Unfortunately, at this point I don’t have any. Literally none. 
I don’t even know where to start anymore. My passions have mostly all slowly faded away as the depression barged in and it seems like there is nothing here for me. It really sucks to lose your passions and future plans. Without anything to work towards, I feel like my life has absolutely no purpose anymore. I’m just an empty shell of my former self that wakes up to get nothing done... waiting to go back to sleep where I don’t have to feel like a failure. I hope it gets better, but at this rate I don’t see myself finding anything that will bring me any fulfillment."
1315,Denial,Is anyone else in denial that they probably have problems
1316,People judge me because they don't understand me.,"I've always been weird. I cry a lot and have frequent emotional breakdowns. People know that I'm weird. They avoided me and avoided me even more when I told them what's going on (I have Asperger's syndrome and depression). I also have oversensitive hearing, and I often hear people talking about me at school.

""He's weird.""
""Don't worry, he just wants attention.""

That last one hurt me severely. People don't even think I can be sad. Oh, and this:

""He doesn't have feelings.""

Yes, someone said that while I was crying.

Besides that, once, some of the younger kids were giving out candy. I wanted some, but they gave me nothing. Meanwhile, everyone else was enjoying their candy. It wasn't just for a small group. It was for everyone except me.

There are many more examples, but I won't give you all of them."
1317,They don't believe you till you're dead,"Lately, after years of nothing but pain and suffer, fighting every fucking day doing nothing but trying my absolute entire fucking best, my entire family, school and everyone else involved came to conclusion that I must be a liar, digging for attention, trying to get out of things easily with “threats"". 

To my mom and everyone else who deeply ""cares about me"": we will see about that when you'll see my lying in my coffin. I truly wish I would be there to see the expression in your faces."
1318,2nd day of Zoloft. Terrible. Anyone have experience with Zoloft,"I’ll give some backstory about me. I’ve always been one to show less emotions and wouldn’t speak on things bothering me. I still have a social life and would party with my friends but I always felt insecure at times or have anxiety. At times I’d feel depressed and sometimes think about what it was like if I was gone out of nowhere, but overall happy, weird to say.

When I Made a Change: I started noticing my anxiety in some social situations, and one day in a lecture started having what I thought was a heart attack, I was having a panic attack. I’ve always been a worrier but that was my first since then I’ve had a couple more and rushes of anxiety. Started feeling like I needed to get it taken care of or I would “go off the rails”

Anxiety and Treatment:
I function well and complete tasks and goals and have friends, but I’m can be constantly worried, I’ve before at 2AM, in bed, randomly started worrying about how I’m going to handle my taxes this year which led to a lot of other things that I couldn’t stop thinking about mostly uncomfortable thoughts and once I pushed one out another thought would start. After taking to a therapist and being prescribed kolonopin it helped and I went through a period of more mild anxiety. Recently I noticed I was beginning to have those same random thoughts again, and talking to my therapist about it, and was prescribed Xanax.

Where Zoloft comes in: 
I have been worried about benzodiazepine addition when I was first prescribed klonopin, so when I was prescribed Xanax I knew that it is more dangerous than K, so I have only been allowing myself it once or twice a week even though I’m prescribed 1mg upto three times a day, (1mg doesn’t do much to me not sure why because I never took the K daily or much more than 3 times a week). I started taking Xanax more as my anxiety’s gotten bad and have been taking them more than I’d like to allow my self and started to almost self medicate when I’ve been having this anxiety more which now includes depression (I’ve been considering myself a high functioning slightly depressive)
So worrying about building up a dependency to benzodiazepines I said that I think I would like to try a low level or lose dose antidepressant even though I hate the idea of it, didn’t really want the stigma of anti depressants and side effects, but did because it would be something more long term and overall mood changing and It could possibly benefit me.

(I do know Zoloft is supposed to take weeks was told 4 weeks for your fam to see, 8 for you)

Day 1: Took it about noon, a bit later I started feeling kind of hazy and almost high, dis coordinated at times. I also paced a bit during the day, hung out with a friend felt pretty fine and and later felt a bit nauseous, barely noticeable though, at night I was very anxious and took a klonopin. 

Day 2: Took Zoloft at the same time. Called off work 
Was hazy again and pacing more and was not comfortable. Played video games and talked to family for most of the day, talked to them a bit more about what’s going on. Took a kolonopin. Was getting depressed, had to go get gas for my car and on the drive there was listening to music and thought that if I was to get in a car accident and die this would be the time (sounds sad typing this and actually letting people hear) when I left the gas station I passed  my sub and just felt like going on a drive which was relaxing. I felt depressed still at home and was having anxious ruminating thoughts on the past and took another kolonopin and went to bed.

Day 3: Woke up felt fine took the Zoloft around the same time as the day before felt a bit hazy again but fine was pretty content with everything, later went to work and felt like a zombie felt like my brain was cloudly and that I had little emotion, looked at things from the past and got sad but smoked a bit and went to bed.

I seriously think I’m having side effects because before I’ve always been happy, driven, but a worryier and possibly a high functioning depressive but I’ve never been like this. Am I experiencing side effects? Should I contact my doctor?"
1319,I feel like shit and my depression came back again.,"Just got told multiple times by a girl that she doesn’t like me like that and even if she were single she wouldn’t get with me. Another one with me right there that another girls boyfriend looks better then me. It would have been fine if it was behind my back but for that to be said I’m front of me was quite demeaning and brought me back to my elementary and middle school days when I was bullied and told I was worthless, weird and ugly. The one girl even made up lies about how I treated her at work just to make me look like an asshole or a terrible person.  I’m like the nicest person there. I say hi to almost everyone and ask everyone how their day is going. I’m not looking for attention just needed somewhere to vent with people like me."
1320,I wish I was like everyone else.,"Hi. I've always felt weird and left out since I was in kindergarten. I know that most people wouldn't remember their kindergarten days, but mine were extremely traumatic. Kids ran away from me and I didn't know why. Maybe it's because of my behavior. I frequently have emotional breakdowns and cry a lot. I also have different hobbies. Most of the people I know now enjoy sports and video games. I enjoy computer programming and, well, making stuff in general. In 4th grade, everyone bullied me for being such a 'nerd'. Now, people tell me that I'm dumb and that I shouldn't even be allowed to go to a normal school. I know deep inside that I should be who I am, but I just wish I was like everyone else."
1321,Obsessed with what happens after death ..,"The last few months I’ve been obsessed with the thought of death and the fact nobody knows what happens . I find it hard to enjoy life when I’m constantly questioning if there’s a reason for this . Like why am I getting up for work or trying to connect with strangers when I may never see them again after this life anyways . I used to be very religious but as I got older I question it more and more . Wouldn’t it suck to just to never see anyone you love ever again ? At the end of the day when we die we go out just as we came into this world . Alone . I don’t fear death itself , I fear the unknown"
1322,I broke up with my girlfriend.,"I did it, I broke up with her, my girlfriend of 5 months, i can't ever keep a relationship it seems, and i always ruin my significant others life, I'm just so sad thst i can't really be in a relationship, it's just so hard for me it seems... Im so depressed, my life is just in shambles, I broke up with her feeling like i had no say in it, i really loved her... I did.. I grew attached but now... I don't know .. were long distance and i just dont thinj it will work, not to mention she requires attention 24/7 every minute of the day, and i just can't give that to her, I loved her.. but she made herself my life, she wouldnt even let me tslk to my best friend of 2 years because she was female (even though the frirnd in question is like a sister to me) she controlled me a lot and i was growing tired of it... 24/7 I'd be on my phone attending to her , I neglected loved ones even.."
1323,I don’t understand. Why me?,"It all started in year 7, when id think about sad things too often and not really know why. I’d tell myself ‘oh its nothing, your not depressed.’ From then on the next 6 months it manifested into ‘i want to be depressed, but i don’t’ i couldn’t understand why, i don’t still to this day. The next two years it turned into some fairly bad anxiety and depression, I’m now 15, in year 9, going onto year 10. I spent all of this year wandering the halls trying to find someone to talk to, nobody was there. I felt so isolated in this pitch black claustrophobic box they call depression. Come by November and this month, i met a girl, and she was so perfect. She was my first kiss and the closest i had ever been to anyone ever. She was the light of my life, for once i was finally feeling better about myself. Unfortunately, for reasons I’m not going to say because shes everything to me, she decided it was better to be friends (for the time being). She told me that yesterday. It destroyed me, i planned to ask her out the weekend coming. It may only be for the time being but shes now leaving me on delivered for 2 hours at a time, which to me feels like a lifetime. I told her that I’m going to wait for her until shes ready for a relationship, however long that may be. But i have a feeling that the longer i wait, the worse ill become, because I’m now back to having nobody. When she told me that we could be in a relationship when shes ready I reminisced of a particular scene from bojack horseman. I quote “if you find someone that you can halfway tolerate you sink your nails in and you don’t let go, or else you’ll just get older, and emptier”. 

I don’t know what to do. I broke down twice today standing up out of bed, i haven’t eaten anything. I cried so hard i gave myself a blood nose. I know this sounds like some dumb kid overreacting about a relationship, and yeah, it is, but to me, shes all i had. It feels like it would be so much easier if i just kill myself, then i wouldn’t have to be so dramatic about this. Im sorry for wasting your time. 

Thanks for reading if you did :("
1324,No progress.,"I’ve notice that my depression is getting worse, getting out of bed and taking care of myself is the least I could do , but it’s a struggle to even do so. 
I go to therapy and have seen the same doctor for more than a year now , I feeling terrible for him , it must suck to have a patient to come in every week and complain about the same old things and get better sometimes but then always in the same rut. 
Feeling like I’m just a burden to most people in my life these days. 
If what i wrote does not make sense it’s because I’m tired."
1325,am i making a fuss or am i just really depressed?,"I'm 15yo boy and my holidays are in two days, so I should be really happy like every normal student. I had plans to do many things these holidays: Work to get some money to buy maybe something I want, go out with friends, play video games (obviously), lose weight and study, as my results recently have been sub-par, which I had decided to change over the New Years.

But nothing is fucking going to plan.

I'm a Blackbelt in Taekwondo and during sparring a few weeks back, I blocked a kick with my hand in an extremely awkward position. It severely hurt my wrist but after 2 weeks it got better, with some mild annoyances still present; but mostly better. Jump to the present 7 weeks later, turns out an X-ray revealed that I had fractured the third metacarpal, meaning that I would be stuck in a splint on my dominant hand (right) for 6 weeks, the entire length of my holidays. 

Its now significantly harder to do anything, including writing this goddamn long rant about my fucking life. Gaming is a big part of my life which I often indulge in during the holidays: I can fucking say goodbye to that shit. 

I'm also naturally lazy, despite being a consistent 80%+ performer while studying for tests on the day, but my 57% math score really did a number on me, let alone my Asian parents. Before my splint, I started studying an easy 3 hours a day, as it gave me a sense of relief from my bad score as I felt like through hard work would make up for my past mistakes; a sense of redemption. My fucking injury has made it impossible to do maths equations (injured writing hand), meaning I will have to work doubly hard with online resources like Khan Academy instead.

I've read many articles on injury caused depression recently, and the general consensus that I've come up with is the first step is too accept the limitations.

\- There will be no video games

\- studying will be harder

\- Life will be harder

I do still have a speck of hope that when the physio gives me a more high-tech splint that allows my ring finger to move a pen and play league or my recovery will be faster than the allotted 6 weeks, but the truth has started to dawn on me that there is no easy way out from this injury.

Friends are something I still have, as hanging out with them would still be a distinct possibility if my mum didn't go apeshit. My grandparents are coming over and I had planned a sleepover which was harshfully rejected as I should 'spend time with my grandparents.' They are here for a good 3 weeks and I'm sure they will also go out with friends during their time here, meaning that my request to spend time with my friends does not seem unreasonable. One thing she uses against me is my report, which I only got 6 A's and 3B's , and it doesn't help that 2 of the B's are maths and science.

In a way she is not wrong, but I've been feeling like shit recently, and she nor my injury is helping. I felt like dog shit before I was this restricted and now I'm feeling even worse. In the past I would not play long hours to feel good, but to relieve the emptiness, pain of life and real world worries. I don't blame my mum for getting triggered at me, as she doesn't fucking understand anyway. Even I think my life is pretty stress free from her perspective.

I've spent my last weekend doing nothing; being lazy and watching YouTube while craving for a game of League of Legends with some friends. I have become the person I vowed to destroy; stupid, lazy and fat.

If anyone has any tips it would be appreciated; Thank you."
1326,it really feels like nobody cares,"no one I've been friends with or associated with in the past cares. I'm alone in all of this crap that keeps building up, and I just want out."
1327,How do I start enjoying things again?,"It's like everything has gone out the window, I've lost all motivation to do anything, and all interests I used to have, I never find enjoyment in anything I do anymore. It'd be cool to pick things back up but I feel so crushed."
1328,Bye Guys,"Hey guys my name is  Landen Haynes from Owen Sound, Ontario and Im ending my life tonight and I just wanted to let all the nice people of reddit to know and I hope they have a great life there's no turning back from this I got the pills ready"
1329,I don’t want to go to school this semester,"My professor has made it clear she hates me. I can’t take any of my classes anywhere else and I can’t take them from a different professor.
I don’t have any friends at school or outside of school. I’m not even enjoying learning anymore.
The pressure I feel during the semester is enough to make me suicidal.
I’ve tried going to a doctor, but I get shot down at any suggestion for my treatment. Antidepressants don’t work for me anymore."
1330,Does anyone ever fell like your time is slowly ticking away?,"It’s been a bit of an emotional roller coaster these past 4 years. I genuinely feel like I’ve forgotten how happiness feels, for an extended amount of time. My depression has significantly decreased since summer, for which I am truly thankful for. Yet every day I fall into this dark place and then i find myself feeling like I am a horrible person. I just fell so useless and unimportant to my peers, or even the world for that matter. I feel terrified of death and nearly drive myself crazy with thoughts on the daily. I seriously want to just feel whole again and be a more wholesome and positive person. I am only 16 years old but I feel so drained and can’t even imagine how life is going to be for me as an adult."
1331,Low functioning depression,"i wish i could ignore what i’m going through and just go to college or get a job. but i feel like a useless piece of shit lol and getting help seems pointless. Psychiatrists and therapists keep wasting my time by not diagnosing me or simply NOT listening, giving me medication that doesn’t help my symptoms. My mind feels hazy, cracked, fucking disgusting like ‘muk’. If another person tells me i just have to “get out of it” or “help myself” or “put effort” in i’m gonna lose it. Because i’m putting in effort and it leads me nowhere and i don’t see any doctors putting in the effort to help me. I just wanna feel better. please."
1332,Really? What's the point?,"I got a decent job, saved up. Bought a truck to get to work. Have to work to pay for the truck. Saved up more. Bought a house. Have to work cause now I have all this this shit to pay for. 

""Hey, you're life must be going great. You're an adult now.""

Yeah cool I can't wait to be in this cycle just to die whenever."
1333,Its been over ten years,"Welp, I never thought this would happen again, but I cut myself tonight. I'm actually incredibly embarrassed to admit it. That's all"
1334,I don’t want to be alive anymore,"But I can’t kill myself

Why?"
1335,I have never met anyone that could understand what I'm going through,"I've been to two psychologists and had 100 drunken phone calls to talk about depression, but no one ever gets it. I know I'm inevitably going to kill myself so it doesn't matter anyway, but I just wish I could meet one person in real life who actually understood me. The problem with people like me is that we isolate ourselves so much that we're almost impossible to find. I'm never going to find someone I can relate to."
1336,Im coming to the end of the road.," I have always had a good life. My parents love me, my family cares about me, i have had a few close friends. I go to college, I have a job, yet I still feel a ridiculous amount of pain. I constantly feel alone, even when in a room of people, and it just hurts so badly. My parents shower me with love, but I still feel like nobody really likes me, and feel like its not real. I had a bestfriend who tried to help me with my problems but no matter how much I wanted it to be enough it never was and I still continued to hurt. I feel like such a terrible person constantly for this. Theres so many people with worst lives, but I still feel terribly hurt, and down constantly. I wish i could feel better and make those around me who cant help me feel like they did something. Why do I feel like such a big peice of me is not there, I feel useless, and worth significantly less than everyone else. I go to the therapist, and he tells me things and its just like words coming out of his mouth but none of them mean anything to me. Especially since its someone getting paid to tell me nice things. It doesnt help at all. I started taking antidepressents and they dont seem to be working. I still feel so much pain, and it feels like the only way out is to die, but i dont want to die... Ill have some short bursts of hapiness, maybe for an hour or so a day and itll just go right back into shit. I cant handle the pain... Whats next for me, what do i do..."
1337,Is wanting gifts on Christmas greedy?,"I’ll try to make this short, but it’s really not. 

My husband and I have been together for almost 5 years and almost married for 2. The first 3 Christmas’ we’re cool. He would get me gift cards and got me 1-2 gifts under the tree. We got married last June, and I gave birth to our son 10 days before Christmas. My childhood was always fucked up and Christmas was the only day when it seemed right so I am kinda obsessed with Christmas. Last year for Christmas, we didn’t get each other anything. I didn’t have the time or energy as I was high risk and at the doctors constantly. This year, our baby is finally a lot easier, and I have told my husband I wanted gifts. He gave me a present the other day which was an ornament that I absolutely love, but tonight he told me he was just going to put a few things in my stocking, and nothing under the tree. I honestly feel horrible for being so sad about this because growing up we had nothing so I understand what it feels like to get nothing, but I have done all of the shopping for nieces and nephews, our son, and got him presents as well. I don’t want to be greedy, but I feel like it will be sad if he and my son are opening presents and I have nothing to open. His family never celebrated Christmas growing up because they’re from Hong Kong, but he knows how important Christmas is to me. I have told him about my wish list I made, I have told him things I want or need, and he’s just not internalizing what I am saying. My best friend is highly mad at him because he doesn’t really understand the things I do for the family, and never listens to me and constantly ignores the things I say or ask, but I just think we are having trouble communicating our love languages. Am I being greedy or do I have a right to be depressed about it? 

Thanks in advance"
1338,New school,I’ve(16F)(junior) recently moved schools 30 minutes away because my parents wanted to build a house on a plot of land. And with this new school I just can’t fit in. I’m having mental break downs because of it. My self esteem has gone to -1000 and I honestly don’t think I can go any longer..I want to go back..I miss my community..I miss my school..I miss my friends..my parents don’t understand and tell me “you’re almost done.” “You won’t talk to anyone once you graduate” still it sucks to be alone! 30 mins away..I can maybe drive to my old school once I get my license but I want out now. :(
1339,How your insomnia start? Does it get bad right at the beginning?,"Recently, I have trouble sleeping a night straight and difficult to fall asleep even when I'm tired. Does it a symptom of insomnia?"
1340,Going on two months of headache,"I've had a headache every day for two months. It's usually not bad and I can ignore it when I'm busy but it's always there.

I started Prozac a month ago - no change in the headache. I assumed it was caused by the depression as it started when I spiraled down. I have crappy mental health coverage and can't see a therapist more than once every several weeks - probably why she pushed me to try medication.

Is depression headache a thing? I told the psychiatrist I had a headache every day and she didn't address it specifically. Should I go to my regular doctor? I can't take being miserable and in physical pain too. I'm so tired of this."
1341,I dont know what to do...,"I am a sophomore in college. I live with 4 others in a house 2 miles of my schools main campus. Over the last several months I have felt the guys I live with getting more and more distant from me. The guy who I thought was my bestfriend refuses to spend time with me and wont look me in the eye. I dont know what I did wrong and have been stuck in a cycle of blaming myself. It has gotten to the point where I spend 20-22 hours a day in my room, only leaving for food and the occasional class I decide to go to. I drink and smoke weed every night so I dont have to think about my life as I try and sleep. What do I do..."
1342,Treatment didn't stick,"I'm a 17 year old male in the Western US, and I've been depressed, anxious, and unhappy for the last several years. I hid it for a long time, but about a year and a half ago my facade cracked. I crumbled, my grades dropped off, and my parents finally figured out something was wrong. They sent me to therapy, which lasted for months, and anti depressants, which I'm still on today. While I was... better, at the end of it, and not as intensely sad, I find that these days I've just been dead inside. Emotions are shallow and fleeting, and in addition to the ennui and inertia, I'm still haunted by a nebulous sense of loss (of what?) that therapy couldn't banish. I'm somewhat more functional, but even that feels like it's balanced on a knife's edge. I'm not sure what to do. I hate the idea of talking to my parents, becoming a burden again, especially when I leave for college next summer. I don't want them to think the entire first ordeal was for nothing. Anyways, if therapy only partially worked the first time (with a therapist I liked and respected) how can I expect it to work this time? I'm not sure anybody can make me less simultaneously apathetic and fragile, less simultaneously distant and hungry for connection. What the hell am I supposed to do?"
1343,Each day feels like a battle,"I'm a struggling university student studying Computer Science. I began my studies very strong and confident but over the years, my mental and physical health have begun to fall apart; we have one last exam and then christmas break an I'm battling to revise. It's so hard on my head even though it's not too hard. Life is hard."
1344,Not everyone’s cut out for a jam-packed adventure of a life.,"I almost feel like an outcast sometimes, seeing friends have their entire future planned for years to come. Steady job, high professional ambitions, touring, holidays, hobbies, relationships/Marriage, kids/grandkids etc. It just feels so strange knowing people want to achieve so much. Obviously there’s nothing wrong with this sort of life if you can manage it, but i just want to live simply.I often feel like society has advanced too fast for our brains to catch up, with so many new inventions and events have occurred in less than a century and progression is the highest it’s ever been. And now there’s an impossible standard of living in western culture where you are having to constantly achieving or doing something different.  

Sometimes we need to take a step back and realise the effects of this. Not everyone can be the adventurer, some people just aren’t cut out for that life. There’s nothing shameful or bad about just simply surviving. After all, that’s what humans were meant to do, survive. People forget that’s how we’re even here today. 

So if you ever find yourself comparing to others, don’t worry. Especially to any Americans out there, I feel like there can be an unfair pressure on you guys to succeed. Obviously stride for your goals in life, but don’t do it just because you’ve been instructed by other people, do it for yourself."
1345,"Sometimes, pain comes to a point where you don’t know what to do anymore.","You know, that point where you wonder why you try. When all the roadblocks that you can find your way around or even defeat always seem to find their way back. When, late at night, mind clouded with hopeless dreams of what life could be, that dark loneliness seeps in. 

The constant reminder ringing in your head, whether it be from others or yourself. “Why would I ever be good enough?” And so it goes again. That gut wrenching heart ache. Constant exhaustion, being nauseated at times even. Feeling so sick over the people who couldn’t care less. Feeling so sick over the problems I just can’t solve. Feeling frustrated and angry about the unfairness in life. I’m exhausted, and it’s getting harder to even find a good direction to go in, to talk about. There’s just so much. 

From family to chronic depression to heartbreak. So many issues, so much.. bullshit. I feel so sick, I’m so tired. Dear god, just let someone help me. Even in caring so very much about the people in my life, it never matters. I will ALWAYS be a second thought, a second choice. It’s been this way forever and I don’t think it will change. I hope nobody I know reads this, honestly. I hope nobody knows its me. At the same time though, all I want is for someone to just listen and hear my desperate cry for help, and be there. Be a friend, for my family to actually support me. 

I’m in such a dark place, it’s so hard to even make myself leave my house. I feel nauseous even thinking about sleeping because I know I’ll only have to leave in the morning. I’ll have to put on a smile, hell even a blank face and get through the day. And even then, I still cry. A hopeless feeling, all of this is.. i don’t even know why I’m writing all of this, part of me just feels like a burden consistently and that includes on any place I decide to speak my mind. I feel so empty and this is honestly just another cry for help, a cry for someone to notice me. Because the people in my life who claim they care... don’t. That’s how it’s been, and I don’t think it’ll change.

That’s all. Thank you, for anyone who actually read this. I’m just really hurting right now. I have been, and there’s so much to deal with that I just don’t have the energy for."
1346,I literally can not wake up in the morning.,"At first, I thought it was as a result of my medicine. So I changed that.  
Then I thought it was a result of bad eating habits. I started drinking more water and trying to eat healthier on a budget.  
Then I thought it was because I wasn't working out enough. So I tried doing more pushups and running.

Then I just accepted I'll never be able to wake up on time, and it must have something to do with my depression.

I guess I just don't want to stop dreaming. I don't want to wake up and face the day. I don't want to have to go through the same shitty cycle that I have to go through every day.

I might not be able to graduate high school because I've been late for class about 3/4 of the days of the year so far, since August. I can't tell them it's because of depression, because even my family doesn't believe it and doesn't care, so I just say I slept in, every single day.

It sucks. Everyone thinks I'm irresponsible. Or that I don't want to go to school. Or that I don't want to wake up.

I'm such a morning person. There's not much that beats long morning drives as the sun rises. It makes me so happy to get up early and start the day right and be energized for my first period, and getting work done so I don't stress about it later, and just being up at 5:00 AM. 

I haven't woken up earlier than 6:45 AM since August or September, when school started again. I've missed several days of work because I just don't wake up, and my boss doesn't like it at all and I have to lie about my reasoning. I've failed classes because of this. I've talked to my therapist and he recommended to change things like my eating and exercise habits, but it's not helping at all. I'm still not waking up in the morning.

I literally don't hear my alarm go off most days. The days I do, I guess I unconsciously turn it off. Yes, I get up and turn it off and go back to bed without thinking about it at all. I wake up and the first thing I think, lying in bed feeling sick, with a headache and fighting the urge to not start crying (which is my daily wakeup) is about how much I just want to die. How much I want to never have to show up late again. How much I want to just get out of this fucking world early so I never have to get cancelled on by my fake fucking friends again.

I just want to be happy again. I want to look forward to the day ahead. The only days that I was able to wake up on time this school year were the days that I was doing something fun and not going to school. My parents use this as a reason to push their case, even though I genuinely enjoy school when I wake up on time and don't trudge in an hour late.

I don't know why I woke up those days. I guess I was just really happy to be doing something and travelling and helping others (one of them was like a mental health awareness day, and I was volunteering.) 

I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. People always give me that bullshit about ""it gets better!"" but does it really? It doesn't feel like it. No matter what I've tried, I'm still stuck in this shitty place.

With love."
1347,Why am i the most hated being,"My alignments are INFJ

Sun: Libra/ Moon Taurus/ Venus Virgo/ Mercury Scorpio/ Mars Scorpio 

20s Female ( i literally forgot my age cause I don’t see the point)

I feel and believe that I’m a total ice queen. Instead of walls I have fortresses. Instead talking things out and remove things preemptively.

Everything my signs, my personality, morals, and codes tell me I should fit in no problem. Yet i feel so far isolated from everyone. I’m haunted with my dream qoute “ just because people like you doesn’t mean they enjoy your company” So far it’s true.

All of those who I believe were my friends forgot about me or im usually looking from the outside in. I thought about getting my closest “friend” a gift, but i wonder he probably wouldn’t care.

So far all the time i fight with my friends it’s usually because they call me a liar or overreacting. Been told im just gold digger and a drama queen. I didn’t really consider them friends only associates.

I found out my astrological alignments and found out they describe me almost 90%, they point out my weaknesses of being insecure/ overly trusting. However, i cover those by standing on my on and removing people who cross me immediately.

Do i have to be weak in order to be liked? or is this the price i pray for safety? Why am I so hated?"
1348,How do I get people off my back?,"I wish I lived alone. I live with a house mate &amp; I'm tired of feeling guilty for not leaving my room, cleaning my dishes, not buying toilet paper etc.  I know they think that something is wrong but I just want to be left alone.   
I know it sounds selfish but right now im sick of being answerable to people.  If I had the flu or a physical illness it wouldn't be an issue but obviously depression isn't understood. It took me hours to muster up the energy to wash the dishes today &amp; it took one plate to splash some water on me to smash it out of rage. 

I wish certain people could just endure 1 hour of what I'm going through so they get it and get off my back. Fighting off constant suicidal thoughts is fkn exhausting on top of the medication I take at night that makes me sleep for 13 hours.  
I just want to lay in bed, peel myself out of it when I have to work &amp; not have to answer my phone to pesty messages. Every time I get a text from my parents or a friend I want to throw my phone at the wall. If I don't answer they will message my house mate asking if I'm ok - just piss off! I was even straight up honest to friends the other night about why I couldn't come to dinner and they still made me feel guilty about not coming??

Again, I know this sounds self centered because most of the people do care but I don't want to talk to anyone and I don't want the extra guilt on top of what I'm already feeling. How can I make people back off and leave me alone??"
1349,Disability for depression?,"I recently had to take a medical leave from college because my psychiatrist recommended that I do so. I also had to quit my job because I couldn’t deal with my problems and work at the same time.  I’ve been committed to the hospital involuntarily two times in the past two months, and I am at the point where I still haven’t gotten any better. 
Currently I am living at my dad’s house, and he is letting me stay in his guest room. However, my dad usually rents out this guest room to help pay his mortgage, and he recently told me that I am going to have to start paying rent so he can afford his house. I understand where my dad is coming from. It’s fair. Right now he is letting me stay for free til February, but after that, I’m on my own. 

Has anyone received disability because of their depression? I was recommended not to work, I can’t go to school, and I can’t afford to take care of myself. My therapist told me that disability was an option, but I’m wondering if disability for depression is an actual thing. 

If you have any experience with this stuff, please tell me about it. I would love to hear what you have to say. 
Thanks !"
1350,I keep waking up as the same person,"Today I drove to another high school across town. It’s where all my elementary school friends went. For some reason, I went to a different high school. 

I graduated from high school 1 and a half years ago. It was a horrible experience. I was embarrassed many times and depressed everyday and lonely. I’ve lost all my friends. I’m not in touch with anyone anymore.

If only I had gone to this other high school, things would be different. I keep fantasizing about it. Fantasizing about who I’d be, about all the fun I would have had with my elementary school friends, about the girls I would have met, about all the different people and things I would have seen and memories I would have made.

My high school experience was utter garbage, and so is my college experience so far. I can feel the urge to fail my classes and kill myself everyday. I have no purpose. I don’t care about anything. This is a fucking nightmare. I can’t go back. I fantasize about it. I keep waking up the same person. I fucking hate it. Fuck this. It’s disgusting. I hate my life. Fuck this shit. I fucking hate it all."
1351,Looking back,"Excuses excuses are all that I use, there in my mind where I just want to die. I don't really know myself or how I used to behave but when I look back at it all and see what I once was I begin to cave."
1352,My family destroyed our lives and left us homeless at 19. I can't take it amymore,"This is mostly a copy/paste from a r/legaladvice thread I posted so sorry if it reads weird.

My mother is a recovering alcoholic and also has severe anxiety towards the health of her parents. We were living with our grandparents trying to get back on out feet (they welcomed us with open arms) and everything was great, we were able to help my grandparents with activities of daily living in exchange for a place to stay... Until my uncle calls and screams at my grandmother until she cries and says he and my mother's sister are going to visit us and stay in the home.

Anyways, my mother's siblings have a history of doing horrible things so she was understandably stressed, being forced to deal with her nightmare siblings right after her dad had a stroke. She stayed home (didn't live once) for over a month just to take care of them.

One night, my uncle attempted to physically block her from helping my grandfather to use the bathroom and she had had a few drinks. Grandpa has always needed help in the past and always will. After she tried to push past him he tackled her to the ground and her head hit the floor, hard. My mom was not being violent at all. They proceeded to call the police and said my mother was causing a disturbance. When the police got there they asked me what happened, I told them he threw her onto the hard wood floor. I didn't see much else.

This ended in my mom being taken to the hospital and my uncle tried to kick me out of the house (which he doesn't own) the next day I went to visit my mom because I didn't trust them. When I returned they locked me out and called the police, forcing us to leave. They then proceeded to try to repossess presents my grandparents gave me over the years unsuccessfully, but they got my car because it was still in my grandmother's name to my knowledge. They accused me of being a drug dealer after finding my grandmother (and my) stash of cannabis, and a jar of a powdered supplement they assumed was cocaine (it wasn't)

My mom is not allowed to see her parents until both her siblings ""judge her as being clean and sober for an extended period of time"". She asked to see her parents before New year's and they acted like they didn't know who she was.

I called my uncle and told him he needed to let my mother see her parents before they pass on. He told me that they have a restraining order against my mom and she cannot go near them. The police have done much more harm than help unfortunately. He threatened to call the police if I contact him again. We have contacted all local law enforcement agencies we could think of and still cannot find out if there is a restraining order, although I suspect they're bluffing.

I have nothing now. I have my mom. I have an apartment a crackhead wouldn't want to live in. I can't go a single day without using pretty much every drug in existence. Life is a living hell. I was going to go to college. I was going to be something.

Now I'll be dead. I can't afford medicine, I can't even afford to miss a day of work due to terrible management and lack of healthcare. I'm 20 and not only do I not have a car but I keep failing my driver's test so that ruins any chance of forming any kind of relationship with anybody, romantic or not. My family framed me. My uncle beat my mom half to death. All of my friends either abandoned me or want to hang out so they can steal something from me.

The day I die will be the happiest day of my life."
1353,I got depression at 10 years old.,"I got clinical depression at 10, bullying was major at my school. Anyways, the school was shit at tolerating the bullies, and I got in trouble for absolutely no reason in class. Teacher was a bitch, and she didn't help. I literally missed weeks of school because I was at the hospital with my psychologist. I cut, and I attempted suicide so much. That was 2017. I don't cut anymore, but I still try for suicide. Oh well, I can't go back anyways. My parents think I'm fine and happy so I'm not going back anytime soon. Even though I come home from school crying. And I usually cry myself to sleep. There's no point in saying ""Go get some help"" because I can't. I went to a depression site for my country, and waited 1 hour for an online counsellor until I realised there was no point in trying as I wouldn't get one."
1354,Physically sick and mentally depressed 😭,
1355,Ashamed of my love of video games,"I(20m) lived through my whole childhood ashamed of my love of video games. It felt so dirty to love something everyone around me told me was a waste of my life. The truth is that video games are just more fun and accessible than a lot of the activities in real life. Now I have a girlfriend, and she plays video games a lot just like me, but I can’t shake this shame I feel for loving video games. She seems to not care at all that I love video games and enjoys playing them with me. But I still try and hide it. I switch tabs back to homework when she walks in the room and stuff like that. My therapist has convinced me that there is nothing to be ashamed of but my shame is still there. It makes life difficult constantly being ashamed of the things you do. It probably contributed to my depression that I’ve had since childhood. What do I do?"
1356,I see no way out.,I honestly dont. I always end up here again. I always lose another job. I thought about trying to make YouTube vids for a living but who'd want to hear me talk? I have nothing to offer the world I'm losing my health insurance and I can't maintain my sanity with out my meds. I see my marriage failing. I can not get pregnant although I want to desperately. I'm tired. I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of living. I can't kill myself. But I know I'll have the further pain of watching everything good in my life crumble before me and this disease chaining me to the wall with the knowledge that i did this. I can't but I don't know what to do at this point. I have been depressed for so long. I'm losing all hope. I have nothing left and I'm desperate.
1357,It just isn't worth it anymore,"Every day is the same thing over and over again. 

Wake up.

Go to class. 

Try again.

Work hard. 

Go to work. 

Fail. 

Try again"
1358,I'm back.,I knew I'd be back. Here I am.
1359,I used to think mania meant happiness.,"I even convinced myself I wasn't a manic depressive because I didn't have what I thought were the symptoms of mania. Happiness, excitedness, increased sex drive. I don't get any of that, I'm unhappy, dull and rarely horny even in my most manic of manic states. I get verbose, my mind races and tears itself apart, I want to rip my own skin off just so the pain can distract me from the maelstrom in my mind. I only get increased energy if I want to escape from a situation, I get frantic and worked up about it, sometimes actually physically running away from situations. 

All the things I used to associate with mania are things I don't have, but yeah, I'm a bipolar mess just like my mother was."
1360,Is it valid if I didn't go to a psychologist?,"It started when I was 12. I used to be a great student. Top of the class. You could always see me smiling and helping others.

Somewhere along the line, it just changed. My grades dropped drastically and in eighth grade I managed keep myself above the failing spectrum. But in ninth grade I was failed once or twice too.

This elicited my mum asking me, “Are you okay? What's wrong with you? You've changed.”

I chickened out of telling her, and just went on with my life feeling like I didn't want to and didn't deserve to live. Everytime I did something wrong, and my parents yelled at me, I would self harm as a way of 'punishing' myself. 

I cried myself to sleep every night, holding in my screams because I didn't want to bother anyone. I used to love school but now I didn't even want to get out of bed. Every morning my house would be filled with yelling, because 'I was being a donkey'. 

I eventually did start going to school everyday, and I made a few friends. 

I decided that I would be more positive. That I would actually try, and it worked for some time. I actually thought I was happy. I *was* happy, but it just keeps coming back. 

The worst part is that my father thinks of depression as something that's not real. He thinks it's just a phase, and that people use it to get attention. This stops me from ever wanting to tell my family. 

I researched for hours, about what depression is, it's symptoms, different types of depression. And I have the symptoms, I can relate, but I don't feel like it's valid.

It's as though my depression is not as important as the ones that are clinically diagnosed. I feel like it's not important at all. I mean, I could be doing it for attention, too. I don't feel like I am, but my mind thinks I'm just doing it for attention."
1361,Ideas for productive fun things/hobbies to do?,"Im trying to change my life but I don't have an activity that I do day to day that makes me happy so Im trying to look for one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I normally just play games or watch movies but I've come to the realisation that I don't really get anything out of either of those and I just use them as a way to forget about the present. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of that I want to get into the habit of doing things that make me happy or that I would actually enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's an easy to do, always accessable (i.e not stargazing or penguin watching because those can't always be done) activity that i could do?"
1362,I don’t wanna feel anymore.,"I don’t wanna get back onto my medication because I feel so numb which is something I used to hate but I realize I’d rather feel nothing. Nothing really matters and I don’t wanna feel for no reason. I think without my medication I’ll feel even less, that’s what I want. If I can’t feel I won’t suffer. Wanted to know if anyone could tell me otherwise."
1363,I need to be a part of something,"I feel like I need to be a part of something active. Like a discord server where everyone plays something, or just messes around and photoshops shit, I don’t know. Anything really. But I don’t know where I could find that."
1364,How do I tell someone,I’ve layed off the idea of me being depressed for a long time but after getting drunk to forget I was going to commit suicide and putting a deadline on when I was going to commit suicide I wanna see if I’m depressed. I don’t know what to do
1365,"I feel lost, disconnected. Like I cant relate to anyone.","Im 23..about to turn 24.

Im generally uninterested in celebrities, sports, partying

And when people talk about their friends, boyfriends/girlfriends..I cant relate. I can barely keep a friendship alive longer than a year. I dont know what Im doing. Some wont even last a year. Maybe a few months. Let alone any intimacy with anyone. Ive never experienced it. Anything at all.

I feel fucking alone. Like Im extremely far behind on life experiences. I dont know who to talk to about this or what to do. I feel like its only going to get worse. 

I dont know how to socialize. I dont know how to read body language and a lot of social queues. My Mom made it very hard for me to hangout with any friends. I basically had none. I didnt have a social life when I was a kid. I never partied. Or even went out.

I have no self esteem. I feel like Im ugly. 

Suicidal thoughts are creeping back in. They stopped after highschool. I wouldnt do it..but I hate that its on my mind. I hate that my mind is going towards that."
1366,"this is all over the place, i’m sorry.","please ignore how messy this is, i’m writing writing how i feel:

i wish i could talk about how i felt without feeling so guilty. the idea of saying i have depression makes me feel weak and pathetic, even though i have it diagnosed. i know i have people to talk to, but you can’t really understand something you’ve never felt. it’s hard to explain how i feel without feeling like i’m being dramatic or annoying, even though they’re real. societal pressures on depression make it seem weak and boring, but really i just want the people close to me to understand how i feel without feeling it. my “sadness” comes in waves, i can be happy for months, then suddenly out of nowhere, i’m in the deep state of nothing. this nothing can last for days, or months. i know i don’t have it as bad as others, and for that i’m grateful, but i just wish those close to me could understand, without pity. my “sadness” is weird, i’m not necessarily “sad”, but i’m empty, im nothing, i’m bring because i can’t focus, im crying because the dish won’t fit on the top shelf. my friends all think ill get over it in 20 minutes, but they don’t fucking understand. they don’t understand that my mind is empty but never ending. they don’t understand that i’m here but my brain is thinking of every little thing wrong with me. they don’t understand that i feel so empty and like nothing, but again, i feel everything. i’m crying over the fucking dishes, but i can’t seem to find my emotions when i need them. i can’t seem to find my emotions in an argument, or when my girlfriend is upset at me, in those moments i feel nothing. 

i wish the people closest to me could have a glimpse of what its like in my head, but not feel how i feel. i would never want anyone to feel how i feel. 

some days are great, until i’m alone with my own mind. i’m great all day, enjoying every moment, but i look in the mirror when i get home and see every flaw in my skin, every flaw in my hands. every flaw in my outfit. every flaw in my hair. every flaw. 

those happy days make me feel like i’m not worthy of saying i’m “depressed”. those days make me feel like others have it worse than me, and therefore i don’t deserve those happy days. those days make me feel like i’m not “sad” enough to feel this way. 

i have a great home, a great family, a wonderful life, and therefore i don’t deserve to put myself in that category. these are the reasons i hate saying i’m “depressed”, it’s not that i’m too good for it, too privileged. i feel like i don’t deserve to have those happy days. those happy days make me feel invalid. 

please tell me if you feel this way too, i need to know someone feels the same."

1368,Feeling Overwhelmed This Holiday Season,"I always have a rough time with my depression during the holidays. This year it seems different and I'm not sure what to do about it. It takes all the effort I can possibly muster to get up and go to work in the morning. I can't call out sick because depression isn't a valid reason for not coming to work. I try to talk my husband about what I'm feeling and I feel like I'm talking to a wall. It's gotten to the point that I almost feel resentful towards him.

I try to keep telling myself ""It's only temporary and will go away"" or ""It's just a result of my depression"" or ""It's just the darkness that comes with winter fucking with me again"". However, I've gotten to the point that these reassuring messages aren't helping anymore. I don't know how to make it better and I need to make it better before I give in to those negative thoughts. Sorry if it seems rambling but any advice would be appreciated."
1369,What's it called when..,"You want to just sleep for four days, not talk to anyone and not eat but you actually do it?

That is all. I feel better now but eh not by much"
1370,I have this existential dread about working,Im almost 18 I live in america and im going to college in the next year or so and I have no clue what im going to do. Im dreading collage Because im not rich nor are my parents so im expecting to be in a fuck load of debt. The career im looking into isn't in high demand currently. Im constantly worried that my job choice is going to be a waste of money and leave me bankrupt or homeless. I will have insurance for 8 more years through my dad. I just don't know what to do with my life
1371,This loneliness is genuinely killing me,I'm so depressed and lonely every single day. I have no friends and nobody to talk to. Nobody wants anything to do with me because I'm so uninteresting and hard to talk to. I've actually been in physical pain from my depression recently. I feel awful. I don't even care about my own health. I'm just going to give up completely.
1372,Im being bullied at school and I don’t want to go tomorrow because it makes me feel worse and makes me mad.,"I don’t want to tell my dad or mom, I’m thinking about telling the principal because this is really killing me, but I don’t want to make the situation worse. Why me? Why am I your target? I just want to be alone😞"
1373,My mom's pride,"Today my mother asked me what my grades are in economy which I said were 7 and 6 (in reality they're like 5 and 4) and she procedeed to yell at me , call me a idiot , a dumbass and just threw ""fuck you"" after ""fuck you"" on and on.She told me I deliver too little for what I get (which is a bad argument because she always asks me what I want , if you think I don't deserve those things , don't give them to me , easy peasy , don't just give them and bitch about how useless I am).She said I'll have a shitty life and I agree , and I don't want to have a life at all , I just want to die at 20 or 25 , I don't care about anything. (Guess I have 2 more years to live so it's not that much to wait haha , I'm 18 if anyone cares).When I do good I'm an angel and her love and when I fuck up I'm suddenly shit and a spawn of satan?I wish this bitch wore a condom."
1374,Scared,I’m a senior in high school with still no idea what I’m gonna do after high school because I honestly didn’t think I’d make it this far I’m scared of what the future will bring I don’t wanna be on the streets and idk where I was going with this I just need advice
1375,Sleep and Dreaming,"I've made a few posts about my sleeping recently. I've been having lucid dreams (when you are aware you are dreaming and have control over you body/environment etc. ). They've been pretty upsetting, because I've been reliving past trauma an I know I can stop it in the dream, but I just let it happen to me, all over again. What's wrong? I hate going to bed now, afraid of dumbass nightmares that I get. Makes me feel bad about myself, knowing that the only reason they're happening is because of me and my brain."
1376,Losing my will to live,i have less of a reason to be alive everyday. I feel like my life is so pointless. I do nothing all day. I always feel awful and it feels never ending. Its like theres always a part of me that feels like shit. Constantly. I never feel that happy and I just miss how I used to feel. I'm only alive so people in my life wouldn't have to deal with grief but thats becoming less important to me everyday. I feel hopeless. I feel lost and alone. I don't know what to do. I just want to feel better. I dont want to be alone anymore.
1377,Not sure what I feel,Im really empty i guess. I don’t feel much anymore I don’t have close friends I moved from my home state to another thinking that would help but it didn’t. I really struggle every day. It I would never let those around me know. I’d rather struggle in silence than let my family and friends know that I feel like this. Is this normal? What should I do? Any advice or help would really help.
1378,I wish I felt some sort of emotions,"I'm a 25 year old male. Never had much care for anything not even myself. 
Never had a real relationship with a girl or with family. 
Idk what it is I just never saw the appeal. 
I'm a good pretender but I just hate who I am when I'm alone."
1379,I need advice,"Okay I don’t know where to begin so I’m jumping right in. I’m married I have 2 kids. I got with my husband back in 2002 when we were kids and we had many breaks in between, involuntary and voluntary, but started dating again in 2007 first baby in 09 and married in 15 and second baby in 16. When we were dating I found out about his cheating. I had the cell phone and I allowed him to use it and I heard voicemails from other girls about them meeting up and whatever. So I knew it was going on. Found condom in my backseat he said it was because of his friend. I am no dummy but I was so head over heels so I took the lie and went with it. Fast forward some and he went to jail and I cheated. I was 21 and I was hurt by his cheating and I also wasn’t ready to settle I guess. I was confused. Then I got pregnant in 09 with our first born. We fought. My oldest daughter is a true miracle. She was so tough to survive and she made me survive for her! But I was stupid and never left. I knew so much of his continued cheating but never left. I was happy until i thought of his cheating. But over all the years I knew I never cheated back. Saw the girls pictures in the phones saw the messages and still stayed. I’m stupid. 2016 I was pregnant and he was always fussing at me and putting me down. Told me so much mean things I would cry constantly. Did he care ? No. Was I stupid for staying? HELL YES!  He wouldn’t come home at night and one night he didn’t come home until after 3 pm the next day. Wouldn’t answer or text back. Came home with what looked like cum on his shirt. He denied it I knew it. Stupidity won again. Fast forward to 2019 I found him cheating. He had girls in the new house we bought a few months before and I saw the evidence of that 2 times. He was at a hotel with a girl. Tracked him there from the uconnect out 2018 cars had. He wouldn’t open the door. He protected this other girl. He fussed at me and made me leave after showing my ass. He wouldn’t open that door! Ugh! That was in March 2019 and I kept having that pain inside me from that. I  did something I NEVER do and i confided in someone else at my work. Then it turned to a different form of friendship. We started sleeping together. He was married and I was married and we shouldn’t have done what we did. We talked daily and then my husband found out. He went to my work to confront him and it turned violently ugly. We said we wanted to work it out and then we didn’t then we did and so on so on but I’m severely depressed because 1) I have depression 2)I’m bipolar (he always thought it was a joke and discouraged me from taking care of myself ) and he constantly torments me about what I did. I’m all the names in the book. I’m a awful mom and woman and nothing about me is good anymore. He does not even acknowledge that he has been cheating on me for years! And that he protected someone else over me. Everyday he has something negative to say. He hates my body now ( I have a nice body but a slight baby pouch ) he hates everything about me. When he found out about my cheating he held me down and cut my hair off . He did that twice. I had to go cut all my hair off to make it right again. I didn’t press charges because he begged me not to. I never have and i should have 100s of times. The sheriff has asked me to. They have pictures of bruises all over me and broken fingernails. Then have the Snapchat of him cutting my hair. He posted all my hair. I wanted extensions in my hair because I miss my hair being lovely and long and I did it and he talked so much crap to me about it until I took it out. I told him how much it would make me happy and he took it all away from me. Made me feel so worthless and empty. He made me throw away my clothes and underwear. He made me do so much but he has done nothing. He lets me know DAILY I am nothing and he tried turning my girls against me by telling them so much they don’t need to know. He is a awful person. I want to get away. I keep myself alive because I love my children so much. They are keeping my feet planted on this earth. They are innocent and beautiful souls. They are my EVERYTHING!!!! I don’t know what to do. We share this house and he won’t leave. He makes it all my fault. I wish I could post screenshots of his texts but I won’t. But if I don’t answer my phone he threatens me with other women but if he didn’t answer it’s just oh well. I don’t talk to him like he talks to me. He talks crap about EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY CAN talk crap about and he constantly throws my cheating in my face but can’t take me talking about him. I need advice on how to hell to handle this. I’m scared. Please."
1380,I wish I had a better brain and tired harder in school,"I went to school on and off for about 7 years now. I'm still a junior and I failed all my classes last semester. I guess I could go back, but I hated school. I'm still behind in my classes and I failed so many of my classes. I'm running out of financial aid and I'm already neck deep in debt. I didn't even really like my major, so I just felt like dropping out would have been the better option. I'm working 6 days a week now at 2 different restaurants in order to pay the bills. I can't do this forever. I'm only 26 and my body is already getting hurt. My mind is getting worse. All the people at my new job are from the ages of 17-22. I feel like such a loser working with them. I feel like they don't really like me and I also feel like they think I'm a loser because I'm in my mid 20's and still fucking up in life. 

I told my family that I was going to get an IT cert (A+ certification), but I'm not even sure if I'm smart enough for that. Like I'm just a fucking dumb person who has a hard time learning shit. I also have major social problems and make myself look even dumber. Everyday I wake up, I feel like I'm getting closer to just ending it all. Everyone I went to high school with is getting their degrees, working real jobs, getting married, buying homes and going on vacation with their new family. 

Like fuck, man. I feel like a waste of a person. Like I'm so fucking useless. I really can't see myself working a real job with normal functioning adults or just being a normal person."
1381,just staring at this create a post screen and I don't even know anymore,"all that i can think of rn is the fact that i need to buy some heroin somewhere and die soon

1382,today i coped with depression by writing a song about it,"this isn't promotion, i don't have aspirations as a musician. this was just very therapeutic, and i'm putting this out there for anyone that cares to commiserate  [https://lipstickpiglatin.bandcamp.com/track/psych-ward-karaoke](https://lipstickpiglatin.bandcamp.com/track/psych-ward-karaoke)"
1383,So tired of my life,"My entire life has basically gone to Hell in the past two months. My ex was treating me like absolute crap, ended that, while dealing with her threats of suicide if I went through with it, she never did it but shut off her phone as soon as I ended it, so I spent the entire night worrying that I made her kill herself which hurt me like hell, she ended up turning everyone around me against me. I got bombarded with questions, got bullied for things I didn't do. Nearly got the police involved because she basically started telling people I sexually abused her. I found someone who I thought would be better for me and who would actually love me, she cheated on me within the first 2 weeks of the relationship, ended that. Stayed lonely and single for a few weeks after that, fell in love with someone else, we dated for maybe 3 weeks before she told me she wanted to stay friends. Realized that I'll be alone basically my entire life, no one, no matter who they are, will ever f**king love me back except for the one day I decide to stop loving. I'll pass up my chance in fear of getting hurt again and again. That first person that made me think she killed herself made me worry about that MORE THAN ONCE before then and it was f**king traumatizing to the point that I developed my own mental illnesses, now I'm stuck being a depressed, suicidal fat pile of crap that would be better off dead and people still think it's a good idea to pile on more stress. It's as if my obvious cries for help are never heard. People see my glassy eyes. People see the occasional tear roll down my face because I have so much built up that I can't even hold in so much as a tear. I'm so damn tired of my life, I just wish it would somehow give me even a sliver of hope or just end already. I don't feel any self-worth and I've lost all humanity to the point that the concept of death is the only thing that can bring a smile to my face. I need some f**king help and Reddit does a better job than my own family and friends."
1384,"I’m tired of people on social media, Twitter and Tik Tok especially, romanticizing depression/anxiety and trying to make it seem ‘cute’ or ‘quirky.’ Trigger Warning!","Depression and anxiety aren’t cute. 

It’s not cute when I’m so depressed that it’s hard for me to get out of bed for any other reason than to let my dog out. 

It’s not cute when anxiety makes me stomach so knitted that I have to throw up before dates, presentations, etc. 

It’s not cute when you lose friends because you shut them out due to the fact that you don’t want to burden them with your issues. 

It’s not cute when it becomes a struggle to even take a shower. 

It’s not cute when I get home from work and sit in my car for 20 mins and cry because of how overwhelmed I am. 

It’s not cute when you entertain whether suicidal thoughts on a daily basis while others make jokes about wanting to die. 

I’m so tired of this people making it seem like some little quirk."
1385,Need Help,"Hey!

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on a nice way to commit suicide. I have a nice quiet place but not a lot of means right now. I don’t have a gun or even a knife. I don’t remember a time I was not suicidal and I think it’s time to end the misery of my friends and family who have been dealing with this meaningless bullshit for decades. I don’t have children and can leave everyone who cares for me much more better off if I’m dead, so I don’t need help rethinking, just help escaping the never ending depression and self hatred that is life.

I really appreciate all advice and comments on the best way to off myself! Thank you!"
1386,anyone else sleep only because they don't want to be awake?,"tired of struggling as an engineering student, recently changed majors and schools and feel so isolated. I know i am interested in the classes and career, but so tired of struggling to keep up with major depressive hanging over me. Very draining knowing i have the potential but constantly being told i have no reason to be depressed."
1387,I am indifferent to my own life. I worry that one day I will be indifferent about other's and will let them down.,"I wonder if anyone else feels the same:

When I say I am indifferent to my own life, I mean that I don't see the value in one's life. What's the point? The body wants to survive until it dies, and then all is gone. I know that religions offer comfort in having a goal in life (heaven and the likes), and I don't want to blindly follow a concept to comfort myself. Sometimes I wish I was born when life was more difficult so I would not have time to ponder over it. Times when your path was decided at birth and you did not have the luxury to think about it.

Right now, I realized that being comfortable is a dangerous zone for me. I must always strive  to get in a zone of discomfort to have to keep my mind occupied. I also work to make my family proud and no disapoint friends.

 These are all meaningless though, and one of my biggest fear right now is that I will one day 100% embrace that the opinion of others don't matter, that their emotions don't matter in the big scheme of things. And that, that one day, I'll just disapear, or kill myself, or go crazy.

Does anybody else feels the same? Is that depression?"
1388,I feel so exhausted.,"I feel so tired. Life is just physically and mentally exhausting at this point. I just want to die already so I don’t feel this boring, empty, tiredness that won’t go away. I feel fake. Nothing feels real anymore. Everything feels like a simulation, like an illusion. I am so tired from life itself. Life just drained every bit of emotion and feeling out of me at this point. School is exhausting, going home is exhausting. Almost everybody is just so annoying, especially at my school. It’s hard to even survive a day at school. Everyone there is so annoying, and won’t leave me alone. My parents are also annoying as shit. They wonder why I don’t even want to talk to them when they’re so fucking annoying. All my anger towards the world itself, coupled with the monotonous, and boring school and home life, just made me want to end it. I am just so tired, lonely. I want peace. I hope I am killed or I am able to find a way to kill myself because I don’t know how to go on at this point."
1389,Is there a rehab for depressed people,I need it. Seriously. I just need to go somewhere that I can be around people and feel enlivened again. I am so miserable and alone.
1390,I see a ton of edgy depressed kids posting stuff like “I lost all of my serotonin when I was 12” and “All I want for Christmas is more serotonin.” Wouldn’t it be better to ask for more dopamine? It seems like dopamine would make life much more satisfying and rewarding than serotonin.,
1391,Is it normal to think no one likes you?,Every day I go to school I see everyone so much more happier than me and I feel like no one wants to talk to me. I have friends and I like to think people like me but it's hard for me to believe that at times. Anyone else like this?

1393,"Not getting diagnosed, should i even look for help anymore ?","I’ve had 3 psychiatrists. First one i had when i was 14, she was good and she listened to my symptoms and gave me appropriate medicine. Enough so that after a year i stopped going to her and my therapist at the time. Fast forward to me turning 18, depressed, dropped out of college, no job. The most critical stage in my life and after seeing two different psychiatrists this year, i feel like giving up. One of the psychiatrists kept giving me medicines that didn’t work, told me he wouldn’t be able to help me. I asked him why and he told me because i should’ve been better after 4 weeks. Went to another psychiatrist and she barely helped. Told her i was 50/50 about killing myself and she upped my dosage. Where the fuck can i get an actual diagnosis and the help i need"
1394,Do I even have depression?,"It's an immense amount of self hatred and worthlessness. But at the same time my body acts as if I'm peachy keen. Laughing with my friends and doing all kinds of stuff. And on the inside I feel hollow and I keep telling myself that I dont feel those emotions of happiness, sadness, anger. Bi polar could be the word but.. idk.. I've begun to doubt my own mind and personality, I feel like I'm not in control of this body anymore, and I'm driven by something else that just eats away at me like a parasite. 

I sometimes just want to die, because of how worthless I am. But is that depression?

My mother told me that depression is being sad all the time and only that. Idk anymore...

I feel like I'm nothing in the face of everyone else, like an annoying nuisance that should shut up and deal with the pain.

I'm too afraid to talk to anyone about this... I'm fearful for my life in a way... what a fucking contradiction I am...

I just wish all this would stop, and I could breath, and be free from my body... my body and mind are lonely... I want to talk to someone again, really talk to someone... I want them to see me for who I am.."
1395,Tonight’s Thoughts,"First post and I can’t believe is depressing! I’m not sure why when I am at my calmest my anxiety decides to knock..Nights are terrifying, shut eyes for seconds give me flashes of negative thoughts, guilt and shame..I dealt with depression but it comes in wave..Like maybe a month something terrible happened to me wether it was a year ago or so it seems to remind me over again and get me back to that dreadful mood of wanting to stay in and do absolutely nothing..God how I hate bed time!! I wish one night I am not overthinking or crying myself to sleep because I lose control of my thoughts..Suicide chats are terrrible !!! The wait is more likely help you faster in hanging yourself before an agent even gets to you ! Their system should change, because not that anyone is always suicidal  when they go to these online chat is just an outlet to speak to someone to get by for the night when you can’t do it yourself !! Okay now I feel better venting ! Maybe I’ll actually can now go to fuck to sleep !"
1396,I don’t see any way out.,I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I can’t even see the tunnel. Just dark clouds and heavy air weighing me down. Life is going good. My head is not. It hasn’t been. Over 15 years and nothing has helped. I feel like quitting is my only option. I want it stop. I just want it to stop.
1397,I can’t feel anything,There is this weird feeling of emptiness in my stomach. I can’t seem to feel anything.
1398,I feel like I've been on a rollercoaster with short highs and stomach turning drops for 8 years,Everytime I have a small achievement I feel like I plummet downwards into a spiral of helplessness. I'm running out of energy. I'm worried one day I won't come back up.
1399,Panic Attack,"I can’t stop hyperventilating. I am trying so hard to improve my health and I’m so weak all the time. I recently got broken up with for something I can’t control. No matter how selfless I am to the people around me, I’m overlooked and ignored. I’m all I have and yet others take so much from me that I have nothing in me left for myself. I’m so trapped and I don’t have the self esteem or self love to even save myself. At this point I think I’m gonna die. Not because I want to. I really want to live. But I think my body is giving up even though I’m only 25 because of all the stress in my life. 

I can’t stop my panic attack."

Today I was feeling overwhelmed with life and had casual thoughts of suicide and hurting myself. They weren’t as serious as pervious times but I was still scared. I didn’t want to die but I was just tired of everything. Tonight I texted a crisis text line and although not everything went away and not everything was magically fixed I feel SO much better. If anyone is wondering it was crisistextline.org"
1402,Am I depressed? (I’m not sure where to post this I’m somewhat new to Reddit),"Hi 
I’m not sure where to post this, I’m also quite “new” to reddit so I’m not sure where to post questions like these but at this point I just need to get it out somewhere

I’m an 18, almost 19, year old male and ever since January 2019 I’ve seen my life fall to pieces and I don’t know how to start getting better or what to do.

It all started in January 2019, first with the increase of workload because of the ever approaching exams in May(I took the IB Programme). Not only that but my gf that I really liked broke up with me after a year of dating (although I feel that that relationship was somewhat of an emotional abuse towards me by the last 4 months with the way she treated me) with the stress of the workload and the sadness of my girlfriend leaving me somewhat broke me in early 2019. Although I tried to get back up I couldn’t. My grades before were average and I attended clubs such as MUN, a cancer awareness club, and a club that worked together with an Animal shelter. I also used to go to the gym and made good progress to become a better me. After all that happened in early 2019 my grades plummeted and I closed off my social life and i stopped attending clubs or working out. I started drinking at one point weekly for about 5 weeks. It got to a point where I was able to down half a liter of vodka with energy drinks in about 15-20 minutes. I started smoking heavily because I didn’t know how to even start back up again. My May exams rolled through and I didn’t do as well as I wanted to. This broke me further, not only that but the knowledge that I disappointed my parents to no end. This broke me. I gained weight and throughout the summer drinking alone became a regular occurrence. The thought of suicide also started to plague my mind. It would linger for weeks and then disappear for a few days and the cycle would repeat. After Highschool I didn’t really have anyone to turn to. I stopped going out (but this started in February-March 2019) and stopped socializing. I would chose to stay in my room and just contemplate suicide. The drinking didn’t help although I felt that drinking was the only way to speed up the day to day life I was living, I’m not sure where I thought it would go or end but I wasn’t really concerned with it. It was more of a though of trying to get to tomorrow so I could drink alone again. I tried to quit smoking in September, which worked until December where these thoughts eventually made me start smoking just for that rush of a small high I got. I did LSD 5 or 6 times during my summer (but the last time I did it made me realize just how much I wanted to jump through the 4th story window) and I smoked weed on a regular basis (every 2-3 days) I thought it would get better over time but I’ve just seen myself descending into loneliness. I started thinking of ways to actually go through suicide and the effects it would have on the few people that are still around me. (I was never really close to my family and I was always a “trouble maker” as a teenager). I’ve never gone to a doctor and I guess it’s because I’m scared to go through it alone. Where I come from having depression leads to you being looked down upon as weak or you get told to just stop being sad. I can’t turn to my family because I don’t want to disappoint them with the thought that their son is actually a useless and worthless person. And I’m turning to the last place I can think for help, Reddit. I don’t know what to do or how to even continue going through this. I respect everyone that is going through it and seeking help but there are times where I just don’t want to seem vulnerable and reach out for help with the few people that are around me because I’m scared it’ll drive them away. 

I’m sorry for the long post and if you made it this far I thank you."
1403,I'm so tired,"I'm so tired and want to die. I'm so fucking exhausted and just want to sleep. I don't want this anxiety and sadness anymore, just let me sleep."
1404,Existing hurts me,Something in my brain wont let me be comfortable in my skin i cant  even leave  the  house without panicking anyone  relate  i have so many mental issues i just want the pain to stop
1405,I have dreams,I have dreams of you asking me better questions. Your desire to know more makes the love feel fuller. Then I open my eyes and you’re never as curious as I want.
1406,Little Did They Know,"She screamed and wept,  all at once
Which made those folks confused hence.
They called her a mess; an emotional wreck, 
Little did they know her heart was at wreck.

She smiles too dull; her laughs so rare,
Talks were forced,  but little did she care.
Her body all scarred and mind perplexed, 
Little did they know of her tale unheard.

The dreams much vague, and her battles with sleep, 
Her fears do make her cling so deep.
She tries a fake smile, but her eyes bleed,
Come out of thy shell, they shriek, they plead.
But little did they know her struggle was real.

She ate too much or nothing at all,
She slept all day or not at all..
Her hands trembling,  her vision too blurred,
She wishes to speak but stammers at end.
Little did they know her story was true.

[You are not alone.. I am there too. Others won't understand or they seriously don't want to:) but it's okay ..we will gradually heal and come back to life smiling]"
1407,I hate the fact that I’m writing this.,"I used to think that you really had to be at such a low point in your life, to go post about all your personal issues.

How ironic.

And before I start on this rant about myself, I’d like to say that I don’t want your pity or sympathy. I’m not posting this to get attention or make people feel bad for me. 

That’s not it. 

I’m just upset with the world. And I want to know if others feel the same way. 

So here’s my story.

For a long time, I never realized that my family was....a bit different from the rest. And as a young kid, how could I have known? But as I started getting older I noticed that most kids had this bond with their parents that I never had. It was like...they could tell them anything and everything. For me that was such a strange concept. My parents were like my ‘authorities’. I respected them and did what I was told. There were no ‘feelings’ involved. 

As I continued to grow up, I noticed that other families did things that mine didn’t. For instance, my best friend’s family ate dinner together and talked. That was so bizarre to me. Normally when dinner time rolled around, my brother and I preheated frozen food from the freezer and ate in front of the tv while my parents screamed at each other in the kitchen.

Oh and another thing. 
The screaming.

My parents screamed at each other every waking moment of the day. Sometimes, if they were really stressed, they also screamed at us. But I was happy because as long as they didn’t hit us, we were fine.  I was scared that their anger would escalate to where they would hit us. And that usually never occurred.

But the hitting did.

My mom and dad hit each other. When that happened , my brother and I always looked away because it was too painful to watch the tears and angry words.

So what about now? Well my mom is never home because of work and my dad has very severe anger issues so we leave him alone.

I guess the reason I’m writing this is because my situation isn’t anybody’s fault. My mom had abusive parents and my dad was kicked out of the house when he was young. 

So why did this have to happen? Why does it feel like the best people in the world have to suffer the most? 

I don’t know.

And that sucks."
1408,Anyone ever just ignore certain things?,"Ever become so numb to different life situations and predicaments, the only thing you can really do is ignore stuff? Like i have text I haven’t bothered opening, mail I haven’t torn open yet, missed calls that I haven’t returned and somehow I just feel kind of good about it. I even logged out of my social media accounts and totally isolated myself from the cyber world.. Even though I feel I’m losing friends, I guess I just rather be alone."
1409,"Bought some hemp oil 50,000 mgs",It arrived today and I just took my first dose. It says it helps with mood support so I'm looking forward to it and hopefully I can get more rest
1410,I think I’m depressed,My friend tried to kill herself while I wasn’t talking to her then she started cutting herself while I wasn’t talking to her again so I feel like a piece of shit. Beat up my friend and my mom found out so now can’t be friends and lost the chance of getting fucked up with friends and having fun all of sophomore year so I’m feeling like I’m missing out. And I can’t bring myself to do homework then get bad grades and have my parents get disappointed in me and say I’m turning into a bad kid. Sometimes I feel like I should date someone and then I don’t. And I just generally feel burned out 24/7 after doing nothing.
1411,Do you ever just miss the vibrant colors of life?,"Over a month ago I've been in a funk. Before then I was extremely happy. Had a great relationship. My job was tolerable for a time, and I managed to get some things done. Stuff that had been needed doing for a while.

I noticed that the world looked brighter. Colors were more vibrant. Everything just popped out more. Now, it's like... nothing stands out. Colors are dull, and everything is just meh to my eyes. I miss seeing the world in that way."
1412,I’m not that girl(depression poetry),"I’m not that girl, not anymore.
I’m not that girl that was always happy.
I’m not that girl who had a crush on that boy. 
I’m not the girl that you sat with at lunch. 
I’m not that girl who didn’t bury her feelings. 
That girl got lost a long time ago.
That girl drowned in who I am. 
The girl that feels pressured by society. 
I’m a different girl. 
I’m the misfit, the one that only a few dare talk too. 
I’m that girl who wants to hide away from everyone. 
I’m not who I used to be.
I’m different now. 
I know what society is like.
Sometimes I want that girl back. 
But I’m not her, not anymore."
1413,They removed curfew for soldiers in Korea,"I have always suffered from depression and anxiety from a young age but have never felt the way I did after leaving Korea. When I was stationed in Korea we had a Curfew and needed to be back in our place of residence from 1-5 a.m. after 11 months and only being a month away from leaving and being stationed back at Fort Bragg my unit decided it was time for me to go to a promotion board. I stayed in for four weeks straight and studied as I saw myself staying in the Army for some time. The promotion board finally came and I nailed it and I have never been happier. This was a Wednesday so on Friday my closest friends and fellow soldiers decided to surprise me and take me out for a few drinks since I have denied them my company for the last month. We ended up staying out past curfew...not on purpose we just lost track of time. I noticed and proceeded to tell my friends that we were in the wrong part of Korea and needed to get out of the city for the night or we would get caught. They asked me to sit down as it was to late to anyways. I advised my friends that we should leave right then and there and they trusted me. We didn’t get two feet out the door before being stopped by Korean Police escorted by an Army captain looking for soldiers out after curfew. We all got in trouble of course. After just passing the promotion board 48 hours prior to be eligible to be a sergeant I was  demoted to an E1 with 45 days extra duty. Due to my time in service I needed to be an E4 by the time I hit 6 years and with my time in service I would only need 6 months to reach E4 once again. I realized that I would hit 6 years five months into my punishment which would relieve me of service and end up being sent home. I fought for my right and ended up getting a meeting with a 2 star General to plead my case and ask to not be relieved of service. (NOTE: I had never been in trouble prior to this incident). I was a decent soldier and worked hard to get where I was. The general denied my appeal and said I was not fit for duty and sent me home. My entire career in the military means nothing and I feel nothing but sadness when I look back at a time that should have been my best years in life. I’m literally in my bed right now about to go to bed and decided to pick up my phone and scroll through Facebook and ended up seeing the article stating that they removed the curfew permanently. This has sent me into an anxiety attack and I feel the sadness creeping in. Knowing that I lost everything for something that doesn’t even exist anymore is mind blowing. I know this post is long but I just needed an outlet because I can fee my heart beating and it feels like it’s going to blow out my chest. This incident has definitely caused me to have PTSD as I can’t watch military movies anymore and I no longer hang any military plaques or medals in my home. Everything about the military saddens me as it makes me fee that I failed myself, my family, my fellow soldiers where 1 other was also relieved from service and my pride. The military was everything to me and because I was out late I was kicked out. I was 30 years old and celebrating. It was a simple mistake and I lost everything I ever worked for due to a curfew that no longer exist. I literally feel sick to my stomach. It has been two years since I was relieved of service and I still have nightmares, panic attacks and have been suicidal. I don’t know what to do but just keep typing....I’m now 33 and this makes me as sad as ever......"
1414,Going Downhill,"Everything is Awful

***Trigger Warning:
I have been going through a lot of awful shit lately. I honestly feel like I’ve become a burden on my family. It’s really hard - I have to take the disappointed looks and passive aggressive comments all of the time. 

I’ve become really preoccupied with my SO’s shotgun. I’ve never done anything and don’t know how to even use it, but I think about it just sitting in the closet. I don’t wanna say anything because we don’t live in a good area. We need the protection,  but I’m so scared of myself."
1415,given up,"So i have quit my job, i have told ""friends"" i don't want to be friends anymore, quit social communities, told a guy i was seeing to get lost.

i give up trying, i'm just destined to be alone. everyone that has anything to do with me either gets annoyed with me or my depression brings them down / drives them away so why try anymore"
1416,sister/nation and what i can only describe as my spiral to insanity,"thats why im pure to some. a psychopath to others / *(voices in my head)* they just grew louder and louder / i juggle all my personalities / estoy tan harto y cansado, no puedo seguir haciendo esto Ojalá pudiera rendirme / i don't care what they call me / i see you *(them)* peekin' through bushes / second guessing my descisions / i feel like all my days are coming to rubble

1417,Why did I have to be born,I'm currently suffering from depression anxiety and ADHD. But the thing is the only thing that I have been diagnosed with fully is ADHD. The reason for that it because whenever I talk to someone I just try to hide the fact that I am also they dint have to pity me or worry about me and I even to it with counselors so they cant really diagnose me with it. So basically the reason I believe to why I became how I am is because when I was younger like younger than 6 young my dad used to beat me my mom and my brother and all of that caused me to start pulling my hair out in 1st grade this caused me to have no real friends my entire life even now and my dad whenever I would cut my hair he would punish me by beating me and doing haircut punishments this caused to to get severely bullied my entire life. But I had coping methods I started coping my doing good work and being the top student in the district at that time. That was until middle school when everyone started doing drugs and I would have to do peoples homework or else they would beat me up. This caused my grades to go down and my dad would start beating me more severely. And the thing with depression and ADHD is that I dont know how but when I am around people I just dot act overly hyper but when I am alone i start moving around like crazy some of the time the moving can last for up to around 8 to 9 minutes. But as of now I'm 16 still kinda pull my hair but since I've stopped my anxiety has gone through the roof and I now have no friends and the people I try to hang out with make fun of me daily and am now an f student I heard one of my teachers call me a failure when he thought I wasn't there.
1418,My friend called me ugly inside and out,You said it was a joke but why did you say it that way? I’m tired. I guess you’re right.
1419,A life without meaning,"This is my very first post here in Reddit itself. I dont know where to start.
I just wanted to share whats been going on my mind. For years now. Maybe someone here might relate and understand me. English is not my forté, so please bear with me.

I havent tried going to any any Mental Health Doctors since its too expensive and from where I was brought up to, mental health is something to laugh about. Something that they just heard, known, but not really, put in their mind into.

Since I was a kid, as early as I can remember, Ive been dreaming of dying. Im not really in good terms with my family at that time. Im the youngest one, next to me is my brother, who's one my enemy, and there's my eldest sister, who became my second mom.
I know its normal for siblings to fight, but on what I have experienced, I think its the biggest factor why I never wanted to live. I believe I was only 6 or 7 maybe younger, and I always thought to myself that no one ever love me other than my sister.

As I grew older, the fights never went away. Adding the physical and verbal abuse from my parents. We go to church every Sunday. That is also why I loathe my parents before, since how can they 'praise God', lift up their hands and cry before the Lord, when after we go home. They will start saying foul words and hurt their kids so bad. My mom even said to my face that she regret bringing me to this world, that she shouldve killed me when I was still a baby. My dad, tried took advantages of me, attempted to sexually abuse me. My brother, always hated me. When I was in 6th grade, before the graduation, he punched me several times on the face, so when I went to school the next day. Half of my face was full of bruise. No one ever helped me. There was even one pastor, who gained my trust, I thought he will really help me out, but in the end, he aswell tried to take advantage of my young mind, trying to do sex over the phone, but he never succeeded on touching me.

From then, I started hurting my self. Bit by bit, praying every night for God to take me. (My thoughts are jumbled, I cant tell my stories in order, sorry). 
I know its a sin to take one's life. Thats why I just pray for him give me some illness that will just kill me. Whenever I ride the bus or anything, there's always the hope for me to be in an accident. It would be freedom. Until now, I really dont know why would God let someone like me to live. Why He would protect me from every danger. There were lots and lots of accident around me, lots of people die every day, but why cant it be me? Why do I need to keep on living, there are other people that is more worthy to live. So why save me? I just wanted to disappear. I just wanted to die. Why cant he let me die."
1420,I don't know anymore,"I can't process the emptiness I'm feeling at this point. Treating it feels ridiculous and worthless, all fo the people I look up to have been uttffingme down recently. There just doesn't seem like any reason to keep going. But every day I dont take my life is a victory as far as I'm concerned, even if I dont feel like continuing."
1421,I can't stop eating,
1422,Does anyone ever get the feeling that they're not going to live a long life?,"TL;DR: I don't think I'm going to live long

I have PTSD mixed with some clinical Major Depression.  I have a hard time saying no to some of my emotions.  When I get angry I let my anger loose.  When I get sad, I let the emptiness consume me.  It's hard to stop.  

I dont want to be like this anymore.  It hurts me more than it hurts others sometimes.  

I was abused in my household growing up for 8 years.  I started around this time last year (26 yrs old) getting help.  But sometimes it doesnt feel like it's enough.  I feel like I cant stop these emotions and it's going to get me killed by someone I lash out at and has nothing to lose by killing me

Or by my own hand.  I feel the pressure of it both coming on stronger and stronger as the years go by.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do but I what I do know is I cant keep emotionally damaging myself and others.  

I've left alot of ruin in my path in life.  If I could take it back I would.  But theres something inside that's always telling me to take the plunge.  To say this and do that.  

You guys ever feel like life is pulling you into a certain direction?  Well...I dont think mine ends well."
1423,Nobody has any control over their destiny,"If everyone is a God, with control over their own destiny, then nobody is. We all have the ability to put an end to someone's destiny, and vice versa. At any moment you could be the victim of a drunk driver, the next shooting (more probable in America), mugging, anything! That person can snuff out your entire supposed ""destiny"" in the blink of an eye. Human life is a worthless and cruel joke. The most horrific act you can committ on this earth is to reproduce."
1424,I’m getting the why me feeling,"Depression sucks. I wish I could at least understand why this had to happen to me. I am not here to brag, but I’ve always been a good friend, daughter and partner. I don’t judge people, I don’t envy people, I don’t hate anyone . I just hate myself. It sucks to be unable to understand that you too are a human being that deserves to breathe. I’m tired of crying and hating myself"
1425,Tears(depression poetry),"Sometimes, tears are shed for joy. 
Not for me, not in a long time.
I cry for the girl that I used to be.
I cry for the life I could have had if I wasn’t me. 
I cry because I can no longer see the  light.
I cry because I’m not who I want to be. 
I cry because I’m down in a hole with no one but myself. 
I cry because of the thoughts running rampant in my head. 
I cry because no one knows me.
I cry because I’m not brave enough to tell someone what’s wrong.
I cry because I fake it all day.
I cry because I am broken. 
I cry because I only hope I can be fixed."
1426,I want to start self-harming.,"I might be saying this for attention but at the same time, I'm looking for legit techniques on self harming. I would prefer to do it on my thighs. I just tried to use a razor blade but it was cheap and it didn't cut. What do you use?"
1427,My low self esteem is debilitating,"I really don't know how to explain it in detail. It's been this way for years and I don't know any other default mindset. Words of kindness no longer have meaning and I even try to rationalize those kind words in a way that will make me hate myself even more. Anytime I can't do something right I tell myself I'm fucking garbage, a maggot, a plague to those that care for me. It's gotten to the point where I just want someone to beat the shit out of me because I deserve it. I deserve it for being such a pitiful person, a disgusting human being. 

I push people away because I don't think I deserve to be around them. I feel incredibly inferior most of the time. I put others down to temporarily dull those agonizing thoughts. I would do anything to feel validated. I would lick someones dirty shoes, I would degrade myself, I would do all kinds of shitty things just so I can feel validated. A quick fix for validation. 

It's just ridiculous how I turned out like this. My parents are good people, my brothers excel in almost every aspect of life and I am the black sheep of the family but I deserve to be called a pest and a worm. The fact that I have a supportive family just digs me deeper into my hole because I don't think I should be like this  because of what I have. It really doesn't matter though because it's all internal.

I don't hate myself so much that I want to kill myself or harm myself. It's just painful and torturous."
1428,It really sucks hating yourself so much,"I hate how much I dislike each and every part of myself almost as much as I hate myself. I feel like such a genuinely garbage person and for such base, dumb reasons. I take those individual pieces I hate and see them in other people, and I don't mind them, it's part of them, it's normal, but somehow mirroring back to me it feels warped and awful. 

It feels like I'm wearing a ragged patchwork of skin. It's not that it doesn't feel like me, it's just that I hate it so much. I feel so mad at it. I don't know what to do and it's so awful to have so much hate for a single being, nevermind one you have to deal with for your entire god damn life. It's not even like all this unwarranted, unending anger is purposeful just to annoy those around me.  I almost wish it was. It's such an inconvenience because it's so constant. It either feels embarrassing to have, or annoying. The emotional rollercoaster is such a pain as well. I hate every aspect of it, especially because I don't understand it."
1429,Hope I don’t wake up,"Why is that everyone says it gets better. Nothings really changed even though my life has. I still feel weird and depressed. Work out, hang out with friends; “trust me it gets better”. I try it all but it’s a mask. F me"
1430,Existence is pain?,
1431,I was going to write something but I lack motivation,:)
1432,i think i failed. I dont know what to do.,"I have 5.5 hours to finish my dissettation. Ive done 3.5k words out of 8k as i lost half my work at 9pm. Im shaking and im scared and i have never felt like this before as im pretty sure ive failed my university course. Im sorry
Im not looking for anger im just idk. My emotions are not with me rn. Im feeling pretty down. Please. Help me."
1433,Does anybody else feel like they are still a child and that it gets worse as the days go by?,"I feel about as emotionally mature as a very young child, I look in the mirror and just see a very, very skinny kid with messy hair who could be something much better but has no idea where to start."
1434,Cleaning,"Well. I havent cleaned in months. Im talking garbage everywhere. Grime everywhere. Real gross. Since i had today off due to snow, i decided to clean since i had left over energy. Cleaned my room kinda (7 bags of trash). Cleaned my bathroom kinda (1 bag of trahs and i wiped down all surfaces. Yuck.). Did laundry (5 loads.)

Sure, the bags of trash are still sitting in my room an none of this laundry is getting put away but at least i did it."
1435,are pornographic contents one of the cause of depression?,
1436,Why is my life shit?,"I got an F in Math and English, I have been diagnosed with celiac disease, and have no friends, Meanwhile my brother has everything good grades, pouplar etc.
I feel alone and I don't know want  to do. :("
1437,excessive crying?," whats up,im sophia and im 14
so i’ve had depression for 3 years and have accepted the fact that i’m gonna have it my whole life and i usually have peaks of when i’m most depressed but something that stays the same is the crying,
its so easy for me to cry about the future,my weaknesses and my depression or just anything im sensitive about
i’ve been looking at this subreddit and i saw that a lot of people on here cant cry easily
i don’t know if this is a symptom that depression comes with or its just me"
1438,I don't think im savable,Im scared I don't like to admit it often but I am im sure this will just get buried here under all the post but im at my breaking point. My familys falling to pieces my friends are and have been long gone a girl who I thought I really loved took advantage of me stole my uncles golden chain he left me months before he died and all the money out of my wallet called me a pussy and then started talking to another guy in class and hooked up with him what I felt a couple months ago cannot be put into words I don't understand why being nice forgiving and giving your heart to someone just for them to crush it. Im 14 going on fifteen soon and you can imagine all of the stereotypes getting tossed at me I just want someone to hold in my arms I just want love everyday I see myself fading away into a hateful anger filled person and I don't want this to happen there's so much more bullshit I could fucking spew all over this post but im just gonna stop I don't think I can continue
1439,Anyone else just feel like a shell of their former self?,"I used to be so happy. I was personable, socially capable, and down to earth. Now I feel like the exact opposite of all those things. I can barely function socially anymore, I will let one thought get in my head and torment me for the entire day, and I always have this lingering thought in the back of my head that no one likes me and that I am better off gone, or that everyone who likes me now will eventually hate me because of my changed behaviors. Does anyone else feel this way?"
1440,I don’t want to try to get better because failing will just make me feel worse,"I am not in a good state of mind right now, but I would rather keep it this way rather than making it worse. When I don’t try I at least have hope that if I were to try I could possibly improve myself. But if I were to attempt to get better and I failed, I would feel even more hopeless than before. It will make feel like improvement is impossible. I am not trying, but at least I am not failing."
1441,does life ever get better,"ive been depressed for years and i just want my life to turn around magically but it seems like that wont happen. do you think that one day depression leaves or is it always going to be there? i seriously dont know what to do to make it go away because nothing seems to work. is there any hope? trying to enjoy life is just so hard for me, other people make it look so easy. i just want something better than what i have right now. i just want to fix my life and be the best version of myself. i just cant seem to be interested in anything though. old passions that i used to enjoy have no meaning anymore. i also hate  my occupation but i am forced to work to make money. what is the point of this life that i am living. ending it all would give me peace but i am too afraid of the pain that it would inflict on me and my family. i just hate this world that i am living in. i wish there was some other reality that i could live in that is nothing like this one."
1442,Not even people on here want to even comment on me,
1443,I'm scared.,"January 18th ill be 24. I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I know this is a depressing ass post. Idk if anyone will see this. But typing this makes me feel a tiny bit better, as if I'm talking to someone. I dont know where to start. I've been sick, ever since I was a child. Almsot ten years ago I started having a horrible pain in my feet and as the years went on the pain raised from my feet, all the way up to my thighs, It's constant. Felt like I had been standing on solid concrete for like two days. Just felt like I was standing on the bones of my feet. No cushion, no nothing. As the years went on it got worse and started to rise up from my feet all the way to my thighs. Its constant and horrible. It never goes away. Never eases. My doc put me on morphine, it helped to take the edge off. But nothing else. I lost my insurance at 21 so I can no longer see a proper doctor or any specialists. I am now 23, one month away from being 24.. But I'm scared I wont make it until then. In the past five months I have had pancreatitis four times.
Feels like I'm bout to have it again...
I've spent a 37 days in the hospital over the past five months. I just.. Don't know what to do. I feel like I'm fucked. I fantasize about death. I often fantasize about a stray bullet dropping from the sky and just hitting me right in the head. It'd be kinda nice. Just an eternal sleep. 

The American health care system fucking sucks. 

this might be the wrong sub to post to, idk but I just felt like I needed to vent. 

I just don't known what to do or how much I can last. I mean this shits been going on for as long as I can remember. I don't even remember what it feels like to have legs that don't hurt. I just don't know what to do.

Anyway I'm sorry for me complaining about all my shit. I know that there are people out there who have it way worse than me.. God (or whatever you believe in) bless you."
1444,"I was very excited to have my girlfriend meet my best friends, but that was a horrible idea.","I was told that since I don't talk about my friends at all, it feels as if I really don't have any, or that they are of any importance. It made the encounter so uncomfortable she had a really bad anxiety attack. All I do is wrong, absolutely everything. I want to say I want to die and actually go through with it, because it feels that no matter what I do I will always make the wrong decisions. Everything I do is wrong, all I work for is useless. I feel as if I'm just a thing that should not be and I'm absolutely tired of everything. I wish I could just die from natural causes... I just made my girlfriend uncomfortable towards me, and my friends uncomfortable towards me. these are the only people i have in my life."
1445,I feel like I want to die,"I haven't been diagnosed with depression but i sure as hell feel depressed. (Rant time) All I ever feel like is trash. I was useful to someone at some point but now they are done with me. Both of my sister's (12&amp;16) have something who either has fealings for them(12) or has an actual SO(16)... meanwhile I'm 19 in college and I feel like I'm a pretty decent guy...maybe not on the eyes but who cares about that...I feel invisible to every female on the face of the Earth either that or I'm ""to good of a friend"" or ""like a brother to them"" not one single female on the face of this Earth seams to even see me as more than a friend or even see me at all. The only true friends I feel like myself with is my guys group at my church. Otherwise anywhere and everywhere I'm like one of those Ikea tools that come in the box to build the thing and then get forgoten in a drawer because there are actual tools that are far better than me. I am the worlds disposable tool...and I feel like I want to dispose of the trash...the useless...me"
1446,A question about SSRI's,"I am all wound up - tense - when I drive my knees and legs are clenched. I clench everything, all the time. I've had panic attacks not long ago but this month they seem to be in check. I try to take it easy and not overload my work schedule, relax as much as possible, etc. but I'm still wound up tight. I also believe that I have GERD and a potentially terrible immune system (chest / sinus infections multiple times per year). I also seem to have mild IBS - anything mildly salty or oily will likely send me to the bathroom pretty quickly. 

I'm thinking that this can all potentially be attributed to stress . . my doctor has prescribed me Zoloft for anxiety / panic disorder, but I'm hesitant to jump in. 

Anyone have any advice? I've done a lot (probably too much) research on GERD / LPR, but maybe I should be focusing more attention on how little stress I seem to be able to manage at this point. 

Thanks! :)"
1447,Anyone relate?,"Does anyone else ever have those nights where you have no idea what you want out of life or what you want to do? What you want to achieve or accomplish? Or even if you wanna get up the next day? Nights like these are always the hardest for me and I wish it would get easier. Sometimes it just feels like the only way to stop these thoughts and running away, but that would create more problems. I don’t think I’ve ever felt this crushing feeling of dread and sadness as I think about the future.
It’s a truly aweful feeling and I wish it just end."
1448,I don't know if I have depression,"I'm a 15 year old guy. I get okay grades (Last year I got 5 As 2 Bs and a C) but in the past months ive been feeling quite sad for seemingly no reason. At first I thought it was stress because I had a bunch of projects, but Im not sure now. A week ago I cried in my school bathroom for no reason. I'm pretty sure my mom has depression (I heard her saying to a doctor she was on antidepressants) and i know she was abused a child so im not sure if she has depression or PTSD or something. I heard that your chances of having depression increases by a lot if your parent has it. Im pretty okay most of the time, but I have moments where I get super sad for apparently no real reason. I would appreciate any help in the comments, and ill give you more info if you need it."
1449,Advice for tapering off meds,"Hi, lurker of this sub for about 2.5 years now, since one of my best friends confided in me that he was struggling with depression. When he told me, he had already gone through the worst of it- he had taken a leave of absence from work and had professional help. When he told me about it, he had already tried a couple meds that didn’t seem to do anything but was finally on one that was seemingly working and he said he was feeling more like himself. I was absolutely floored because I had no idea of what he had gone through and because he seemed so together and happy throughout it all. 

It’s been about two years and he’s doing a lot better from where he used to be, although I admittedly had no idea he was depressed. But earlier this week, he told me he is beginning to taper off the dosage of his medication. I suspect it is partly due to finances and partly due to him wanting to feel more in control of his mental health. He asked me to call him out if he starts withdrawing or behaving differently since I know him well and won’t be afraid to do so, but I honestly am worried about this whole thing. 

I know everyone is different, that every friendship looks different, and there won’t be a formula or “right” way to handle everything, but do you guys have any advice for me? What can I expect over the next few days or months as he tapers off his dosage, and any suggestions on how to support him? Also, any words of caution against this in general?

Thanks in advance for your replies. This sub has really strong camaraderie, and I think this support system is really meaningful for a lot of people."
1451,My Partner Has Depression And Has Asked For Space,"I have been with this Girl for 8 months now, we have been an amazing couple, we talked about moving in together, sort of joked about children together we've got a worldwide holiday planned together in March and overall I felt she was the love of my life And I know she felt this too, I've never seen someone look at me the way she did.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going very well until around a month ago

&amp;#x200B;

She suddenly became very subtracted, she didn't want to talk as much or she would duck and weave me. On some days it would be brilliant but on most other days it was hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was long before she ever said she had depression, so to someone who doesn't know you have depression, it felt like I was losing her. Her affection levels dropped dramatically too. So i felt as though I was losing her. I do have anxiety but I usually control it very well but ofcourse, when someone changes drastically, my anxiety flared up a lot. I began to have panic attacks for the first time in 5 years and I went to some pretty bad places. 

&amp;#x200B;

After around 2 weeks of feeling more anxious than i ever have, she finally told me she was in a depressive episode and it all clicked. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent a good week bringing myself back to baseline, I stopped blaming myself for her doing all this stuff, I went to therapy and went back to being happy again 

&amp;#x200B;

I was also releasing my first book during this time so yah, I was under a fuckload of stress which has now subsided.

&amp;#x200B;

We hung out twice since I became better and things seemed Great, I could see her pain and sadness but I was making her smile and laugh, and I was there to give her whatever affection she needed. I felt I could be a rock for her once again and apologised refusely for not seeing the signs prior. And for taking her actions so personally, it's hard to not respond that way when people don't tell you but now I know, I'll never forget it.

&amp;#x200B;

I assumed stuff would be fine from this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Approximately 4 days ago, she came to me after a full day of hanging out and laughing / smiling, and said she believes she doesn't love me as much as I love her, this then turned into her saying "" I don't love you anymore"" which then turned into ""I don't love anyone at the moment"" 

&amp;#x200B;

This seems very odd considering 3 weeks ago we planned and payed for a worldwide holiday together and wanted to move in with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if she wanted to break up with me and she said she didn't know. I then asked if she still wanted to go on the holiday we booked a few weeks ago and she said she thinks so. I also asked if this feeling of her not loving me anymore all started when she became depressed and she agreed it did. I asked if she meant what she said a mere few weeks ago in regards to moving in together and she said she did mean it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agreed to give her time to think, as much time as she needs, I sent her a letter after the discussion, detailing why we got together and why we're together and that I would be infinitely patient with her, I apologised for my anxiety and assured her it has passed and that none of this was her fault and to let herself feel what she needs to. 

&amp;#x200B;

She said she would get back to me within a week. In my personal experience, if you really wanted to break up with someone, you do it. We were in the discussion, I even asked her and gave her a clear out and she didn't take it. But I am understandably nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My question is that, should I be worried? If this actually the end, or is this her depression taking over and trying to cut off all ties with loved ones?

&amp;#x200B;

I literally am head over heels for this girl

&amp;#x200B;

No one has made me feel love like she has and she said felt the same about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am terrified at the moment, terried that I'm going to lose the love of my life because of this vicious disorder

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? Do I just give her as much space as possible? Do I check up on her once a week or something? I just don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am just confused, I just want to be there for her. I don't want to let our love go because of something I know isn't permanent. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just hate myself for not seeing the signs sooner, I am so angry at myself for acting the way I did and not being more understanding."
1452,I don't have the motivation to do literally anything,"Things are getting worse, and worse, and everyday I have less motivation to do things. In the past month I completely lose interest in all of my hobbies, entertainment and activities I once enjoy. In the past few days I lost interest in games, one of the only things that remained. Now I literally just distract myself with memes, or sleeping, or whatever just to pass time, and I feel these things are losing effectiveness as well.

What should I do? It's getting harder and harder to deal with this shit. I don't even know why I'm alive anymore, I literally just distract myself so the time goes away. What I'm waiting for? I don't know. Things are just getting worse."
1453,Not sure how much longer,"I shouldn't be like this. To anyone else I have everything. I have no problems getting up to try and make it at life. I try so hard and manage to always get it wrong. I refuse to whine and make excuses. I feel like a punk ass bitch even writing this. I've never wanted to kill myself more than I have this past year. I mutter it to my self each night. I don't understand how I can love my daughter so much and hate myself so bad.

Im not one to feel sorry for myself but if I was an abortion, the world would have one less poser to fall in love with and be burdened and disappointed by."
1454,Feeling blue,I recently got on Reddit just to talk about how I’m feeling not sure if I’m doing it right lol. Anyways recently I have just been feeling very blue like noting has been going wrong or nothing horrible has happened but I feel like I am lost. I feel like I am disconnected from everything. I don’t have any emotions towards anything and I don’t have any motivation. Sometimes I think I’m depressed but I put it off because I feel like it’s not important or people just won’t understand and say your not depressed you act fine. I feel like my whole life I have put my feelings to the side and acted like I was okay and now everything is just catching up to me all the feelings that I have pushed away to the back of my brain are finally resurfacing.
1455,First Loneliness / Depressive Episode after 5 months of antidepressants (20M),"Hey all. Hope everyone's staying warm and fighting the good fight this December. 

For context- I started taking antidepressants (Prozac 20mg) this past summer, and for the last 5 months things had been looking somewhat better. Progress, at the least!

However, this past weekend I realized I've been in the throes of a pretty rough depressive episode, my first such episode ever since starting the medication. I'm not surprised per se, because life comes in ups and downs and it's my emotional reaction to finals and a stressful semester coming to a close (I'm a third-year undergrad student). 

But I've realized something- I'm hardly any closer to overcoming my soul-crushing loneliness than I was 5 months ago. For me, loneliness is the major focus of my depression. My most prevalent and hostile automatic thoughts revolve around the question: ""Am I going to feel this lonely for the rest of my life?"" Because I feel pretty suckishly lonely, and have been for the past 4 years. I don't have a ton of social anxiety per se... it's more that I float between states of either not feeling like I need to interact with people at all, or being horribly lonely and sad. I have friendly acquaintances/classmates and maybe a few people I hang out with once every two weeks or so, but no best friends or friend groups. Most of the time I do my own thing, and it's fine until all of the sudden the loneliness hits and being alone is suddenly an excruciating experience.

Being in college has helped a little by being able to surround myself constantly with people, enough to keep the loneliness somewhat at bay. But starting this semester I've been living off campus, and having a single in a 4bd apartment has been a double-edged sword. For all the luxuries of having my own space, lately I've felt more and more trapped and isolated.

People have recommended taking up a hobby or other creative outlets, but I'm currently a theatre major in college and so my career essentially IS my creative outlet. And while I've tried to solve the loneliness by throwing myself into working on my career, it's left me burnt out, socially isolated, and more depressed than I've been in months. When I keep busy, things feel fine, but it's during the slow moments when I start feeling lonely, trapped, and on the verge of despair.

At the end of this long ramble, I guess I'm trying to ask for help and support. It's something I've been working on this past year (reaching out for help when I need it, instead of trying to suck it up and push past the pain). So if any of you wonderful human beings have tips or advice for how I can make more of a concerted effort to include friends in my life, I'm all ears. ❤️"
1456,There’s no point,"Why should I not die? Everyone either hates me or is indifferent. My own parents fucking regret having me and always complain to me about how much of a financial burden it is to keep me alive. My friends don’t like me. I’m always the first one to go when push comes to shove. Half the time they just forget about me. Everyone forgets I exist. The amount of times I’ve been left off stupid class rosters made by a teacher or something because I don’t matter enough for someone to remember. I bring nothing good to anyone’s lives. Not once in my life have I done something to make someone like me. I bring down anyone who goes out of their way to acknowledge my existence, and I don’t even enjoy being here. I love my friends but I know deep down they don’t reciprocate my feelings so it hurts more than it helps. I feel like I just leech off everyone’s happiness. I don’t know why I’m still here. Imaging the rush of jumping of a bridge is the only thing that brings me temporary solace. I’m gonna crack soon. I know it. I hate tomorrows."
1457,Bad time of the year again..,"December has not been the best month for me since 2012 when my older brother passed away. It’s hard to believe he has almost been gone 7 years and the holidays are continuously a difficult time for me. It’s like once mid November hits I start to fall into that hole where I realize what time of the year is approaching and it all just hits me like a ton of bricks. I haven’t been doing too well lately either. I had a horrible, horrible breakdown last Friday night. I just could not help but cry and cry. It just makes me wonder if that hole, that piece of me that is pretty much gone ever since my brother passed away, will ever truly heal. Makes me wonder too if I will ever be able to enjoy the holidays one day. It’s almost like I go over board for everyone else over the holidays and put myself on the backburner because I just want everyone else to be happy and try to numb and block out that pain that I have. Who knows.. all I know is that it has been rough and I am truly just over this month."
1458,I drove between two semis on a slick highway to feel alive,"We are the middle children of history no gret war no great depression no real meaning. As it is said in fight club. I am a 23 year old male I have always pushed myself to extremes. Working near 24 hour shifts staying awake for days always fidning solice in the duality of life. I feel nothing or everything passionately. Lately I have felt like I have no real purpose. I'm a recent college dropout I struggled and decided it was not for me. I already have a degree I just can't find a job. I hustle and try and make money on the side with stock trading and whatever else I can. But I have no real purpose. I hate modern society there is no danger we are all force fed bullshit that we don't need to make ourselves feel a rush of dopamine. Everything is so safe and boring and we live with the human condition knowing we are going to die. Tonight on my way home after another unfified day at work I drove 75mph beside a semi with one very close in front of me on a wet rainy night where I could barely fucking see just so I could feel the sheer fucking rush and feel the danger and feel alive. I may have slid and died and it excited me I rolled down all the windows so the sound was deafing. I know this ain't healthy but its the first time I've not felt safe and protected and actually alive for a very long time.  


We have no real purpose or meaning but to live feel emotions and die."
1459,This is kind of bizarre but DAE feel like they should have died during their childhood?,"IDK it just makes more sense to me--maybe because I have constant super vivid memories from my childhood (specifically like from 2.5 to 8 years old). It's not like my childhood was super good or super bad, but I definitely was under so much anxiety and stress that it would literally make me have panic attacks, vomit frequently, and get IBS symptoms. But suppose it's a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils--having an anxious childhood and dying while you still have the innocent hope of a bright future or growing up to realize that being normal and well adjusted was never a part of your story to begin with. 

And even though I was always the most 'mature' and reserved kid back then, I still had the freedom to 'be a kid' if I wanted to--to be innocent, oblivious, childlike, carefree. I often get super vivid flashbacks of doing mundane shit like playing an old video game or going to an easter egg hunt or having my mom read to me or playing on the playground. It literally feels like I'm there still, like I'm just daydreaming recess sitting in first grade. And then right when I'm immersed into it and forget out my life now, I'll get something just like the Alfred Hitchcock vertigo effect in my visual field and the sinking in your heart when you go over a rollercoaster as I'm hit with the realization that I was only 6 years old when those memories happened and I'm 22 now. 

It just feels 'different' looking back. Very much in a dissociative/DPDR type way which makes me wonder if my stress as a child causing me to dissociate all the time before I even knew it was. I remember one morning I was sitting in the hallway in 2nd grade waiting to take a reading test or something but all I could focus on was the slightly distorted morning news broadcast from a radio down the hall. I just remember then it felt so un-fucking-real and I just thought how it felt like I was dreaming.  

Well anyways, ironically, I haven't really been depressed or suicidal lately. Just sort of solemnly reflective of a time of life that I yearn for but at the same feels like it wasn't even me."
1460,I really hate the holiday season.,"Every year, it's the same thing: parents fighting, sister telling me how lazy I am for not helping her scrub the house from top to bottom during my vacation, mother threatening to not do Christmas at all next year because father did something to ruin her Christmas spirit...and it just goes on and on. I try so hard to be in the spirit, but I've found in recent years that I just don't have any. The holidays suck."
1461,I give up,I give up trying to work in school. I go be up trying to be funny. Or cool. I go r up trying to get people to notice me. I give up. And I want to give up living.
1462,I'm tired of the self help bullshit,"I'm going to kill myself. I don't want to hear anymore reasons why not, I have no one and nothing to live for. No one will miss me when I'm gone. The only thing left is I need to know where to shoot myself for the easiest death possible. I can't find a definite result on Google due to all the suicide watch stuff"
1463,I’m losing my memory due to the severe suppression of past events in my life and I don’t know how to fix it.,"I woke up yesterday morning and was going about my day as usual, when out of nowhere a rather traumatic memory resurfaced without warning - I’ve unfortunately fallen into a rather depressive cloud because of it and as a result have also just been ruminating on it these past two days.

The only issue being, no matter how hard I try to pick at my brain and get a grasp on why or when this happened, I can’t come to any conclusions. Everything is so foggy. Only vague details come into play when I try to think. I don’t remember the name of the person who caused me pain, I don’t remember how old I was when this happened, I can’t even bring myself to remember where I was in my life and the events that took place around the time when this incident occurred. 

With this memory came a few others that I succeeded in squashing down and hiding away in some unresolved section of my brain and I’m finding that, not only am I unable to remember the names of most of the people in these past memories, but I’m unable to formulate a proper timeline of my life in general.

What can I do to fix these holes in my memory and solidify the past memories I’ve nearly obliterated from my mind?"
1465,I’m so full of hate,"I have so much hate inside of me and I feel like I cannot escape it. I hate my family and I especially hate my parents and I hate my house and I hate politics I hate humanity I’m just drowning in malice and it is miserable. I want to let go but I just can’t. everywhere i look i see things that make me hate even more 

how can i stop being a creature of hate? i hardly feel like i’m a person anymore"
1466,What's it like in the hospital,My girlfriend had to go today because she's not sure if she can keep her self safe. She's not replying to anything so I guess she's busy. Does anyone know what she'd probably be doing on the first day? I miss her and just wanna know how she's doing. Thank you all
1467,My anxiety and depression had gotten so much better..I've been home for the first time in 3 months and it's just as bad as it used to be,"I've been living in another country for university for one semester now and I've realized there's so many things that I'd been changing about myself to fit them. I truly had thought they were pretty chill for Christian parents but the longer I've been away from them the more I've realized that they were either lying about how they feel or I just couldn't see it. They're always judging me from the way I dress (a skirt any shorter then knee length is considered inappropriate, no tight clothing, no spaghetti straps, even tight jeans) the nose piercing I got almost immediately after leaving sent them through a whole loop when they found out. It's like there's a wall of things we are and then aren't allowed to talk about and it's terrible because I know they love me but I'm not sure it's unconditional or really there at all. They don't know about my tattoo and I'm scared what they're gonna do when they find out. (I might just bear the heat and wear long sleeves as long as I can). They also don't know I don't go to mass anymore and the more I step back from it I just don't know.. I still respect it but I don't feel the same.

I thought it was going to be fine but I've been here an hour and I've already gotten so many lectures and I've already had to lie about who I am to make them happy. I want to leave I hate this place. I wish I had supportive parents who would love me no matter what. I know this sounds so stupid but I just don't fit in at all here and I hate it because I know if I was honest they would hate me too. they won't stop treating me like I'm 14 even though I've living off my own money and been completely self sufficient for 3 months. Not to mention I don't think they like my boyfriend who is nothing but respectful and has really helped me become a better person... I don't know what to do. I just went from so excited for being home to hating everything in like 3 seconds. It's going to be the longest month and I wish I could just leave..."
1468,I need support.,"I (21F) am so incredibly depressed. It has come and gone in waves for years. Something embarrassing is enough to send me into a deep depression instantly. I have no self esteem or self image. My anxiety is debilitating and it makes me sad how used to it I am. I keep trying to pull myself up by the bootstraps and muster through it all, do things that make me feel good, but I don’t understand why I feel so awful. I hate certain things about my appearance. I have some qualities of my personality that I really love, and feel proud of, but my anxiety goes against all of my instincts and I say weird things and act weird because I am ultimately looking outward for validation. I have no security in myself. I feel terrified. This is so embarrassing, I just have no clue where to turn. 

I hate putting this out there and hate to feel like the victim, I just don’t understand why I feel so terrible out of the blue. There are usually causes or “triggers”... but they are quite small and my reaction to them and ability to cope with criticism or whatever it may be is completely unhealthy and unstable. I am so sad that my life is overtaken with this feeling."
1469,A therapist who can’t even figure out my own life,"I’ve been struggling with depression on and off my whole life. I’m working as a therapist and have made a difference in so many people’s lives. But I’m emotionally and mentally a train wreck. I constantly criticize myself, I have passive suicidal thoughts (no intent), and I can’t seem to feel “okay” for more than a few hours at a time. 
Being a therapist means that finding my own therapist is difficult at best. When I do, they’re using the same techniques I use every day. 
I don’t know how to snap out of this funk. Meds haven’t been helping, venting to friends doesn’t help... frankly I’m so tired of feeling like a burden to everyone."
1470,Does anyone experience rotating physical symptoms?,"I’ve been depressed for around a year now. It seems that every few weeks my physical symptoms will rotate. Sometimes I feel a hole in my chest, then a couple weeks goes by and I’ll she a massive head ache for weeks straight, then can’t get enough sleep, then insomnia for a month. No symptom seems to stay for that long but they are all pretty brutal. I’ve heard it could be your mind mapping out emotional issues on your body? Has anyone else experience something like this?

Also does anyone have any tips on sleeping? Haven’t slept for a couple weeks."
1471,It’s nice,"You know, life has gotten me a little down recently, but at least the school was handing out free donuts today :). I hope you guys were happy with your day too."
1472,I don't know how to find meaning,"        Everything I do has no meaning. I'm just fumbling my way through life. Doing nothing every day and not having anything to say about myself. I don't even have much of a personality. I just adapt to everyone unless I strongly disagree with them. My existence is meaningless and I don't mean anything to anyone. Most of the time I just observe people because I don't have anything relevant or interesting to say. 
        My depression went away for about 6 months and then came back. I felt so full of life for those 6 months, and now I have nothing. I haven't attended school in a month, and I feel horrible about that because I used to be such an overachiever. Now I'm failing all of my classes, which I also did last year because I didn't attend school enough to get credit. I feel as if I'm wasting my teenage years but there's nothing I can do about it and I'm just watching myself from behind a glass wall."
1473,Help,Pain is no fun make it stop. Please
1474,It’s 9 and I’m drunk,Fuck me ha I’m goinga regret this tomorrow. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucki
1475,Sometimes I just feel like I’m not good enough to keep up with how fast the world is moving,It really sucks and makes me feeling like everyone around me is swimming and I’m just barely keeping my nose above the water. I feel useless. Pathetic. Unimportant. Like I’m stupid. Im bound to disappoint myself and the ones around me. I feel like I’m bound for failure.
1476,Video games make me feel suicidal,"Now don't the wrong idea, Me sitting in a chair for hours upon isn't the reason i get depressed...but rather my performance in a video game. I grew up playing competitive games like WWE, Celebrity Deathmath and stuff like back when me and my brothers got and OG Xbox for Christmas in 2005...(i was born in 2003) so i was really impressionable. I've always been competitive wasn't having fun unless i was winning....but now it's different. I get really when i play like complete trash to the point where i harm myself by slamming like hand on a desk, wall etc. I don't see video games as a way of entertainment anymore, I can't stop seeing it as a way to prove yourself...i feel like people respect me less and less the worse i play...every single game i play, I'm the worse one...Smash, mk11, mario kart, fortnite, and RB6S are all games I play actively play and in all of them, im the one who gets taken lightly...when i play so bad in a game or get bodied...i honestly think to myself ""you're so bad"" ""why are you even playing?"" ""If you're so bad at something you evoke so much time, why do you even exist?"" I get so depressed i actually considered suicide multiple times...i hate the feeling of uselessness when im in last place in a game it makes me feel like trash inside...like im not good enough...I doubt anyone feels the same way as me but if you do, please respond...i'd like to see your POV.

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this junk...(as you can probably tell I'm not a very confident person but thank you)"
1477,I am lost,"I do not know where to go from here. I don't even feel like I can be seen in front of my family anymore, and my social life has been completely destroyed. I have hit rock bottom, but I cannot go up. I have lost everything, and I have nothing to gain."
1478,i’m no longer funny,"my bsf came over for a sleepover and normally, we’d always be dying laughing and making jokes. but this past time was so... temperate. and i feel so bad about wasting her time when she could have been with someone else laughing. sigh. i felt tired the entire time she was here. i didn’t want her over as soon as she walked in. and i knew i was boring her but. yeah."
1479,Wanted to finally share something,"Hi,

I don’t have anything left to do really that can help me right now so I finally am getting the nerve to anonymously write my feelings for any anonymous people which want to read them and I thought this would be a good place to share. I don’t have any experience with this I’ve always been the suffer in silence type I don’t share when I’m sad I always hide it until it goes away as I believe I can get over my problems much easier when it’s just me solving it.

I was always a pretty friendly person, just getting through life and having some close friends, nothing really too drastic, until one summer I decided I wanted to be more outgoing and energetic like I was with my family, just all the time. So I changed, and doing so made me so much happier. From then on I was always the most outgoing and crazy person around, I was happy with everyone and everyone loved hanging out with me and I loved it, I felt like I was my true self, it’s what made me happy. I had this neighborhood group of friends which I loved more than anything else in the world. We all lived basically right next to eachother and I spent almost every second of my free time outside hanging out with them, growing up with them, getting into trouble with them, finding ourselves together. I was always the one outside with whoever could be with me, I was always that kid who loved being with people and hanging out. They really made me who I am today.

After 6 years of this my family got up and moved us from the United States to Germany. I was a fucking idiot when they brought up the move for the very first time because I got excited and was all for it. I had no idea what the fuck I was really getting myself into, I was only like 13. I didn’t realize the consequences. So yea, we moved. To the middle of nowhere in a village with farm lands and fertilizer tractors riding around stinking up the whole place every Thursday. When someone talks about being in buttfuck nowhere they have never been to this fucking village. There was nobody there, except an old ass senior home with old people everywhere. Nonetheless my dumbass was still optimistic that I was gonna “make new friends here” and it would be exactly like my neighborhood back in the US just with... german kids.. But no, there were no german kids. There weren’t any kids for that matter, I was all alone. 

There was an international school about 1h30m train ride away from my house where I’d be with people like me and everything would be in English. There was also a German school 15 minutes away which I could go to. So here comes mistake of a lifetime #2, I chose the German school. Worst fucking year of my entire life. Don’t get me wrong I was still outgoing as shit I got along with everybody. But no matter how well you can get along with people throwing shit around acting like hooligans and kicking soccer balls at each others asses, there is no fucking connection, with anyone, when you can’t sit down and have a real ass conversation with them. So here’s where my depression truly started. I was lonely. Life felt like literal hell, I had no connection with anyone I was utterly miserable. The kids thought they were my friends but they had no idea how I was truly feeling under all of the stupid games we would play, and hey, I couldn’t tell them, I was just the crazy american who laughed with them and was surprisingly good at soccer. Like I said, I couldn’t speak their language, they spoke broken English but much too broken for me to open up about my feelings to them. It just wouldn’t make sense. So I struggled through that year every way possible counting down the days and missing about half of the second semester of school due to me being “sick” which was basically just me laying in my bed so depressed I couldn’t get up. See I wasn’t actually a student at that school. I was what they called a “Gastschüler”. Which is basically a guest that joins along in the classes to learn German from everyone and see if they would wanna continue their high school years at the school. Eventually that horrible year ended, and I decided to finally go to the international school despite having to take an 1h30m train ride every morning.

I kinda fit right in at the international school, I made a group of friends who seemed cool, we had all the same interests... relatively. Shitty thing was this school was literally made for geniuses and I was a fucking dumbass so I failed basically everything and felt stupid all the time. Anyways, my “friends” which I finally got after so long, decided to start making group chats without me and hanging out without me even though I was apart of their group so yea they were fucking dickheads and it took me the whole first year at that school to figure out what they were doing. Second year my family actually moved to the same city as my school which was really awesome because I was a 6 minute bike ride away instead of an 1h30 train ride. Problem was, I had no friends again. But I couldn’t just have no friends. So I kept hanging out with those dickheads and I pretended to not notice that they would hangout without me and try and hide their stupid fucking group chats from me even tho it was obvious as fuck. Then everything changed.

I met a girl. She was really amazing and we got along super well. I was always a boys kinda guy I never really had friends which were girls but this girl was different. She was so cool and I just clicked with her more than I had with anyone else before. Let’s just call her Lucy. So Lucy and I eventually started dating and I didn’t have to hangout with those dickheads anymore because I had my new bestfriend Lucy. About 2 months into the relationship she decided she wasn’t happy and wanted to go on a break. I really didn’t want to lose her so I tried to start fixing myself to cater to how she felt so that she would like me again. Which when I look back on it fucked me up a lot mentally. While we were on this break we agreed to not do anything with anyone else and that we would stay loyal. Then she cheated on me and after I found out she told me that she just had a “vibe” with this person and that she wanted to see where things would lead with him. I was heartbroken. But obviously not heartbroken enough because 2 weeks later she decided to not pursue her vibe with this one dude and I got back together with her. Like I said, I didn’t have anyone else. We proceeded to date for another year and 5 months. About 5 months in she started acting all batshit crazy and I swear to god she was a fucking psychopath. She always wanted to fight she always was mad at me no matter what I did, I’d spend hours trying to calm her down and make her happy again just for her to flip her shit again within five minutes. But she “loved me so much”. And it felt so good to have someone love me. So I told her I loved her back. I feel really bad about this. Honestly, I don’t really know how I felt. I wanted to love her so bad, I just didn’t really feel it. I hated myself for not feeling it but it just wouldn’t come. But I couldn’t leave her. First of all I had no one else, and I was such a fucking pussy I was so goddamn scared to do it I let this shitty ass miserable relationship go on for so long and it was such a mistake. See being with her made me feel trapped because I wanted to get away from the situation but I couldn’t. 

This gave me crippling anxiety. It started out as a fear of throwing up in front of everyone and whenever I was “trapped” in a room I would feel like I was going to throw up. Eventually it got worse and turned from the fear of throwing up when I was trapped, to a fear of having a heart attack. Which doesn’t go well with anxiety because anxiety attacks feel like heart attacks and I had anxiety about having a heart attack, so yea. I couldn’t go anywhere where I would feel trapped. I would lose my shit in the movie theatre, I couldn’t concentrate a single second in school, I felt trapped everywhere I went. The one place I always felt safe before... my room. It didn’t even feel safe anymore, nothing could protect me from a heart attack. So for weeks straight I swear my heart would not stop pounding, the only time it wasn’t was when I was asleep because I couldn’t think about having a heart attack but the second I woke up it was the first think on my mind and my heart would begin pounding again. It would get hard to breathe, it would become hard to eat and to drink, but I never told anyone. I don’t know why, it was hard to think straight. So finally I simply could not take it anymore and I broke up with Lucy after we graduated. I broke her heart, and I didn’t feel a thing. I finally ripped off the bandaid and I couldn’t even cry. I wasn’t able to. I lost the ability to cry at some point throughout my whole journey in Germany. I still can’t. Every once in a while I’ll explode for a few hours but that’s like once every six months. I wish I could always cry, it feels so good, but I can’t. Anyways she hates me now but we moved on and that was the end of that whole thing. I still hate all those dickheads I hung out with before Lucy. I want to move on but they are just such shit people I never met such shit people. I try though.

Anyways, remember my friends from the US. Yea I sort of kept in contact with them after I moved but honestly, I wish I hadn’t. The hardest thing in the world is seeing them on social media still growing up together while I’m here alone miserable as fuck when this is not the life I was supposed to fucking live. I don’t even know who they are anymore and they don’t fucking care to ever talk to me. They would never ask me how I am or anything they just fucking moved on. No one would talk to me unless I would reach out to them. They assume just like everyone else I’ve ever talked to that I am fine because I always act super happy and outgoing around people but once I am alone I couldn’t be sadder, because I have no real friends to talk to. I know they still love me, cause they tell me. But I know they eventually stopped caring about me after I was gone. It hurts so bad. I hate seeing them together without me. I was always there. Now it’s too late they’re all going off to college and done being kids. I just wish we could be kids forever.

So here I am today. I have absolutely no one in my life except for my family who I love so very much but they are just so fucking annoying. I hate myself so much that I can’t stand them because they try to help me but it pisses me the fuck off. I don’t want their help they can’t do anything for me they just want to “talk” and cry with me. I need a peer. My best friend of all time, my brother who is 9 years younger than me, was my rock throughout everything, but I mean, how happy can I be hanging out with an 8 year old all day. It hurts so bad to turn him down because he looks up to me so much but I don’t want to play legos all day, I want to be alone and he always asks me why I’m so sad and I just have to make up some fucking excuse and turn him away at my door while he cries because I won’t hangout with him and he is lonely too because he goes to a German school and has no friends and he’s like the only person I actually care about so I fucking die inside when I see him sad but I just can’t bring myself to hangout with him because I need to be alone. Surprisingly this is what hurts me the most, out of everything

Ever since the German school I had considered just killing myself but I have never actually thought about it as a real option because it is waaaayyy too fucking scary. I wrote a suicide note at one point but that was just me being stupid. I could never bring myself to do it. There is another reason why I can’t do it. Throughout all of this, throughout all of the misery and life experiences that have fucked me up. When I am not siting in my room depressed as fuck all day. Those rare occasions when I actually am in a relatively good mood or I visit family somewhere and get to actually associate with people. I am still, the most, outgoing, crazy, energetic, friendly, funny and loving person. So therefore I have a dream. I have this fucking terrifying dream in life. Which I want more than anything to achieve. So I live on, because for some fucking reason, I have this feeling in my heart, that I am going to achieve it. I feel like I know that I am going to do it, despite it being 1 million times bigger than the person I am. So I work hard, to achieve this dream, even though it gets so insanely hard to stay positive sometimes, because it seems like all odds are against me and nobody wants to help me out. Still, I work harder on this than I have ever worked on anything before. Because the idea of working some random desk job is the scariest thing I could ever think of and I will stop at nothing to steer clear of an occupation of the sort. That is my greatest fear: failure. 

I am not going to tell you my dream, I am sorry. I just want you to know that once I move back to the US, (because that has been my goal since moving here because I hate Germany with all of my might I am sorry but I hate it so much) I am going to be happy again. Ever since I came here I have yearned to be in the US. My birthplace, where I grew up ... my home. I have been away for too long. So, I look forward to this, as well as working towards my dream once I get there, and that is what keeps me going. And I will keep going. It’s just right now, at this point, I am stuck here in Germany living with my parents because if I stay just 6 more months I will have permanent residency in Europe which my parents basically are forcing me to stay here and get so that’s why I can’t just leave in case you were wondering. It feels just like when I was counting down towards the end of my year of hell at the German school. Which I thought for sure I would never have to experience something that terrible ever again and here I am. The worst thing is I have no idea if this will be the last time I experience one of these hells. My life is probably filled with them. But I have to get through this, otherwise I will never know if I will achieve my life long dream or not. Plus if I don’t I can always just off myself then. I feel like it will be mush less scary at that point. But I have a feeling even if I don’t achieve my dream I will achieve something else along the way. Perhaps something that I didn’t necessarily want, but the one thing that I always needed, I just never knew.

I wanted to write this because I was feeling insanely depressed and I have really been needing someone to talk to lately. I just haven’t had anyone for quite some time. If you actually read all of this I really appreciate you. Thank you for listening. &lt;3"
1480,I can never get the words out,everything in my head is unexplainable and it makes me feel worse because how can i get better if i can’t explain how i feel?
1481,My dad died on Christmas when I was 13. Three years ago in a few weeks.,Can we all agree that the holidays fucking suck?
1482,Just got blocked,"I managed to get blocked by the only person that I truly felt I have, because I'm an idiot. 

I mean, I still have one friend and my family, but I feel like they're so distant from me, that I don't feel I ""have"" them, you know? My family doesn't even know that I'm depressed.

I get blocked like two days ago, and I feel completely lonely now. Things were already so difficult, and now I just screw up and made everything worse.

I think even if I get unblocked, I will just isolate myself and that's it. I'm feeling like a piece of shit right now, and don't want to hurt anyone else. I don't deserve to have anyone else."
1484,I think I might have dysthymia and I don't know what to do,"I'm 15M and I've been suspicious for a few months now that I might have depression. I've posted here before because I self diagnosed myself and I got replies that I need to see my doctor. The problem is that my next doctors appointment is in 8 months but I can't wait that long.

I get sad about my social life, ruminate a lot, have low self esteem, eat a lot, get angry a lot, have bad focus in school, feel unmotivated. I feel stuck because when I get bad grades due to my bad focus and motivation I start getting more sad and it repeats like a loop. 

I try to not show my sadness at school because I don't want people laughing at me or thinking I'm weird but it takes a toll on me and I just keep the sadness for another time.  Sometimes I cant handle it and it overtakes me to the point where I can't control it.

What can I do? I don't think I can wait that long."
1485,Idk if I'm depressed or not by lifes been ass for the past year,"For a while now all I do is listen to music at school , sometimes music dont even be playing I just dont want people to talk to me. But I do want friends. But I also wanna be alone. Dont even get me started about home. It's like I dont even know anybody inside my house anymore. They're all so distant. I dont even text people first anymore, and because of that I realize I dont get hit ups either..."
1486,I used to have some form of triumphant sorrow when I was younger..not anymore.,"My sadness was bittersweet, I glorified it and not because I was faking it, but because it was all I've known, it was weirdly comforting. It's hard to explain why I romanticised it even though I hated it back in the day. But I had this sensation of being on top of the world, Alone living in solitude, Had a stupid gothic phase etc.

Now, My pain is too great, too great and there is nothing triumphant about it, nothing to give me strength, I'm a grown man now, and it's all too real, the romanticism has gone, it's only pure pain. It hurts to breath or live, I don't want this pain. There is nothing to to be ""oh look at me I'm a dark goth living in a misty haunted forest"" kind of shit. It's real pain and I want it to end."
1487,Urges during depression,I've had depression for years now and occasionally I'll get urges to try different drugs and drink. Is this normal. I don't act on the impulse but the desire is there

I wrote and recorded this song today. I just wanted to share this here. I hope whoever hears this enjoys it as much as I did writing it. I just need this therapy session.

Lyrics:

Sometimes i wish i could go back to 17 /

A drop out but I had so many dreams /

Now i'm jaded getting faded from this empty bottle /

I try to sip it all until I feel the wobble /

Like Han said in toyko drift it was facts /

You makes choices you don't look back /

Getting wiser but the pain wouldn't go away /

Always got in the way with all the progress made /

I won't want your pity I just wanna make it right /

Stuck in a city where I don't even have a life /

My tears were like my phone they were always dry /

Staring at my self I don't know how to say goodbye /

In a playground filled with people and you in the background /

Waiting for your turn now it's dark no one is around

Picking up the pieces from the ground /

I just wanna pack up my bags and just leave this town /

If things don't change then I know I'll be fucked /

Surprised i'm not od on drugs laying slumped /

My mom said I'm not her son anymore can't take it back /

Sorry that I couldn't be the child you never had /

It was time to leave, overstayed at 25 /

18 I was legal you should've fucking kicked me out /

Probably would've been fine not let everything bottle up /

Now we'll probably never talk again /

I don't talk to the only person I related too /

Faked on hanging out then went m.i.a just out the blue /

Convinced myself that something happened because I care /

But maybe it was that but partly my ego too /

Either way now it's back to talking to myself to vent /

Was over thinking on this 400 dollar rent /

Was trying to save but this job went by tips /

But I got anxiety so bad that I quit /

Sometimes I wish I could go back to 17 /

A drop out but I had so many dreams /

Now i'm jaded getting faded from this empty bottle /

I try to sip it all (x2) until I feel the wobble /"
1489,"Hey dudes! My depression has been hitting me hard lately, I feel like I’ve been hit by a train.","      I’m exhausted, I’m tired of everyday things. I’m too tired to do my schoolwork, too tired to talk to my family. Although I am exhausted I haven’t been able to sleep throughout the night in years. I’m restless no matter my state of consciousness. I can’t concentrate in class. I have friends but I don’t have my own person and at the current moment I feel as though everyone around me has that special person. I don’t feel as though I can connect with people anymore. I’m going on dates, talking to people, but I don’t feel like any of it’s real. I feel as though I’m not myself. I feel alienated in my own body. I hate by body and I’ve used sex to try to boost my self-confidence. Shocker that it doesn’t work for long. I’ve tried pretending, pushing my feelings away. I can’t do it anymore. I’m tired of pretending I’m alright, that I’m not exhausted, that I’m happy. I just want to be content. Does anyone else feel the same?"
1490,Why do I feel like this...,"I have always had a good life. My parents love me, my family cares about me, i have had a few close friends. I go to college, I have a job, yet I still feel a ridiculous amount of pain. I constantly feel alone, even when in a room of people, and it just hurts so badly. My parents shower me with love, but I still feel like nobody really likes me, and feel like its not real. I had a bestfriend who tried to help me with my problems but no matter how much I wanted it to be enough it never was and I still continued to hurt. I feel like such a terrible person constantly for this. Theres so many people with worst lives, but I still feel terribly hurt, and down constantly. I wish i could feel better and make those around me who cant help me feel like they did something. Why do I feel like such a big peice of me is not there, I feel useless, and worth significantly less than everyone else. I go to the therapist, and he tells me things and its just like words coming out of his mouth but none of them mean anything to me. Especially since its someone getting paid to tell me nice things. It doesnt help at all. I started taking antidepressents and they dont seem to be working. I still feel so much pain, and it feels like the only way out is to die, but i dont want to die... Ill have some short bursts of hapiness, maybe for an hour or so a day and itll just go right back into shit. I cant handle the pain... Whats next for me, what do i do..."
1491,Does anyone else feel like their pet/s are the only thing keeping them from being suicidal?,"I don’t have many strong relationships or attachments to things. In the past at this point I definitely would’ve been contemplating things but ever since I got a pet I can’t find myself even imagining it without a pang in my gut at the thought of leaving my fur baby all alone. I honestly would be in such a worse place without him.

Not that I’m advocating anyone get pets to try and fix themselves, please be in a secure place both home and finance wise before adoption! It’s a decades long commitment! 

But still, my pet is my reason for a lot of stuff. Can’t die cause he’ll be alone. Can’t skip work cause I need to pay for his care. Can’t stay in bed all day cause he needs exercise, etc. I can shirk all my other responsibilities but this is one I absolutely will not."
1492,"Advice from depressed individuals in a relationship, or individuals in a relationship with a depressed person","Basically I love my girlfriend and I believe she loves me. However I know I’m a burden to her not physically and emotionally. I currently can’t provide for myself and won’t be able to for a month or two (physical) and am am struggling with a raging bout of dysthymia (emotional). I’ve been struggling with it for almost a decade, or at least that was when I was diagnosed, but I’ve hidden it quite well I think. 

In any event, I want to know if I should go through with my plan and break up with her before it becomes an issue and starts to drag her down. She deserves the best and I’m unable to provide that. The short term sting of an unexpected break up from a healthy and loving relationship might hurt her, but not nearly as much as supporting someone like me. I can’t ask her to do that. 

I guess I’m just hoping for validation that this course of action is the right one. It’s hard to say goodbye but harder to continue to burden her"
1493,I lack so much motivation I even find it hard to move.,"Like when I'm home alone and sit down I sometimes sit there for hours browsing my phone even when I know there are other things I want to do. It's really hard for me to get out of bed or find motivation for my hobbies.
I mean I still do the things I'm supposed to like going to work but I can't continue my life like this."
1494,This is ridiculous,"The only reason there is no help for me or any of us is because our society wants it this way. There is plenty to be done about our crisis, but they don't want to do it. Since there is no profit in helping people who don't have lots of money, they refuse to help. Or worse, they create county clinics and the like to appear as if they care, but these places are quagmires that are actually there for P.R. purposes, not to actually help anyone. Therefore, there is no hope of any help so why bother existing? The final insult is the fact that it is illegal to attempt to take the ultimate control of your own life. If you succeed, there isn't much to be done about it, but if you fail, your life will be even more ruined due to criminal charges being stuck to you. The logic of this is insane, but so is out modern society . (At least the one here in the US is). I am getting to the point where I am liking the whole 'suicide by cop' concept as it would bypass this stupid survival instinct that keeps messing things up. With today's law enforcement being little more than another hired army, and with the whole 'I felt my life was in danger' excuse for them to shoot people, I am betting I could pull it off with little effort. Regardless, the whole thing is ridiculous because people **could** make things better. The fact that they don't tells me all I need to know..."
1495,Sometimes dying is the only option,"What's the point when no one understands you, why you behave a certain way and why you desire certain things in life. People just always judge you, people get scared when you're ""too nice"". Like how else do you build rapport and a relationship with someone. They eventually ghost you and all the effort goes down the drain. Other people cry about being lonely but then they also don't want anything to do with you either. This cycle perpetuates and I honestly just don't feel like trying anymore. No one wants to be my friend or show me any love. No matter how nice I am, I'm always the last person everyone thinks about it. I don't really enjoy anything anymore either, what was once fun has turned into a chore. I'm only doing things to distract my mind and even that isn't helping anymore."
1496,"I feel like I'm drowning again, what do you guys do when this happen?","Since it has happened many times in the past, I can recognize when I'm getting really depressed again, and I can feel it happening now, I'm with a therapist already, it is just getting harder to keep myself afloat.

Honestly nowadays it just like the same old monster came back for another round, and even if I keep myself alive after the battle I have to heal and hope that next time it isn't so rough on me."
1497,I always feel like it's too late.,"I'm a 31-year-old guy who lives with his mom (who I happen to get along great with,) and a job that almost never gives shifts, so it might as well not even exist.  I help out around the house every day, and I helped my mom when she got cancer last year, (it's removed completely, thankfully,) and continue to help her to this day.  I know that I need to find a new job, which I'm working on, but I still feel like such a wastrel.

I have severe depression and anxiety problems.  I'm currently on four different medications.  I lost my job in July of 2017 because I missed too much work.  A job that I had since graduating High School, so 10 years.  A job that I actually kind of liked.  Now, as I said, I have a shitty job that never schedules me.

I'm currently single.  My serious girlfriend, who had been with me about six years off-and-on, left me sometime around there.  Before 2007, in 2006, I had a suicide attempt.  This led to me being put on meds, which helped, but it didn't prevent me from losing my job the next year.

My dream is to be a stand-up comedian.  I did stand-up for about a year before my suicide attempt.  I want to get back into it, but I'm so old.  Way too old to be starting something new.  I've come to the realization that my entire life will be wasted, and I'll never be what I want.

Sorry, I just wanted to type that out here."
1498,What has made life worth living for you?,I am a 28 year old female and the older I get the less I feel like I have to live for. I have family and friends but with the way relationships fade the bonds aren’t as strong anymore. I’m still able to make new friends but no friendship seems as strong as the ones I made in my late teens/early twenties. The older I get the more stress life brings. I get that this is normal but it makes it difficult to see the good. So please tell me some good things that happen as you age that makes it worth getting older.
1500,Benefits of social media vs negatives (widespread growing depression epidemic),"I think social media is causing a depression epidemic and people are skirting around it saying there’s some vague relationship.

I say Facebook is no better than the companies who got everyone hooked on OxyContin. Zero difference.

Facebook/Instagram has torn apart society in more negative ways than positive. It’s hurt more individuals than it’s helped."
1501,Floating deeper into the darkness.,"I feel like I’m floating in this darkness, pitch black nothingness, a void. Just alone, out there with nothing to grab ahold of, reaching out to no one and nothing. I’m just screaming and nothing escapes. I’m stuck. I’m alone. I’ve stopped fighting against it and reaching for any warmth bc it’s not there.  I’m completely alone in this.  

I can’t see the future and the past has become static and hard to remember."
1502,so fucking tired,"i'm tired of being shit at literally everything i do. tired of nobody loving me. tired of having no fucking privacy. tired of being ugly, and unfunny, having no talent, being annoying, being stupid. i'm tired of being alive. this shit sucks. i can't imagine doing this for one more year, let alone close to 60. fuck that. this will never get better, everything is shit and will stay shit. i should just kill myself and get it over with. everyone who tells me i have stuff to live for need to get the fuck over themselves. you're not me. you have no fucking clue how much this sucks, and you're fucking selfish for wanting me to suffer even longer just so you're not sad for a while. fuck you. i want to do the only good thing in my life-- ending it."

i used to be on meds and see a therapist. i think it was going well, i don’t know why i stopped. i’m 19 now and doing worse than i feel like i ever have. my mom is highly recommending that i go back on meds because clearly going to college and staying sociable isn’t enough to cure depression. 

the thing is, i’ve been only recently coming to terms with my eating disorder. i don’t know what it is but i realize i have one haha. if i go on an antidepressant i am terrified of gaining weight. i literally can’t. i won’t."

1505,Why the fuck has society failed to realize that depression starts in the body &amp; brain?,"I have had insanely bad depression and anxiety for most my life but finally realized in the last 3 years that it's mainly caused by mineral/vitamin deficiencies and the medical industry won't tell you that because of all the money made off of fucking medications. Magnesium deficiency alone is detrimental and an estimated 50% of the population has it and most of you could have it causing a lot of your problems. I have done hours of key research on the real causes of mental illness and there are five main biotypes that someone named William Walsh discovered. He tested and had labs and results of over 30,000 people with mental illness and there were the same 5 causes throughout everyone tested. I know how to get better now but I hate myself for not realizing the obvious before and the saddest thing is most of society is just as unaware and lost as I was before I saw the information I know now. I failed myself and the world failed me as well but I can't stress as much about them because I can only control what I think and do. I'm just so disappointed. The pharmaceutical industry is fucking people over and lying to them to make money off their illness and people unaware of it."

The world around me scares me. Memories, old and recent, freak me out. I feel like I’m stuck in a body that is not mine the worst part is that I feel like I’ll never feel normal again. I saw my psychiatrist last Monday and he put me on 10 mg of Lexapro daily. I hope it helps. I’m posting here because I’m scared and I’m looking for any hope that I will make it through this and feel sane again."
1510,Life long depression and I cannot see a way clear.,"  

Depression

I am depressed. Every day I wake up and within minutes the mind monster has me with its hatred. I say its hatred, but really the hatred is all mine. I hate myself. At least that is what I tell myself over and over again every day. I try to escape with sleep. I also do positivity meditations, whilst functionally useless, they distract me from the hateful pressure in my own skull. I want to make a hole in my head to let the pressure out. I like that someone else tells me I am ok, because I struggle so hard to tell myself that. I recognised a few years ago that I do not think positively at all. I am full of self-criticism and loathing. So I figured if I cannot give myself positive thoughts then maybe I can listen to some and it will take root and perhaps grow thought patterns that are helpful and compassionate to myself. This has not been the case. I have listened to these saccharine statements for years and there is no improvement. Everyday I wake to the barrage of self-hatred. And the odd thing is I have never done anything that logically deserves self-loathing. I have always tried to help others, I dedicated my younger life to helping kids at risk, I volunteered to help others, have volunteered at an orphanage for kids with special needs, have been there for friends going through difficult times and given food, support and comfort to friends and family. I have done everything I can to prove to the hatred in my head that I am not a bad person. To be clear I have never murdered anyone, raped or abused anyone – although I have been subjected to abuse and abandonment as a child and was raped as a young adult. Sometimes I wish some one would just kill me; it would save me from having to do it. 

I have spent years and years in therapy. From the age of 19 I sought therapy after realising that beating myself daily with a thick leather belt was not overly caring of myself – although I had framed the self-abuse as ‘motivation’. I told someone what I did and their horror at my casual abuse of myself was shocking to me. I really didn’t get it at all until I saw it in someone else’s eyes. I then started therapy and self-help courses for years and none of it has worked. None. I despise myself as much as I did back then if not more so because now I have an entire adulthood of struggling with these issues and failing to resolve them. 

For nearly thirty years I have struggled with this poisonous self-hatred and I have got nowhere. In fact, it has only worsened. I am 46 years old now and cannot find work. I feel like I am utterly useless. Every morning I wake up after too little sleep to only have a barrage of recrimination descend on me within moments of opening my eyes and ALL I WANT TO DO IS GO BACK TO SLEEP AGAIN, PREFERABLY PERMANANTLY. 

I send out my resume and am lucky to get a rejection. Mostly I am ignored. It has been a couple years now since I held down a proper job. A friend got me a contract, a few months ago and I delivered it, it was a huge project, which really should have gone to a content creation team to complete, I got it done, but the stress was unbelievable. I woke two or three times a night in a cold sweat, but I worked my arse off, got a couple aspects of the project done by contractors and delivered on time. Once it was done, I collapsed, utterly exhausted. I have been pretty much useless since then. 

The only reason I have not opened that hole in my head to let out the pressure is my girl. She is literally the best thing that has happened to me in my life. I could not subject her to the fallout of my suicide. Maybe all that therapy made enough space for her to show up in my life. 

I know I shouldn’t feel this way, I shouldn’t hate myself so much, but I do, and I don’t think it will ever change. I spent my whole life so far trying to stem the tide of self-hatred, but I can’t hold back the ocean with my bare hands."
1511,"Hello Reddit, I can help someone out there with their passion in life/work/hobbies.","My writing is not that great, so bare with me.

Around the age of 20 I did not know what I wanted to do for a career (As most 20 year olds are). I flunked out of high school so right there I thought I was already on the wrong track. However, I have tried so many different jobs as the years went on. I went from an office typing hundreds of entry's a day, working as a Cook at a Hotel&amp;Restaurant to working with sheet metal in a construction like setting. I needed help finding out what I wanted to do for a career. So, I turned to Job Corps. I learned how to make delicious food and landed a Hotel Cook job in Las Vegas after my time at Job Corps. The first year working I thought to myself. ""I found out what I wanted for a career. This is tolerable, I can do this."" However, I was still feeling missing something. I could never figure out what it was. Every day I felt like I was wasting my time and energy into what ever I was doing. Everything that I tried I felt like it didn't matter because my life was still empty with or without a career. I moved from Las Vegas to Oregon to be with my family because I didn't know what else to do for me to feel happier. I was happy for about 1-2 months and it went back to 'normal' again. What I mean by 'normal' is me feeling depressed and useless. You might think I'm exaggerating but I really am not. Every day I would worry about money and my life. So, I would fix the money problem with getting a crappy job. Then after about 2 weeks I would feel even worse than I did without money. So, I didn't know what was happening. I quit many jobs like that. Which turned into dwindling my family's financial because I didn't pay rent and I didn't want to work. Hell I didn't even want to live this life. Sometimes during the drive to work I thought about driving straight into a tree. This is no joke and I don't mean to be like that, but it's the truth. I asked myself this and this goes to a lot of aspects in life. ""Who would do anything if you or the people around you had a worse outcome?"" So, I knew I would never actually drive straight into a tree hoping to end my life. I would hurt many people who cared for me. 

I always wondered how people can work a crappy job and feel okay with it and tolerate it. I always thought ""Is this how life feels and people just deal with it?"" ""Am I just different or am I just extremely lazy to a point of depression?"" This took years to figure out why people can work a crappy job and be okay with it. I believe that they are able to work that crappy job because they are passionate about something in their life. I thought that was the case because I found out that I lack passion for anything that was going on in my life. That is when I realized the reason why I get so depressed working a crappy job, because my life was already crappy from no passion.. then I went and smacked it in the face with a 30-40 hour tiring work week. I lacked passion about absolutely anything in my life. So, it was hard to get out of bed in the morning. I even had no drive to play my favorite video games because I thought it was pointless and a waste of time. I still played them, but I never really let myself enjoy them. That is when I realized that I need to find something that I am passionate about and make that my main goal in life. To always have passion about something. I took some time to think. I really thought about it.. I thought about all my experiences. What I liked and what I didn't like about them. I finally figured out what I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping people with a life problem. Whenever I can help someone with a really important problem. I just feel like something is lifted. I never thought to notice it before. I have always helped people all throughout my life. I helped my friends with their life problems instead of helping mine most times. I like it when I can make someone else's problem go away. It makes me happier knowing that they don't have to deal with that huge problem that they felt they needed my help on. 

That is why I want to help people find out what they are passionate about. I want to really dig deep into people's experiences like I did with mine and figure out what you enjoyed and did not enjoy about each aspect of your life/work/friends in order to find passion somewhere. I want to figure out what you're passionate about so that you can live a happier life and in return.. help me live a happier life. I believe finding out what your passionate about is what makes you truly feel happiness. With passion you don't care about what happens during the day. Because, you get to go home and really deeply enjoy this one thing that you love. Whether it be work or a hobby. Everyone can be passionate about something. 

I'm 27 years old now turning 28 late next year. If you have a similar problem and want help finding out what you're passionate about. Message me on Reddit or leave a comment down below and I'll message you. Like I said I have helped many of my friends with their problems and I would like to help anyone else that I can. This is what I am passionate about, so help me.. help you."
1512,my boyfriend is pushing me away because of my depression,"he completely gave up in helping me in any way, only because his ""support"" that lasted for a few days hasn't insta-healed me and i weren't bursting with energy  
recently he said, that he had lost all of his feelings towards me, cause he described my behavior over the past few months as ""bad and unjustified""  
y'know what i was doing that whole time? i was just simply being depressed and even though still caring about him

1513,Did you any of you guys have any regrets after high school?,I’m dealing with a lot mentally I have some academic opportunities that came up but I’m not sure if I want to take them. I’m a senior in high school and so far the only thing that I’m regretting is not getting help sooner for my mental health.
1514,Any advice?,"To give you some context I’m 17 and Male. Lately I’ve been feeling really confused in life, I just feel like I’m endlessly going through it with no real goal. I know roughly what job/employment I want to get into and I think that I’ll be more than capable of achieving it but in order to get there I need to get through 2 years of college. Most of my friends went to different colleges and the friends that I do have in my college I barely see because of different timetables. I often find myself missing lessons and skipping days just because I don’t want to go. I’m on 68% attendance. My friends have picked up on the fact that I’m distant from them all and as a result I’m often excluded from motives on the weekend and other things. I don’t really have anything to live for. I come home from college and play video games for around 7/8 hours until I fall asleep. And I repeat the same process over and over again. I’m not too sure what I actually should do to fix any of this. I’m not even sure if this is the right subreddit but I guess I’m finally opening up. Has anyone been through this also and does and how did it work out for you"
1515,just want to be held,i dont want anything else. dont have anybody who could do that for me. just feel an empty pit inside of me and for some reason i think being held would make it a tiny bit better
1516,I just want a girlfriend man. Why is something that is so inate in human nature so hard to do?,
1517,Everyone just leaves,"I get so close and comfortable with people, and then they just leave. My heart can’t handle it anymore, I can’t live with the memories. 

I’m better off alone"
1518,I miss my childhood so much it's unbelievable,"Like up until age 10 or so I was truly happy and SO full of life and I had many friends. I miss it so fucking much I often start crying in bed when I'm trying to fall asleep. I just keep going through my childhood memories in my head and I just miss it so much even though my life isn't even that bad now. 

Plus I'm still only 18. But I've been feeling this incredibly strong need to be able to just go back to those days for a few years already. I'm so young but I feel like I've just been wasting my youth away for like 7 years... I just don't know how to be young anymore. When I see other teens hanging out and having fun I just feel so sad because I've never really gotten to be a part of something like that. I don't know if I ever will. I'm just so fucking lonely

Sorry if this is all over the place or repetitive it's 4am, I'm rreally tired and English isn't my first language. Thanks for reading ❤️"
1519,Wanted to finally share something,"Hi,

I don’t have anything left to do really that can help me right now so I finally am getting the nerve to anonymously write my feelings for any anonymous people which want to read them and I thought this would be a good place to share. Idk why I want to do this I guess I just wanna share something about me with someone cause I don’t get to do that much anymore. I don’t have any experience with this I’ve always been the suffer in silence type I don’t share when I’m sad I always hide it until it goes away as I believe I can get over my problems much easier when it’s just me solving it, instead of people trying to help me who could never know the whole story about me, giving me shitty ideas. No disrespect to them... it just doesn’t help.

I was always a pretty friendly person, just getting through life and having some close friends, nothing really too drastic, until one summer I decided I wanted to be more outgoing and energetic like I was with my family, just all the time. So I changed, and doing so made me so much happier. From then on I was always the most outgoing and crazy person around, I was happy with everyone and everyone loved hanging out with me and I loved it, I felt like I was my true self, it’s what made me happy. I had this neighborhood group of friends which I loved more than anything else in the world. We all lived basically right next to eachother and I spent almost every second of my free time outside hanging out with them, growing up with them, getting into trouble with them, finding ourselves together. I was always the one outside with whoever could be with me, I was always that kid who loved being with people and hanging out. They really made me who I am today.

After 6 years of this my family got up and moved us from the United States to Germany. I was a fucking idiot when they brought up the move for the very first time because I got excited and was all for it. I had no idea what the fuck I was really getting myself into, I was only like 13. I didn’t realize the consequences. So yea, we moved. To the middle of nowhere in a village with farm lands and fertilizer tractors riding around stinking up the whole place every Thursday. When someone talks about being in buttfuck nowhere they have never been to this fucking village. There was nobody there, except an old ass senior home with old people everywhere. Nonetheless my dumbass was still optimistic that I was gonna “make new friends here” and it would be exactly like my neighborhood back in the US just with... german kids.. But no, there were no german kids. There weren’t any kids for that matter, I was all alone. 

There was an international school about 1h30m train ride away from my house where I’d be with people like me and everything would be in English. There was also a German school 15 minutes away which I could go to. So here comes mistake of a lifetime #2, I chose the German school. Worst fucking year of my entire life. Don’t get me wrong I was still outgoing as shit I got along with everybody. But no matter how well you can get along with people throwing shit around acting like hooligans and kicking soccer balls at each others asses, there is no fucking connection, with anyone, when u can’t sit down and have a real ass conversation with them. So here’s where my depression truly started. I was lonely. Life felt like literal hell, I had no connection with anyone I was utterly miserable. The kids thought they were my friends but they had no idea how I was truly feeling under all of the stupid games we would play, and hey, I couldn’t tell them, I was just the crazy american who laughed with them and was surprisingly good at soccer. Like I said, I couldn’t speak their language, they spoke broken English but much too broken for me to open up about my feelings to them. It just wouldn’t make sense. So I struggled through that year every way possible counting down the days and missing about half of the second semester of school due to me being “sick” which was basically just me laying in my bed so depressed I couldn’t get up. See I wasn’t actually a student at that school. I was what they called a “Gastschüler”. Which is basically a guest that joins along in the classes to learn German from everyone and see if they would wanna continue their high school years at the school. Eventually that horrible year ended, and I decided to finally go to the international school despite having to take an 1h30m train ride every morning. I thought life was gonna get good again.

I kinda fit right in at the international school, I made a group of friends who seemed cool, we had all the same interests... relatively. Shitty thing was this school was literally made for geniuses and I was a fucking dumbass so I failed basically everything but it’s private so if you pay you get to get some meaningless certificate anyways so yes I got that, just not the good one, I got the lesser one which apparently isn’t even equivalent to a high school diploma even though my high school was basically only college courses. Yea, shit is fucked up. Anyways, my “friends” which I finally got after so long, decided to start making group chats without me and hanging out without me even though I was apart of their group so yea they were fucking dickheads and it took me the whole first year at that school to figure out what they were doing. Second year my family actually moved to the same city as my school which was really awesome because I was a 6 minute bike ride away instead of an 1h30 train ride. Problem was, I had no friends again. But I couldn’t just have no friends. So I kept hanging out with those dickheads and I pretended to not notice that they would hangout without me and try and hide their stupid fucking group chats from me even tho it was obvious as fuck. Then everything changed.

I met a girl. She was really amazing and we got along super well. I was always a boys kinda guy I never really had friends which were girls but this girl was different. She was so cool and I just clicked with her more than I had with anyone else before. Let’s just call her Lucy. So Lucy and I eventually started dating and i didn’t have to hangout with those dickheads anymore because I had my new bestfriend Lucy. About 2 months into the relationship she decided she wasn’t happy and wanted to go on a break. I really didn’t want to lose her so I tried to start fixing myself to cater to how she felt so that she would like me again. Which when I look back on it fucked me up a lot mentally. While we were on this break we agreed to not do anything with anyone else and that we would stay loyal. Well, yea. She cheated on me. And after I found out she told me that she just had a “vibe” with this person and that she wanted to see where things would lead with him. I was heartbroken. But obviously not heartbroken enough because 2 weeks later she decided to not pursue her vibe with this one dude and I got back together with her. Like I said, I didn’t have anyone else. We proceeded to date for another year and 5 months. About 5 months in she started acting all batshit crazy and I swear to god she was a fucking psychopath. She always wanted to fight she always was mad at me no matter what I did, I’d spend hours trying to calm her down and make her happy again just for her to flip her shit again within five minutes. But she “loved me so much”. And it felt so good to have someone love me. So I told her I loved her back. I feel really bad about this. Honestly, I don’t really know how I felt. I wanted to love her so bad, I just didn’t really feel it. I hated myself for not feeling it but it just wouldn’t come. But I couldn’t leave her. First of all I had no one else, and I was such a fucking pussy I was so goddamn scared to do it I let this shitty ass miserable relationship go on for so long and it was such a mistake. See being with her made me feel trapped because I wanted to get away from the situation but I couldn’t. 

This gave me crippling anxiety. It started out as a fear of throwing up in front of everyone and whenever I was “trapped” in a room I would feel like I was going to throw up and it was so fucking scary. Eventually it got worse and turned from the fear of throwing up when I was trapped, to a fear of having a heart attack. Which doesn’t go well with anxiety because anxiety attacks feel like heart attacks and I had anxiety about having a heart attack so yea, you can imagine how that went down. I couldn’t go anywhere where I would feel trapped. I would lose my shit in the movie theatre, I couldn’t concentrate a single second in school, I felt trapped everywhere I went. The one place I was always safe... my room. I was alone and nothing could get to me. But it got me thinking, what could stop me from having a heart attack in my room, there is no difference. So for weeks straight I swear my heart would not stop pounding, the only time it wasn’t was when I was asleep because I couldn’t think about having a heart attack but the second I woke up it was the first think on my mind and my heart would begin pounding again. It would get hard to breathe, it would become hard to eat and to drink, but I never told anyone. I don’t know why, it was hard to think straight. So finally I simply could not take it anymore and I broke up with Lucy after we graduated. I broke her heart, and I didn’t feel a thing. I finally ripped off the bandaid and I couldn’t even cry. I wasn’t able to. I lost the ability to cry at some point throughout my whole journey in Germany. I still can’t. Every once in a while I’ll explode for a few hours but that’s like once every six months. I wish I could always cry, it feels so good, but I can’t. Anyways she hates me now but we moved on and that was the end of that whole thing. I still hate all those dickheads I hung out with before Lucy. I want to move on but they are just such shit people I never met such shit people. I try though.

Anyways, remember my friends from the US. Yea I sort of kept in contact with them after I moved but honestly, I wish I hadn’t. The hardest thing in the world is seeing them on social media still growing up together while I’m here alone miserable as fuck when this is not the life I was supposed to fucking live. I don’t even know who they are anymore and they don’t fucking care to ever talk to me. They would never ask me how I am or anything they just fucking moved on. No one would talk to me unless I would reach out to them only to get dry ass responses. They assume just like everyone else I’ve ever talked to that I am fine because I always act super happy and outgoing around people but once I am alone I couldn’t be sadder, because I have no real friends to talk to. I know they still love me, cause they tell me. But I know they eventually stopped caring about me after I was gone. It hurts so bad. I hate seeing them together without me. I was always there. Now it’s too late they’re all going off to college and done being kids. I just wish we could be kids forever.

So here I am today. I have absolutely no one in my life except for my family who I love so very much but they are just so fucking annoying. They are such great people but I hate myself so much that I can’t stand them because they know how sad I am and they try to help but it pisses me the fuck off. I don’t want their help they can’t do anything for me they just want to “talk” and cry with me. I need a peer. My best friend of all time, who I didn’t even mention. My brother who is 9 years younger than me, was my rock throughout everything, but I mean, come on. How happy can I be hanging out with an 8 year old all day. It hurts so bad to turn him down because he looks up to me so much but I don’t want to play legos all day, I want to be alone and he always asks me why I’m so sad and I just have to make up some fucking excuse and turn him away at my door while he cries because I won’t hangout with him and he is lonely too because he goes to a German school and has no friends and he’s like the only person I actually care about so I fucking die inside when I see him sad but I just can’t bring myself to hangout with him because I need to be alone. Surprisingly this is what hurts me the most, out of everything

Ever since the German school I had considered just killing myself but I have never actually thought about it as a real option because it is waaaayyy too fucking scary. I wrote a suicide note at one point but that was just me being stupid. I could never bring myself to do it. There is something else. Another reason why I can’t do it. The reason is that throughout all of this, throughout all of the misery and life experiences that have fucked me up. When I am not siting in my room depressed as fuck all day. Those rare occasions when I actually am in a relatively good mood or I visit family somewhere and get to actually associate with people that say they care about me. I am still, the most outgoing, crazy, energetic, friendly, funny and loving person. So therefore I have a dream. I have this fucking terrifying dream in life. Which I want more than anything to achieve. So I live on, because for some fucking reason, I have this feeling in my heart, that I am going to achieve it. I feel like I know that I am going to do it, despite it being 1 million times bigger than the person I am. So I work hard, to achieve this dream, even though it gets so insanely hard to stay positive sometimes, because it seems like all odds are against me and nobody wants to help me out. Still, I work harder on this than I have ever worked on anything before. Because the idea of working some random desk job is the scariest thing I could ever think of and I will stop at nothing to steer clear of an occupation of the sort. That is my greatest fear: failure. 

I am not going to tell you my dream, I am sorry. I just want you to know that once I move back to the US, (because that has been my goal since moving here because I hate Germany with all of my might I am sorry but I hate it so much) I am going to be happy again. Ever since I came here I have yearned to be in the US. My birthplace, where I grew up ... my home. I have been away for too long. So, I look forward to this, as well as working towards my dream once I get there, and that is what keeps me going. And I will keep going. It’s just right now, at this point, I am stuck here in Germany living with my parents because if I stay just 6 more months I will have permanent residency in Europe which my parents basically are forcing me to stay here and get so that’s why I can’t just leave in case you were wondering. It feels just like when I was counting down towards the end of my year of hell at the German school. Which I thought for sure I would never have to experience something that terrible ever again and here I am. The worst thing is I have no idea if this will be the last time I experience one of these hells. My life is probably filled with them. But I have to get through this, otherwise I will never know if I will achieve my life long dream or not. Plus if I don’t I can always just off myself then. I feel like it will be mush less scarier at that point. But I have a feeling even if I don’t achieve my dream I will achieve something else along the way. Perhaps something that I didn’t necessarily want, but the one thing that I always needed, I just never knew.

I wanted to write this because I was feeling insanely depressed and I have really been needing someone to talk to lately, despite me being better off alone. I just haven’t had anyone for quite some time. It actually felt really good to write this out, I didn’t expect that. If you actually read all of this I really appreciate you. Thank you for listening. &lt;3"
1520,Good night,"Okay, times is up for me. I wanted to do so many things animal rights or helping women in any way. However, i lost all my hope.

1522,"""Marriage story"" the adam driver, scarlett Johansson movie...","I know I probably even shouldn't be saying this, let alone admitting it to anyone, but I never really realized how emotionless I am. I have no happiness and I haven't since I was 5 (I'm 19 now). Everything in my life is anger and sadness.

Marriage story showed me that I know I have no chance of ever falling in love. I tried with this girl a little over a  year ago. But after about 8 months of trying to feel anything I just couldn't find anything and I had already watch her spiral downhill so I left.

Does anyone know why I dont feel anything to anyone? Like I'm not trying to sound terrible but I'm not even close with my own mother. I'm a self sufficient person who just likes being alone all the time. I find human interactions completely pointless unless a transaction is being made. 

I'm not scared by this I'm just trying to figure out why I feel empty and alone."
1523,I’m so tired of everyone saying “If you don’t love yourself how are you going to love anyone else?”,"Like bitch, just stop. 

I get it that I’m not normal. But I can’t just wake up one day and say “oh boy! I’m going to love myself today! Oh yippee!” 

I wish I could go back to when I’m 11 and do the whole thing over again and just start by avoiding all the bad that has caused this confidence issue I have. I don’t think anyone will ever love me again. :/"
1525,I feel like i'm doing good... but,When i look around me.... my place is a mess. I lost control. I'm don't even know where to start to clean it...
1526,"Loneliness, worthlessness, and the fear of failure","I’m afraid of failure, much like everyone else. Failing at something makes me believe that I’m a worthless piece of shit. Like I have no talent or nothing that distinguishes me from others. I’ve been experiencing loneliness due to this fear I have. I fail to act on relationships because I’m too scared I’ll will fuck them up. I’m lucky to have good looks but I fail to act on girls I’m interested in and maybe develop a relationship. I have severe depression due to this. I’m 16 and a sophomore in high school."
1527,DAE feel like their emotions have been so numbed they’ve become almost sociopathic,"I am a highly empathetic and emotional person. So much so that it hurts. Now I’m so numbed I feel sociopathic cause I don’t give a fuck. Feel like I don’t feel anything. And along with the dissociation I’m experiencing it’s like I’m not real. I don’t recognise myself or my body and have no emotions to connect with myself. 

It’s like living in a stranger. Obviously sometimes I watch a cute video and I’m like aw I wish I could cry but I can’t lol I want to but I can’t."
1528,Not sure if I should quit my job immediately because of my depression..,"Hey, so my depression lately has been really bad lately. Money isn't an issue because I'm a teenager living my mother, and I've been hospitalized for my depression in the past, but lately my depression has been incredibly bad. Every time I go to work I feel even worse because my manager just doesn't like me and the things she says are really condescending at times, like ""I'm glad you don't have a license because you can't even drive a buggy"", and I always feel extremely weak, meaning I can't even pick up very light objects. And at work I have to pick up heavy objects for eight hours straight.   


I don't know if I should just quit without notice, go in person and tell her I can't go to work anymore/am quitting, or text her on her number, or what. I literally just don't like being there. I don't know what to do. It makes my depression worse, and every time I wake up from my phone's alarm for work I wake up crying and sobbing, which I don't even intend. I just subconsciously do that."
1529,I'm so sick of existing,"Seriously, what's the fucking point? I just want to be gone, I don't want to exist anymore. I have such a little impact on anyone's life that if I just disappeared that most wouldn't even notice. Sure some will be sad, but not much if any more than general human empathy for loss. Some say ending it is selfish, but isn't it selfish wanting someone who's suffering to continue doing so just so they themselves won't be sad?


Why keep going on, though? Other than making a very small handful of people sad, there really isn't anything keeping me here. Honestly I feel their concern is holding me hostage....
I don't care about my future, I just want to be gone......"
1530,Does anyone else feel cold?,"Serious question. Does anyone else have the odd physical symptom of feeling chills and cold from inside out whenever they are going from a decent mood down the descent to the low?

Anyone else have other physical symptoms that arent typical?"

1533,I Feel Like Something Is Violently Wrong With Me- I Just Don’t Know What,"Please excuse the format and grammar as I’m on mobile and English is not my first language. 
   
All my life I’ve found it relatively difficult to make friends. I’ve always had to be the one to initiate and oftentimes it didn’t work out at all. I know this is normal and I can’t be friends with everyone, but for the past few years I haven’t had anyone in my life.  Over time most of my friendships fizzled out despite my constant efforts to reach out and plan times to hang out. I’ve watched all my old friends find new groups and they’ve all forgotten about me. That’s fine because I know sometimes other people just have more in common.  

I’m in uni and I don’t have any friends and I haven’t for years. I’ve had a few people I’ve hung out with but they always ghost me afterwards. I’d like to have a boyfriend but that hasn’t happened either. At this point I feel like there is something wrong with me. I try and be nice and ask people about themselves, join clubs, etc. but it hasn’t help anything.   I’m just tired of feeling alone and like something is wrong with me. It seems everyone around me has a friend to talk to but I don’t. I’m not sure what I wanted from posting this - probably just to vent.  If you’ve made it this far, thanks for listening."

Fuck life, when I’m feeling fine it kicks me in the face and shoves me to the fucking ground. 

I need someone, but at the same time I can’t help but want no social interaction. One second I could be attracted to like 3 girls and the next I could be sitting in my room all day just wanting to watch YouTube and fucking sleep. God I’m fucked"

1537,i want to die because i'm fat,"that's it. i'm 27 f, 5'4 and over 200 pounds

last year i was only 155. i somehow put on all of that weight that ive ever lost again and i don't have the motivation to lose it. i just want to eat all day, drink soda, alcohol and consume massive amounts of food. everytime i look at myself in the mirror or of old photos of myself i just can't stand it. i hate myself so much. i feel so fucking disgusting and undesirable. i feel so worthless for being such a fat piece of shit.

&amp;#x200B;

the only way i know how to make myself feel better is by eating. if i'm not eating, i'm not happy. but if i cant fit into my clothes in a few months that's it. it's over for me. i won't be here anymore. fuck everything else."
1538,I don't feel like I'm wanted or belong anywhere,"First time I've done this, guess I should say a little bit about myself. I'm 19 (M) and I'm in college right now. I was born with aspergers syndrome and I haven't been able to see my therapist for months at this point. I don't feel like there's any groups on campus that would like me. I'm not very well liked in most of my classes. I feel alone and used at work (a shitty dish cleaning job that I only have because it fits with my schedule). I went to our christmas party yesterday and it was super awkward, I talked to basically just one person for two hours and ended up annoying them. I go to the gym nearly every day but I just feel like I shouldn't be there. Every online forum or friend online I have I eventually either annoy, get blocked by, or end up driving them away. I spend most of my time when I'm not studying, working out, or cleaning dishes on my PC. I'm somewhat paranoid and I have a painfully short ability to wait or be patient. 

Every sports team I've been on I just end up being mostly forgettable and mediocre. I cant name a single location I can go to other than my own room where I feel normal. I am on bad terms with half my family, the other half being all over the country.

Most of my friends have moved out of state or are so busy I barely get to see them. Whenever I make new friends I rarely try to keep up with them, yet I know I should. On the rare occasion I do, they never respond to me.

I haven't been in a serious relationship in about 3 years. I have been dumped or rejected by every single person I've fallen in love with since then. I cannot remember the last time I got a hug from someone that wasnt my Dad.

The only person in my life I feel truly valued by is my father, who spends mountains of cash on my tuition and therapy. I often talk to him about problems he say he wishes he could answer but he cannot. I can see the pain I put him through and it makes me feel ashamed of myself. 

I don't feel welcome anywhere and I dont know what to do."
1539,Haven’t ate nothing all day,I’m just tired I think it’s time for me go
1540,too much to handle,In the past week I (24f) have been dumped by a guy that I had deep feelings for. We were long distance and he basically called and told me he was having too much fun to talk to me anymore. I also was invited to a Christmas party as a joke (or they just didn’t want me to come). I was really excited about going because of my break up. I bought an ugly sweater and made cookies but the address I was given was to an abandoned building. No one answered my calls or texts but posted party pictures on Facebook. Then to top it off I was sexually assaulted by someone who I’ve know for 6 years and I thought genuinely cared about me. I even opened up to them about my depression. I haven’t had suicidal thoughts since I was 16ish but this past week has been so terrible. Way too much pain/humiliation for me to handle at once
1541,I am done.,Was accepted into college. My top choice. I don’t want to do this anymore. The only thing stopping me from jumping out the window is how cold is it outside and if I fuck up I’ll be miserable the whole time I’m freezing to death. Family has a gun but it is not functional nor does it have bullets. :(  don’t know what to do. Maybe I should just risk it and jump.
1542,Dealing with endless failures,"I’m not so much depressed because I didn’t try things. I’m depressed because everything I do ends up being in vain.

I’m surviving but I have no hope that anything will every work out in my favor. I haven’t seen life long friends in 2 years and not sure I can even look them in the face. I don’t feel like I can laugh.

I think I have a similar feeling to failed startup founders but multiple that by 6 consecutive failures.

My life sucks and I don’t see how drugs could help unless they’re going to make me forget who I am. My only option is to push forward and improve my circumstances but again my hope levels are so low I’m having trouble getting up back on the horse.

1544,Depression has blinded me and has made me waste years of my life,"All of these years I was convinced that I was doing horribly at uni and that I was worthless because of it. This idea even served as the catalyst for a depressive episode I had at the start of last summer in which I nearly committed suicide. Today I was applying for internships and had to give my current GPA. I then realized how blinded I've been: I have 3.8... in my senior year. I can't believe how stupid I've been. All the self hatred because of my supposed failing academic career was not only pointless, but baseless. I wasted these past years trying to get the best grade possible. I guess I did it, but at the cost of an almost non existent social life, a destroyed body because I continually starved myself so I could make more time to study, no romantic life at all, TONS of wasted opportunities, etc, etc... All because I desperately wanted an A on a piece of paper.

These past months have been transformative for me psychologically. I've improved far beyond what I thought I was capable of. I just wish I had started sooner. Luckily, there may still time to right my wrongs.

Sorry that this turned out to be a bit of a rant. Also, english isn't my first language, so excuse any mistakes."

This year has been the absolute hardest year of my

I wish I could see a bright side or a way out of this. I am so alone. I am so lost. I don’t see an end to this pain. I don’t deserve sympathy. I deserve all the bad things that are happening to me. I wreck the people I love. I can’t be trusted. Everything is completely falling apart and I can’t fix any of it. It’s too late to make up for the mistakes that I made. I just want out of this existence. I’ll never have love. I don’t deserve it. I hate waking up every day and having to be me. Having to relive those horrible things I’ve done. Every one deserves so much more and I have nothing to give. I fucked up. I ruined everything. I’ve always ruined everything. I sabotage every good thing in my life. I’m sorry. So fucking sorry.

1548,TO ANYONE STRUGGLING,"So, I started to write a comment on someone's post about how they believe it inevitable that they will someday kill themselves, and then it got a little out of hand. I just wanted to make a post with my original comment in the hopes that it will reach, and hopefully help someone, anyone at all. It is addressed to the OP of the post, but the message is for anyone struggling and feeling hopeless. I'm right there with you, and I don't want you or I or anyone else to suffer like this.

Here is the comment:

\~

Hey...

How old are you? No, age doesn't really have to affect this at all. You can be young or you can be old, poor or rich, lonely or surrounded by friends, successful or a complete ""failure"" by your own standards (or that of others, and f\*\*\* what they say, honestly. They don't know you!), but what really matters is that little spark inside your own brain.

YOU!

You control those thoughts, whether you believe it or not. I have now been at my absolute worst. I can sit here and question, ""Was that really the worst? What if it comes again, and what if this time--"" ... You have to not let yourself think that way.

There was someone here on Reddit a long time ago, or maybe it was elsewhere.. They left what they probably thought was a very simple comment, yet it really spoke loudly to me. They said, ""The brain has fire-hose sized neural pathways towards negative thought and emotion, and it has hair-width thin neural pathways towards all that is positive.""

For someone struggling with severe, seemingly incurable depression, this sunk in. It made me realize, wait... I can control this. It's just extremely difficult. But, that doesn't mean it is impossible. Now, your brain might be thinking, ""Ok, well, maybe this is true. But, I know how much more the depression hurts when I try my hardest,"" because we take the easy route for a reason - It is less taxing on our nerves and our psyche, ""So, if I try my hardest, and expend all my mental and emotional energy towards this light at the end of the tunnel--that I don't know for sure I will ever be able to reach--and it turns out that I fall hard, REALLY HARD, all the way back to ground zero, I just KNOW I will have to kill myself then.""

...I've been here. I've had the same pattern of thoughts. I've sat and thought, with the belief that it is true, ""It will either be a choice, or it will be a moment of such severe, such IMMENSE pain, that you can't control it, or yourself, and you will find any way out of that pain, whether it's taking a bunch of pills, finding the nearest hig-hrise, opening the gun-safe, or running into the road after running, crying, manically and hysterically, with no destination or purpose because you are that lost and that pained from life.""

That's how I have believed my life/death will play out. And you know what? I'm not coming from a place of ""been there, done that, now I'm past it."" No.. I had one of these moments last night. And I'm telling you, this life will seem as dark as your mind's eye says it is. Sometimes that eye is shut because it needs rest. It sees too much pain inside of us, and that night air outside seems to just carry nothing but a lack of hope, a deep darkness and the foreboding, lingering feeling of a day that will make us regret ever going to sleep tonight without the plan of not waking up in the morning... And yet, another you, a you that might exist tomorrow, will feel the calmness in that night's breeze. You'll look outside and feel that night air calmly remind you of one more day that you GET to have on this Earth and make the most of it.

There's pain now. It's heavy.

It doesn't have to stay.

I'm there with you. I told myself last night--I told OTHERS last night, who tried to help me--that, ""I don't see the point. The effort it is going to take and the way it is going to drain me is going to leave me weaker for that next moment that blows up into a chaos of pure depression and hopelessness. What is the point of life if it is an enormous amount of pain every day just to find that one moment, that little sliver of happiness somewhere in the future that fades just as quickly again once it's over..?""

If I had let myself blow my brains out last night, as I very desperately wanted to, I would have hurt someone who means more than this world to me. Yeah, the world's shit sometimes, so maybe that doesn't mean much. Let's see. Let's say they mean more than my pride... They mean more than the ability to let go. They mean more than it means to me to give myself an excuse. They mean more to me than to need happiness for 11 years. I would be a martyr in for pain for them in this LIFE, because it would be the opposite of what a martyr normally is. I wouldn't be dying for them. I would be doing what is much more difficult. I would be staying ALIVE for them, despite anything. This person doesn't have to be your S.O. Maybe it's your Twin Flame, your best friend, a family member.

Sometimes we don't have anybody. When I was 19, I had given up on being romantic. I didn't think anyone could ever love me again. I thought I was unattractive. I thought many lowly things of myself. And yet I had some small, strange little pride in myself that I was better than anyone mentally. It didn't help me stay alive. It made me believe I was in a world that I didn't agree with or feel I belong in. Guess, what I still feel I don't agree with this world, but I belong here because this is Earth. This is where humans were planted by the universe. They make their own trouble, and I don't have to be a part of it. I have my own trouble. Regardless, when I was 19, I was still a hopeless romantic, but some part of me gave up. The next thing I knew, I was 24, and I had been single for 5 years. I didn't date a single person. I didn't even have sex. I only visited with some very un-close friends about once a month. (That was my choice. I have never been very social.) I realized, or thought, that I lacked a lot of relationship experience because of these 5 years lacking, and then I found I had something that not many others did. I had the experience of a relationship with myself. I discovered my own thoughts and who I truly felt like I was. It wasn't the Me that others imposed on me. It was a me that was very deep, very profound, and yet still with many immature, misplaced thoughts and opinions. When I dated again, I experienced strange, small jealousies over things that shouldn't affect me. I experienced a lack of will towards certain things, certain activities, and found other people's company to still be an annoyance at times. I beat myself up for it--BUT THE POINT IS: I have been suicidal while completely alone, and I have been suicidal while someone is even dating me and making me feel like the world... When I was about 22-24, I realized it was myself that was worth living for. I recognized my dreams and potential, and I was a new person. I never, ever in a million years thought that I could be that kind of positive person. ..And guess what..? It DID bottom out. I lost all of that positivity after my 25th birthday at the very end of 2014. 2015 was a dark year for me. I still haven't bounced back yet. I want to find myelf, the me that was here at 24, and part of the reason it is extremely difficult is because of things out of my control: my health.

My health had really contributed to a downfall that I didn't bother stopping. I gave up on many places in my life and just considered them un-salvageable, and I devoted myself to causes for other people that were not only entirely self destructive to myself, but that didn't aid others either in the way that I intended. I left behind the most important person to have ever entered my life back then out of that lack of hope. Abandoning them was my soul's way of saying, ""Well, I'm going to die anyway. They're me essentially. They are my happiness and my survival, so... I'll see you in the next life, my friend. 'Maybe on the Dark Side we will be together.' ...Until then..."" And from there, of course I was bound to fail. I made myself a martyr in the wrong way and for the wrong purpose. I devoted my life to my inevitable fate, to the inevitable fate that we ALL face: Death...

This is a long speech to say this, but I feel that when someone feels that they wish to die, whether it's right-the-hell-now, or far-unto-the-future, they deserve more than just a few words. They deserve to see someone is willing to give them their story and not for the sake of telling their story, but for the sake of sharing a message. My message:

Be a martyr until you find that happiness, but not a martyr that sacrifices your life. Don't plan to die. Plan to live. Don't sacrifice your life. Sacrifice that inherent (and sometimes very unhealthy need, for us struggling with suicidal thoughts and depression) need to feel that ""happiness around the corner"" RIGHT NOW... If you don't feel it right now, maybe there is something missing, just maybe, and you can't tell yourself it will never come. Also, don't rely on it. I used to have ambitions and dreams of such grandeur that I could never live up to, the kind that rely on such circumstance that not many in life get to achieve...

... Every time I give a speech like this, no matter what I say, I always feel it is not enough. I can't reach out and hold your hand and keep you in this world. I know what it's like, and I know what it's like when nothing helps. Just remember, I'm struggling right beside you. It was my birthday yesterday. I am 30 years, 22 hours, and 11 minutes old.

I never thought I would make it to be 30. I never thought I would make it to be 20, or even 18, 17, 16... This life sure is tough. It's even tougher for those like us.

I try to always offer this, and it's rare anyone accepts the invitation, and that's quite alright, but... If you need to talk, I'm here. I'm not someone who's ""been there, done that."" .. I'm someone who has been there and is still there, and who just happens to have a will that is so incredibly strong because it is fighting a pain so immensely great even as I write this.

I won't die from suicide. I won't let myself. It would betray everything I stand for. When I was single, had no one in this world, I can remember moments that I felt more proud than anytime in my life. I was me, and no one could take that from me.

Now, I have someone I care deeply for. I care for them in a way that not many people get to experience in this life, and you know what? I may lose them. I may lose them due to my lack of hope over the past year, and the depths I have let myself and my life sink to.

If I lose them, I'll be okay. As long as they are alive, I'll be okay. And even if they died? ..I'm going to pretend--no, not pretend, I'm going to KNOW--that they are watching me, holding my hand, waiting for me, and that the longer I live, the longer I strive on and the more I THRIVE in this life, the happier I will make them and the bigger that smile is that I will bring to their face. They could marry someone else, and I wouldn't even care. They're no less mine, and I'm no less theirs. It's a connection that just can't be broken.

Not everyone gets to have that connection, and you don't need it. I didn't need it before I found it, and please, anyone reading this: DO NOT ENVY IT OR CRAVE IT... Loving someone so deeply does not always make life easier. It can make it HARDER... You know how hard it is to live? Being just yourself is one thing. Now imagine two of you. It's immense pressure. It's incredibly difficult. But, I won't give up. So, I'm extending my hope to you, OP, and to all reading this, and I can already feel all those of you who extend your hope to me as well, so thank you.

Let's all stay alive for one another, but most of all, let's stay alive for OURSELVES.

When sadness so great comes at you with it's knives and daggers, digging into you, making this life unbearable, stand tall and say whatever curse word, whatever statement of strength you need to tell it off. Tell it that it doesn't not own you. It's the bad side of your conscience trying to drag you down, and you're stronger than it. I've never felt better about myself than when I can be the strongest during moments of the most immense pain. I'm not happy right now. I'm feeling solace. It's not an unrealistic hope or a numbness to the pain I'm feeling right now. It's just gathering that will to survive.

And, lastly... You need to question not only moments of pure sorrow, but also of unrealistic, surprising and overwhelming feelings of happiness or contentment as well. When those come, don't just set yourself back into a sadness by telling yourself they aren't real. If necessary, or if it works for you, simply tell those happy feelings the same thing. Laugh in its face, and say, ""(Hahahaha!) You think I'm just sticking around here for you? No. I'm here to live. I'm here to experience the highs and the lows and to let it give birth to creativity, to growth, to a better life.""

... That's all.

Dream as if you have forever.

Live as if you have only today.

Love the ones you love as if you only have them for today. Love them as if you will never see them or hear from them again. Never question them. Let them be free. Give them everything that you would wish them to give to you.

And give yourself those same things.

Don't wait for someone else to come along and give it to you.

Life isn't easy. Do you want to die having not tried at all? Or do you want to die on your feet, fighting? Your life is an invisible war, and you don't need fame. Be your own hero in that war and save yourself. You're worth it.

Don't wait for life to give you that ""Chance.""

JUST TAKE IT."
1549,I hate every my entire abusive family and want to die but too cowardly,Ever since I was a kid I was hated on and abused and taken advantage of to crazy depths. I just want to never see any of them ever again and get what I deserve what I helped to get while getting abused along the way the whole time. I want to move away and start over. But they dont care at all and I am trapped. At least I know I dont have to and won't talk to them ever again. But I just want to kill myself. I have no desire to ever socialize w cruel abusive ppl ever again. I just wish that euthanasia drug drink was available. World is so cruel and abusive and only wants you to suffer and to take advantage of you.
1550,I wish it was summer all year,"I dread the winter, mostly because the sun is out less than usual than it is in summer. My dad said that people with seasonal depression suffer badly in winter. The sun is our friend, it's no joke! It helps us with our moods and helps us sleep better. 

I started dreading the sun going down early probably in late October when the sun started setting at around 5 or at least 5:30 pm. Nowadays, the sun sets at around 4:30 from where I live and I actually hate it! I'm just coming home from work and I love going for walks, but now I have to exercise indoors. It's not the same. At work, I have these anxious thoughts of darkness and cold. I wish I could stay far south, but just not sure where exactly. 

For those who have seasonal depression, I'm here with you. While we can't tell the sun to stay out longer in winter, we can just hope that summer comes quickly in 2020!"
1551,About posts in this sub,"When I make a post on here, I get a little anxious waiting for replies. I don't know, I keep thinking about it and once in awhile check if it was at least upvoted. And when anyone reply my post after a certain time and I think that nobody will reply anymore I get a little sad.

Anyone else feeling like this or it's just me?"
1552,No Energy,"I have no energy to do the things I love anymore. I come home and lay in bed and stare at the ceiling and procrastinate my projects for school. I feel I'm pretty extraverted, but lately I just want to be alone. All my friends switched up but I'm too scared to say anything or stand up for myself. I just take it. I feel I have no time for anything anymore. Just time to be alone and stare at nothing. Please help me."
1553,Weird mood swings?,"Lately I’ve been having really weird mood changes. Like I’d be really depressed for a week then feel better for a week, almost like I’m high. Then I’d feel normal for about 3 weeks/a month then depressed again. Does anyone know what this is or why it’s happening?"
1554,Depressed because of things you can't change,"I've been depressed about a physical trait of mine for nearly over a month now. When i was younger, i developed a scar on one of my eyelids. which causes one of my eyelids to look pretty weird compared to the other.

Logically, i know its not really noticeable, only in certain lighting, but if you notice it, like i do myself, i think it sucks..its made me super depressed for a while. I can't stop staring at the mirror, thinking i would be happy with myself and how i look, if it was just gone. 

Its worse because i'm in highschool right now, and while my life should really just be starting, I already feel like part of it is over. I feel like it looks weird, girls wont like it. etc. etc.

I know not everyones happy about their appearance, but to me this sucks because its something i'm stuck with, i mean how many other kids have to deal with weird scars on their eyelids. I used to be skinny, but a lot of people dont have perfect bodies, i went to the gym and made myself feel better about that. I used to have acne, but a lot of teenagers do, i took better care of my skin and it went away. But this? i can't do anything about this but stare at it, and think about how unfortunate it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I know its super vain, maybe narcisisstic, but it just bothers me. Everynight, i spend a long time, talking to myself, teling mysefl that its not that bad, everyone has their own insecurities, but then i go to school, look around at all my classmates who have ""normal"" faces. I mean not everyone is attractive, but at least they dont have scars on their eyes... whatever thats my rant."
1555,If i just shoot myself in a non lethal area will people finally care?,"Nobody cares and nobody ever will. I don’t want to kill my self just yet, but maybe if i shoot myself in a place where i may not die but only become severely injured, will anyone care then?  Probably not."
1556,"“You do the things you do, because you don’t feel worthy”","Yup, pretty much! I’ve changed my whole life around, started hitting the gym, quit porn, quit weed, watched my diet, cold showers, meditated, all that good jazz, only to still feel like shit about myself. 

When someone said “you only do those things because you don’t think your worthy, and you think those things will make you worthy” I fucking agreed, like yea dude, I make myself look good so I feel good, I wear nice clothes to feel good about myself. Specially when my childhood was filled with never giving a shit about myself. 

Yet even after doing everything I can to make myself happy I still have nights like this where I feel so disconnected from everyone... People always say you gotta love yourself before anyone loves you, what the fuck does that even mean? I did the stuff that I thought made me happy and man... I’m just not. Can’t explain it. 

I did this all on my own, got off social media so I stopped seeking validation for my looks, don’t hangout with many people, and just did this all on my own. I am happy I turned my life around, but when that dude told me I did that shit cuz I didn’t feel worthy it hit me like bricks... 

I say fuck that guy, I worked hard on myself for myself, but... I don’t even know what to believe anymore."
1557,Had to scrape vomit off the side walk,"I work a minimum wage job at a fast food joint and had to scrape off vomit from the pavement from a drunk person. On top of that I had a co-worker mocking me when talking to people in drive thru .

Now I can understand that this is a toxic environment but,  I also get called stupid and ugly at school (in my senior year of highschool). I have a hard time following orders and get confused a lot, it really makes me feel like I have no place in this world and I have no potential. I do good in school but outside of that I'm utterly worthless.

I've been thinking about volunteering to a non-profit that builds houses for the poor but I rarely have enough time to hang out with friends as is.."
1558,Can anyone recommend a book to UNDERSTAND (not cure) depression?,"I'm currently going through counseling. I was once diagnosed with Bipolar 2. I think I might have ADHD. I know I have anxiety, and I know I *get* depressed, but I don't know what causes it. I recently learned I don't know anything about depression. I didn't know it came back. I don't know anything other than the common idea that it makes you sad, or empty.

Can anyone please recommend a good book to actually explain this disease to me? All I can find are books that try to show you how to get rid of it. I feel like I can't do that until I understand where it's coming from (bipolar, or depression).

Thanks."
1559,I'm happy,I'm happy wowee no scarcasm at all wooooweee im super happy yehaw
1560,I don’t want to die anymore,"I can’t remember the last time that I didn’t want to just end it. But that changed today. For the first time in a long time, I’m enjoying life. It makes me tear up to think about how miserable I was but I feel great now. I’ve experienced the times where I feel great and then crash but this is different. I feel amazing. Thank you to everyone who supported me and offered advice."
1561,"I wish I could just say ""I'm feeling depressed"" instead of constantly making excuses to explain myself","Sometimes I am just too depressed to get out of bed or to meet up with friends. But just saying ""I am depressed"" is never a good enough excuse to people. It feels like they completely ignore what I say which forces me to come up with a ""better"" excuse like ""Feeling sick today"". Just wish I could say ""Feeling depressed"" and have people understand."
1562,Does anyone else feel like their depression is contingent upon their anxiety?,"When I really sit back and think about my life and mental health, it seems as though my anxiety is actually what fuels my depression.
There’s something I don’t like or that makes me uncomfortable.. I ruminate upon it .. and that makes me depressed.
I wonder if my anxiety went away, if my depression would go away as well?

But the deepest fear is.. even if my life became perfect , and I had no anxieties whatsoever ... if I would still be depressed."
1563,I don't really have anyone to talk to But...,"Today I cleaned one room of my house completely, did a load of laundry, and cleaned all of my dishes.  This may not seem like a lot, but I have really been struggling lately.  The rest of my house is still extremely dirty, but I will try to clean another room tomorrow.  The rest of my life seems to be falling apart all over, and for the past about 8 months I have done nothing about it.  I guess I have to start some place.  This sounds so pathetic as I type it out, but I'm trying."
1564,Empty inside,Im so tired of acting like im happy. I cant even make my girlfriend happy. I cant feel anything but that's my normal at this point. People see me as a scary guy but im just trying to fix myself but its not working and it sucks because being constantly avoided when all i want and need is help.
1565,I’m heartbroken. And I can’t function,"It’s getting worse. It’s been over 2 weeks and I’ve already had a brief period where I could sort of distract myself and convince myself it would work out and I’d get him back. Now the reality is setting in and oh my god I can’t do this. I BARELY could before I knew him. Now I know what I’m missing... I just can’t do it. He’s the reason my mental health improved so much that I could get a job and keep it. I can’t even think of doing college work right now, part of me wants to drop out because I just can’t do anything. I don’t know what I need. The one thing I need I can’t get. This hollowness in my chest feels like it will never go away. I’m eating my feelings, which is something I never do... last time I went through something like this I actually lost like 30 pounds. I’m working tomorrow and part of me wants to tell them I mentally cannot do it"
1566,Bipolar depression,"I’m taking medications Prozac Abilify and Depakote. Sometimes it feels as if I have loose screws. People who said I am bright will turn around and say I’m dumb. I feel like without my meds, I’m a disorganized and dangerous to myself and sometimes other people. I used to think that smoking trees would help treat my depression, but I have been short on bills and having problems getting a steady job. I feel the process of onboarding scares me. I also was diagnosed with agoraphobia (can’t be embarrassed or out myself out there). The anxiety holds me down like a prison. I am currently winning the battle but the war is never ending. Thanks for just reading I love everybody here and see that we all share something in common, we are not alone!"
1567,I don’t know if I have depression.,"
Kinda like the title says, I (20/M) don’t know if I have depression or if I’m just sad. 

Also, apologies for the probably awful formatting. I’ve never done a long post like this before and I don’t know how to organise my thoughts. 

I can be happy. I watch stuff, can laugh around people, all that stuff - but the second that I’m alone or have a moment to think, I just go sad and numb, and I feel a sinking feeling in my stomach. 

I distract myself by mainly watching TV and scrolling through social media. I don’t like doing this, but it’s all I can bring myself to do for hours or days at a time. At the end of the day I hate that that’s all I’ve done but a lot of the time I can’t motivate myself to move and do things. 

I know for sure I’ve felt this way since the end of 2016, but I think it was happening before then but I just didn’t recognise it. 

I can’t start anything. I want desperately to have passion for something. There are so many things I want to do - filmmaking, stand up comedy, travelling, but I just cannot summon the will to start any of these things, and it’s really upsetting. I buy stuff to try and get myself to do it, but then a year later it just makes me upset knowing I haven’t done anything with them. 

I also genuinely don’t think I have many friends. There are plenty of people I’m friendly and civil with. But no one ever messages me or invites me to anything. Hell, a group of my housemates from university travelled 60 miles to the city where I’m living currently for a night out and didn’t tell me. I genuinely think that everyone is indifferent to whether I’m around or not. 

Nobody knows anything about me. I’ve been so scared of both opening up to people as well as trying these new things that I don’t have a personality. I’m just a blank slate in the eyes of most people I know. It really gets to me, I’ve known people for years and they don’t know anything about me. 

I strongly hate everything about myself. I hate the way my mind works, as a result of all this bad thinking I think it’s pushed people away. I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been. I managed to lose 20KG from being 90KG and was pretty happy with where I was, but I have a bad relationship with food and so over the past year I’ve put all the weight back on and am currently somewhere around 97KG (I don’t know exactly because I can’t bring myself to weigh myself). I can’t stand the sight of myself. I’m the most self-conscious I’ve ever been and I hate being around people who saw me when I was slimmer. I think I look disgusting. 

I get really upset by things recently as well. I saw a post the other day about how much easier it is to lose weight with a gym buddy and it made me remember that I’ve never had someone close enough that would go with me. 

I don’t think it’s serious enough to be classed as depression though. I can force myself out of bed when I have something to do, like work. And whenever I read other people’s stories about it, it always sounds a lot more debilitating than what I’m feeling. I genuinely think half the time that I’m just sad but I can’t make it better. 

I’m booking myself in with an appointment with a counsellor. But last time I tried (around a year ago) I really struggled to open up and stopped going after one session."
1568,Is it coming back?,"About a year and a half ago, after 8 long years, my depression just seemed to go away. Sounds wacky I know, not really sure how it happened. I had, what I’d class as, severe depression. I regularly thought about suicide, and I self harmed quite a bit.  I never got any help for it and tried to deal with it best I could. About 3 years ago I had a pretty traumatic break up, and that spiralled me into the deepest pain I’d ever felt, I stayed alone for almost 2 years and wallowed in self pity and pain. And that is when my depression just sort of went away. I woke up one day and I just felt fine, it’s a weird thing to explain. Like, nothing changed in my life, it’s more something just clicked in my mind. I know it sounds ridiculous.

Now that I’ve felt happiness for the first time in what feels like forever, I’m paranoid that it’s coming back. Today I’m feeling down, for no reason, I’m feeling pain again. I feel like I want to hurt myself and make myself suffer, and I don’t know why. Is it returning? What do I do? I don’t want to feel that again. I’m scared of spiralling again."
1569,Don't let yourself destroy everything,"Hey everyone, I write that to let some things out.

Basically how my life went :
I never really felt love, lost my sister when I was about 15yo, never really went to school, addicted to video games and being mean for the sake of making people feel like I feel for a second. Didn't do too much too much with my life before and after that, stopped going to school at 18, (Lowest degree), left my parents home at 20 thanks to my girlfriend.

Lately it's not going well with my girlfriend, all thanks to me, I don't want you guys to lose your SO like I'm actually doing.

I want to do efforts for her, about everything, but I still feel the void in me, I don't want to tell her because I don't want her to think she's not good enough, I keep saying lies like ""It's my work"" because I don't want her to think that she doesn't make me happy, it's just this constant void that won't go away, or that I don't know how to fill.

This is actually destroying our relationship, on moral and sexual sides.

So if you find a person that makes you happy, so everything you can, don't lie, don't stay there like a F-in tree, you can do what I'm failing to do, and go out of that undying spiral, because if you can't do that and you love the person more than anything, you might damage yourself too in the process.

If you don't manage to move by yourself, schedule things, even if it's to clean a table, cuz if you're where I am, you won't even get up to do it.

Do these efforts for him/her, do it for yourself."
1570,I got a job,"Finally, after I don't know how many posts here (and on suicidewatch) with this account and other previous one, I got a job.

Its's not great and the pay is shit ,but I was unemployed for too long. Also, I have no experience, so I have to start somewhere.

I want to thank everyone here and say to all of you to keep resisting."
1571,My girlfriend only leaves bed to get food and smoke cigarettes. How can I help her?,"My girlfriend has clinical depression, as do I. She takes daily meds that help her a lot but she won’t leave bed. It just comes across as her being lazy but I know there’s more to it. 
She’ll wake up at 10am, play games on her phone until 11pm and then go to sleep and rinse and repeat. 
The only times she leaves bed is to get food and have cigarettes (about a pack a day).
Her health is declining and she’s put on a lot of weight over the last 2 years.
I try to be supportive and suggest things we can do. Even small things like sitting in the lounge room but she just gets annoyed at me.
I’m going mad sitting in that room with her. The darkness and nothingness is terrible. 
How can I help her?"
1572,Does anyone else kind of get their depression bad in cycles?,"I am always down cause the depression but when I get a job it goes well for like a month and then I just feel this ridiculous anxiety and sadness and then the overall not wanting to do anything and it’s sucks. As I type this I am fidgeting and hating things, how do i help this? I have to work tomorrow and I don’t want to quit yet another job"
1573,Disappearing and rebuilding??,"Does anybody else constantly get the impulse to just disappear from everyone they know and rebuild themselves? The thought of death and suicide SCARES ME, but yet it still constantly crosses my mind. I feel like I have let my self and my family down. 

I gamble because I am depressed, I dont leave my house because I am depressed, I smoke copious amounts of weed because im depressed, and when I drink alcohol I get blackout drunk because im depressed. Yes I agree these bad habits defiantly amplify my depression, but these seem to be my only method of fulfillment these days. I love trying to make other people happy, when I make people smile it makes me smile. But as I also suffer with anxiety, I am constantly under the impression that I am just pissing people off when I am there, rather than making them happy. 

I just dont know what to do anymore, I love and care for my family too much for suicide to be an option, yet it still consistently crosses my mind. The older I am getting the worse my anxiety seems to become. Making it more and more difficult to speak to new people and even close friends, resulting in my depression becoming worse! IDK I just needed to get it off my chest and I am glad I found this sub forum, because I believe with each others help, we can all make it through this dark and temporarily phase together."
1574,idgaf im gone to everyone,"everything hurts i cant . think i keep pushing people away i cant stop it i cant stop isolating myself from everyone.  i just feel so vulnerable i cant trust anyone i hate everyone i couldnt give a single fuck about anyone thats there why do i have to be with them why do i have to be with anyone at all

i miss some people i guess some i like and some i just i miss them so much but now i cant give a shit because they werent the person i knew i just thought for once i was welcome and now now i dont know what to do i dont want to see theirfaces hear their voices feel their presence

i really dont care i really dont give a fuck about you you should have treasured all my fucks for you i was trying to find you i was trying to find meaning i was trying for once to live 

and you just realise all of it is just;, fake everything all isnt real no one is real i dont know anyone no one knows me and it hurts to know that you poured your heart into believing the plastic i dug was really you 

for once i tried to step out and now i come back into hiding, and i cant stop"
1575,Wish I could just start another life as another person,"Hey all, I’ve dealt with on and off depression since I was 8. Had a super weird childhood and it wasn’t bad like I had the middle class experience but just shitty family situations especially with my dad that have left me with so many insecurities and a lot of anger.

I’m not gonna harp on the weird stuff from when I was younger and the situations with my dad and his wives but my depression became more frequent when I finally moved in with my dad my freshman year after him being in and out of my life because of the military and him finally retiring opened up a chance to actually get to know him. He had 7 deployments as a TACP in the AF so at the time not counting his TDY and him just not wanting to be around my mom he hadn’t been around me for most of my life with me about to turn 14 when I moved in with him.

I remember being so excited to get to know him because I always idolized him. I remember football being our common interest and I played through most of high school and always tried to impress him. I really began feeling insecure when he wasn’t really wanting to bond with me or anything he just wanted to go out with his second wife at the time. I remember tweaking my shoulder my sophomore year on a bad arm tackle on my part and my dad not really bothering to do much about it. I still have a messed up right shoulder. This is a sign of what was to come with my dad. 

He divorced my stepmom at the time and it was a big shock because he promised stability when I moved in with him because all my childhood was moving around and him being like a stranger to me so it hurt a little but I sucked it up and would just agree to everything to try and make him happy and have some middle ground. I always and still for some reason felt like I owed him something and it genuinely hurts knowing I thought I’d stop feeling that around 14-15 and here I am still carrying the weight of it. That aside, the spring semester of my sophomore year we got an apartment and I transferred to my second of four high schools I’d go to. My dad promised there’d be guy time and that didn’t last. He’d always say I’d never want to hang out but when he would do something with me, which was always the same thing, go to Buffalo Wild Wings and have the most awkward and forced conversations in between our NFL banter (the only thing we can talk about). 

I remember around mid to late April of that year my dad has started dating a girl in Arizona and would fly out to see her every here and there. At that point I was like whatever, and thought it was nice having the place to myself. Until, at one point he went out of town and his ex/second wife is at the door crying about the divorce because it was still in process while they were separated. It hurt me because she was a good woman and it just didn’t work for my dad because he wanted younger and flashier I’m not going to pretend I couldn’t tell why he divorced her. I texted my dad and he just said to turn the lights off and don’t leave and his ex wife just stood out there crying for hours and then I spent the rest of my night crying too. For some reason I felt it was my fault and I always have an inclination to feel this way. I later found out my dad has included me in a lie saying that me and him were on a camping trip together. As to why his ex wife came to the apartment when he told that is beyond me but my dad also includes me in this same lie later with the girl from Arizona. 

In June a few months later, my dad is about to end it with Arizona girl and he didn’t come home for 3-4 days and I find out from his Instagram (he’s a younger dad. Early 40’s) he has a new girl friend. I didn’t say anything about him being gone when he came back but I was confused and hurt and began to realize he didn’t care at that point. This girl he started dating out of nowhere is now his current fiancé and she enabled him to care less and less about his kids. Funny thing is that my dad has his Arizona girlfriend over one last time in mid June (flew her in) and told his current fiancé/third wife that me and him were camping. I remember finding that out in April of 2018 at my grandmas funeral in front of him and the look on his face when he realized. He got the benefit of the doubt when I was crying around family because his mom passed. 

Going back from that June however, I continued at the same school until October when my dad moved me (he left me alone in that apartment after the summer began because he was always at his fiancés part of town) to a townhouse right by his fiancés. She had kids and my dad always stayed over there and said I was always welcome to hang out there too but I always get uncomfortable and out of place. It hurt how he wanted to go out every night with his fiancé but would be like “seriously?” If I asked him to sign something for school. Now I’m at school #3 and that’s when my confidence took a big hit. Junior year I quit football and got into music which my dad was never supportive of, or anything really except the military. I stayed in the town house by his fiancés and just did my own thing and worked. 

That summer my dad and his fiancé get a house and so I’m on to school #4 and at this point I just stopped caring. The depression and feelings i had since my freshman year moving in with him were turned to pure anger. Senior year was the angriest year of my life and for good measure. I tore my ACL and meniscus playing basketball in early August of 2018 and my dad and I didn’t know as I was pretty healthy and never got hurt but he refused to take me to the hospital when I begged him. I started my fourth school on crutches and was extremely shy and introverted which was a slow change from how I was such an extroverted kid through elementary and middle school. Eventually I could walk on my bad leg with no crutches but my knee felt wrong the whole time. I finally got an MRI on December and found out it was my ACL and meniscus and my doctor was shocked but said it was common for some people to go on and not know so I guess that had to have made my dad forget how he totally ignored my request to literally get my leg fixed. 

Ended my senior year and moved out. I’ve been bitter since the beginning of that year. I can’t join the military because I tried getting a waiver for my knee surgeries and due to the circumstances of my ACL and meniscus tears and how my rehab wasn’t smooth. I was furious. I loved to run and work out and now I feel like that’s another piece of me missing. I’ve been so miserable and I wish every day I could just start a new life as a new person. I don’t care if it’s in a different country being born in Africa, I don’t care if it’s wherever to whoever. I just want a chance at another life and not feeling and harboring these feelings of cold anger and gut tightening depression. I’ve tried religion but it never worked for me. Went to church for a year during my freshman year every Sunday during my dads second marriage and that’s the closest I ever got and every time I try again it feels pointless. I don’t think I could ever kill myself because of my mom and little sister and my uncle on my moms side that’s been a dad to me, but I wouldn’t be opposed to dying if some accident happens you know? I used to have recurring dreams when I was in middle school of a home invasion and me usually trying to fight back and wake up. The dream eventually turned towards me letting myself get “shot” and just wake up. I didn’t know what to make of it when I was younger and I haven’t had a dream like that since I was in 7th grade probably but I seriously would just let someone kill me like that (please don’t interpret that as suicide by cop). I wish I could afford therapy on my own and part of me doesn’t want to have to tell this all again because it brings out the most raw feelings I’ve felt and it only makes me angrier. Coming back to my main question, does anyone else feel like they wish they could be someone else in a new life and just play the lottery again figuratively?"

1580,"Hello Reddit, I want to write this out so maybe I can help someone out there with their problem.","My writing is not that great, so bare with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the age of 20 I did not know what I wanted to do for a career (As most 20 year olds are). I flunked out of high school so right there I thought I was already on the wrong track. However, I have tried so many different jobs as the years went on. I went from an office typing hundreds of entry's a day, working as a Cook at a Hotel&amp;Restaurant to working with sheet metal in a construction like setting. I needed help finding out what I wanted to do for a career. So, I turned to Job Corps. I learned how to make delicious food and landed a Hotel Cook job in Las Vegas after my time at Job Corps. The first year working I thought to myself. ""I found out what I wanted for a career. This is tolerable, I can do this."" However, I was still feeling missing something. I could never figure out what it was. Every day I felt like I was wasting my time and energy into what ever I was doing. Everything that I tried I felt like it didn't matter because my life was still empty with or without a career. I moved from Las Vegas to Oregon to be with my family because I didn't know what else to do for me to feel happier. I was happy for about 1-2 months and it went back to 'normal' again. What I mean by 'normal' is me feeling depressed and useless. You might think I'm exaggerating but I really am not. Every day I would worry about money and my life. So, I would fix the money problem with getting a crappy job. Then after about 2 weeks I would feel even worse than I did without money. So, I didn't know what was happening. I quit many jobs like that. Which turned into dwindling my family's financial because I didn't pay rent and I didn't want to work. Hell I didn't even want to live this life. Sometimes during the drive to work I thought about driving straight into a tree. This is no joke and I don't mean to be like that, but it's the truth. I asked myself this and this goes to a lot of aspects in life. ""Who would do anything if you or the people around you had a worse outcome?"" So, I knew I would never actually drive straight into a tree hoping to end my life. I would hurt many people who cared for me. 

I always wondered how people can work a crappy job and feel okay with it and tolerate it. I always thought ""Is this how life feels and people just deal with it?"" ""Am I just different or am I just extremely lazy to a point of depression?"" This took years to figure out why people can work a crappy job and be okay with it. I believe that they are able to work that crappy job because they are passionate about something in their life. I thought that was the case because I found out that I lack passion for anything that was going on in my life. That is when I realized the reason why I get so depressed working a crappy job, because my life was already crappy from no passion.. then I went and smacked it in the face with a 30-40 hour tiring work week. I lacked passion about absolutely anything in my life. So, it was hard to get out of bed in the morning. I even had no drive to play my favorite video games because I thought it was pointless and a waste of time. I still played them, but I never really let myself enjoy them. That is when I realized that I need to find something that I am passionate about and make that my main goal in life. To always have passion about something. I took some time to think. I really thought about it.. I thought about all my experiences. What I liked and what I didn't like about them. I finally figured out what I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping people with a life problem. Whenever I can help someone with a really important problem. I just feel like something is lifted. I never thought to notice it before. I have always helped people all throughout my life. I helped my friends with their life problems instead of helping mine most times. I like it when I can make someone else's problem go away. It makes me happier knowing that they don't have to deal with that huge problem that they felt they needed my help on. 

That is why I want to help people find out what they are passionate about. I want to really dig deep into people's experiences like I did with mine and figure out what you enjoyed and did not enjoy about each aspect of your life/work/friends in order to find passion somewhere. I want to figure out what you're passionate about so that you can live a happier life and in return.. help me live a happier life. I believe finding out what your passionate about is what makes you truly feel happiness. With passion you don't care about what happens during the day. Because, you get to go home and really deeply enjoy this one thing that you love. Whether it be work or a hobby. Everyone can be passionate about something. 

I'm 27 years old now turning 28 late next year. If you have a similar problem and want help finding out what you're passionate about. Message me on Reddit or leave a comment down below and I'll message you. Like I said I have helped many of my friends with their problems and I would like to help anyone else that I can. This is what I am passionate about, so help me.. help you.

thanks for reading."
1582,I'm okay,"Trigger warning for self harm maybe. Sorry, it's a long post. And it's a lot of relationship stuff but it touched heavily on my mental issues so I hope this is an okay place to post it. These are my thoughts and I just want to share.

I suffer a bit from depression and a lot from anxiety, mostly social anxiety, and I have a lot of difficulty making new friends or getting new people who I grow to love to stay in my life. As a result, I literally only have two actual friends and my family to depend on. My family is kind of nutty sometimes. My mom and I are close and I think my sister and I get closer with every day that passes, but we have a bit of a complicated and painful history involving my grandmother and aunt which I will not go into.

Usually I'm alright and actually quite happy, or if not, I'm neutral or content (or maybe I've just gotten really good at ignoring when I'm mildly sad or unhappy). I don't struggle with loneliness much anymore; I think I've just learned to enjoy being alone a little bit. I do always crave love, though.

Since I've gotten myself to a better state after high school, I like to refer to myself as ""always living on the edge of depression, staring into the darkness but never falling in."" Well, this past year and 4 or so months I've fallen in quite a lot, due to drama with my boyfriend (now ex. Officially and for the last time). We really loved each other (I still love him), but due to his family being batshit crazy, we couldn't be together. We couldn't stay away from each other though, so we had a bit of an on and off relationship. Sometimes is was a mild ""we'll be friends but we can't see each other as often or be alone"", and other times it was an extreme ""we can't talk or see each other at all anymore"". Both ended with us finding our way back to each other, and they caused various levels of.... less than favourable moods for me. The latter was the last and most extreme one in which I became more depressed than I've ever been, because of the circumstances around our breakup and the fact that this man has become my best friend and who I loved so much, and now suddenly he's gone with no contact and I can't get out of bed or stop crying and at some point I started lightly self harming to see what it would feel like and whether I can go through with actually drawing blood and not just scratching my arm to shreds with scissors and the people I had met and thought were my friends weren't there for me when I needed them most and my mom and sister didn't know how to help me. I think it's the lowest I've ever fallen and darkest I've ever been. 

Oh, a notable detail. I don't see therapists cause they don't help me. Either we don't click or they can't see through the bullshit I pull up as a defense or I have trouble reaching them in which they give up on me, but nontheless they don't help. So I've learned to pull myself together when I need to.

Anyway, this time I couldn't pull myself together when I needed to the most. I didn't get better until I caved and messaged him again, and for fear of getting that low again, I asked him if we can just have a low key thing going on and try not to be too serious so that we can figure out how we really feel until we become independent and he doesn't need to listen to his family anymore (we're both in university and he's finishing his last year next year). I realise it's not healthy, but we went through with it and I don't know what he did but I did some intense soul searching the 4 or so months that it lasted. I let myself look at other guys and imagine life without him. I questioned every little quirk and asked myself if I REALLY wanted to live with it for the rest of my life. I let myself dwell on his imperfections. The answer to whether I wanted to live with it was always yes and thinking of moving on with someone else always hurt, but I let myself seriously consider it.

Ultimately, the choice was taken away from me, because last week he told me very carefully and gently that he isn't attracted to me anymore. Basically, what he wants has changed, or in his mind he moved on because of all of the hurt and complications we've had to go through. Point is, it is what it is and he doesn't want to be affectionate anymore. 

I... took it way better than I thought I would. I asked him for the last time if we can be friends, because the fact is that he is my best friend and I don't want to touch the darkness that goes with losing him again. He agreed and we agreed that there will be no more affection. And this time it's real. I can feel how real it is.

And I'm... okay? I cried a few times, of course. I picture him with another girl and I hurt. My pride is hurt. I feel a little unwanted and ugly. I'm craving a rebound. I miss him. 

But it's so unbelievably manageable that I'm shocked at myself. The darkness that I've been fearing isn't here (yet), and it feels how I think a normal breakup my age should feel like. It feels so completely liberating. And I'm okay.

Sorry for the long post but I wanted to try to share how I'm feeling and how much it means to me, and I can't go this deep into how low I've been anywhere else. Thank you for taking the time to read &lt;3"
1583,Daydreaming is my reality,"University semester is done, and I have no clue what to do. Tried going the teaching route, but I can't do it. I've got a job as a cashier at a convenience store and it's completely braindead. It gets me money, but zero satisfaction. I want to do something with my life, but I have no idea what. I have no ambitions, no interests that I can monetize, and I don't have any marketable skills. Scratch that, I don't really have any skills at all. I used to think I could be a writer, but I don't have the patience or drive for it. 

I've always loved daydreaming, but at this point it's the only thing I'm capable of. I used to make up storylines and characters and worlds - and I still do - but now I've gotten into a bad habit of picturing what I want my life to be. Getting to live a quiet life, in a small house, with someone I love, and with some kind of purpose. I don't care what kind of purpose, just something to look forward to. Sometimes I wonder if my personality is just incompatible with modern life, because the 9-to-5 would kill me. I can't stand social networking. I can't stand bureaucracy. I can't stand all the forms and paperwork life comes with. I just want it to be quiet."
1585,I thought I’d be happy but it made things...worse?! Now I can’t show my true feelings or I won’t achieve my dreams.,"In highschool I fell in love with a girl who was something I didn’t know. She constantly cheated on me constantly and lied to me all the time (such as saying she had cancer) and I believed her because I craved her affection and validation no matter how toxic it was. That sweet scent and soft touch blinded me from the long the long term effects of her lies and abuse. We were “tegether” for over 2 years and I skipped an entire semester and I lost every friend I had. Now I have one single friend who’s like an older brother. I managed to graduate by the skin of my teeth. Honestly my diploma was handed to me without me actually putting much effort in at all. 

I’m 20 and I have one dream and that’s to a sailor in the US Navy. I’ve been working with a nurse practitioner to regulate my medications (this is important). This N.P. Just so happens to be a corpsman (doctor) in the Navy reserve. She is willing to write a letter of recommendation that she has done for past clients who ended up joining the military. Only if I show progress though is she willing to do this. I’ve bounced from shitty job to shitty job and I’ve barely what you’d call progress. 

HERE WHERE DEPRESSION COMES INTO PLAY

I fart leaving my ex-girlfriend would fix all my problems but it just insinuated the loneliness I inevitably felt and every day I find myself laying in bed doing nothing I don’t know if it’s depression or if it’s a lack of motivation or a combination of both. I gained almost 40 pounds from that relationship so I’m horribly overweight by military standards and I’ve come to hate myself for letting myself go through that. 

I feel like I’m drowning but I can still breathe. It seems like nothing will change. I  Cancel all my parents to find out any of this or else it’ll set my progress but so far and I’ll be back at square one and I honestly don’t know if I’d be prepared to take that step even if it is the best step for me to take. 

After I broke up with my ex me and my parents got really close again and I’ve gotten to the point where I’m pretty much completely rely on them to survive even though I’m in my 20s now which is pathetic I’m terrified of losing them since they’re both about to hit 70 and I just want to make them proud but I feel like I’ll never do it I feel like I’m constantly letting everyone down.

I don’t know what this post is turned into I’m sorry if I’m over sharing I just needed a place to rant. I’m really sorry guys."
1586,I’m just so tired (a vent about nothing and everything),"I feel like saying I’m so tired is as close as I can get to describe what I’m feeling, it definitely feels more accurate than saying “I’m so sad” or “I’m so depressed”, yet it still doesn’t even begin to explain the emptiness and the mental and physical exhaustion I feel.

I feel so fucking stupid saying all this because I’m literally a 17 year old white guy who has a kind mother and food and a roof over my head and blah blah blah. I always see people saying like “oh don’t compare what you’re going through to what someone else is going through because it’s not a competition we’re all deserving of support” and whatever, and I totally agree, but like how can I NOT compare my struggles to other people’s struggles?? I’ve never even had a real fucking job before for Christ’s sake, I have NO IDEA how hard real life is. 

People have dealt with so much worse than this and I know I shouldn’t think that, but I do.

And it’s all I ever think. All I ever think is god you’re pathetic you don’t even deserve to feel sad, you’ve never even done anything hard in your life. Talking about “depression” like give me a break Jesus Christ..

Here’s another cool fact, I am SO behind in school. I stopped caring somewhere around grade 10 for some reason, yeah good idea let’s just decide to stop caring about school work lol let’s see where that gets you buddy...

The only friends I’ve ever had were in grade 4-5. And YES I mean that very literally. No I didn’t get  fake friends or anything like that, I mean literally no one, not one single friend from then until high school. 

Nobody’s fault but my own. I never fucking learned how to interact with people. I don’t know how to start a conversation, don’t know what to say, I don’t even know how friends act towards each other. I just never bothered because I figured friends weren’t important and I was doing everyone a favour by not trying to be friends with them, because I was sparing them from wasting time getting to know me.

When you get to high school everyone’s already in friend groups and shit and it’s like, why even bother? What do I have to offer these people? Nothing, absolutely nothing and I should just shut the fuck up and focus on my school work. They play sports or they like art or they play music, they actually do stuff and have stories to talk about. I don’t have any of that. I don’t do shit or have shit to say. I’m not unique in any way.

That was a really sucky time, when I had stopped caring about my school work. When I got good grades it just meant nothing to me, I didn’t feel any sense of accomplishment, I was never proud of myself despite my teachers telling me I should be, I was just like what the fuck is the point of any of this. I started skipping all my classes because I just couldn’t do anything anymore, it wasn’t even in the cool rebellious I don’t give a shit way it was like I skipped class but stayed in the school and just hid in the bathroom stalls and cried my eyes out until it was time to go home like a little loser boy.

If I was an emoji I would be this emoji 😐 that’s my personality. Actually even that mouth shows too much emotion.

😶 This is me, this is me as an emoji I am no mouth emoji nobody wants to be friends with no mouth emoji because he has no personality or emotion booo!

Things have been getting worse recently because it started off like, “oh I’m depressed but at least I got diagnosed with depression and yes I understand everything that is happening to me and why I feel this way and yes I still am in touch with my surroundings!”

But now it’s just like, ooooouuuuuggggghhhhh...

Thats the sound, that’s the only way I can describe this feeling to you. It’s like when you take a shower at 3 am and dissociate super hard, except it’s like... all the time, like you feel like that all the time even outside of the shower.

And at some point I think I walked out of that shower and I just never stopped feeling that way.

I don’t even feel alive anymore I just feel like I’m just some kind of ghost that’s controlling a body. Very poorly by the way. Like you know those funny indie games with the bad physics, the bad controls, that’s me that’s my body, I’m like hand simulator in real life.

This might be from weed but my whole life recently has just been a big derealization episode. (If you don’t know what derealization is, look that shit up it fucking sucks) That shit SUCKS (it sucks) and sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and just be like FUCK I’m sinking into the floor?????? And then I’ll go lock myself in the bathroom and breathe really heavy and cry and get scared I’m gonna have a heart attack and die because my heart is beating too fast.

I have the worst memory, the worst sleeping schedule, days will just pass like it’s nothing and I never know what time it is or what day it is. 

One minute I’ll be crying so hard I can barely breathe and the next I’m just laying down staring at the wall feeling empty and just totally emotionless until I fall asleep. 

This all sounds super edgy but that’s what’s been happening and it’s like, I don’t know, is this normal? Like I’ve dealt with dissociating before I’ve dealt with crying super hard but it’s gotten so intense these past few days that I’ve literally looked up HOW TO TELL IF UR LOSING YOUR SANITY at one point. Like lmao boy you’re just depressed not insane relax.

But I really do feel like I’m going insane sometimes.

This amount of isolation can’t be good for anyone.

Does anyone else fantasize about laying next to someone else? I’ll have entire conversations with a made up person in my head. Not a fleshed out person or anything, but more of just a human that’s blurry, no exact features or voice or personality, but it’s human shaped and that’s enough. It can be whatever I need it to be. 

Also just to clarify, I’m not crazy and I don’t have voices in my head or anything, I just mean in like an imaginary friend kind of way, except you’re grown up now and your imaginary friend isn’t a giant fluffy pink cat it’s just a normal human who cares about you. Cause I guess those things are too hard to get now so you gotta imagine one up. Kinda weird how it goes from being like a crazy made up creature to oh I just need someone to hold my hand and wipe my tears away now. Pretty sad.

When I’m crying my eyes out I imagine they’re holding me, and when I’m feeling lonely I imagine they’re holding my hand, and when I’m walking to my bus stop I imagine they’re walking next to me, and I talk in my head about the weather and imagine them answering, or my school work, and when I listen to my music playlist I pretend someone is in my seat next to me sharing my headphones (don’t actually do that it’s cute af but unsanitary af) and I’m thinking do they like this song? Do they like me? Can I hold their hand? Can I kiss them? 

I wanna hold a boy’s hand so bad like fuck why did they make boy’s hands look like that.

Anyways I’m getting off track sorry I’m just writing all of this after having a huge crying session and I just feel like getting all these thoughts out because if I don’t do this now I might never honestly.

And maybe someone else will relate to this, I don’t know. 

I just have a lot of feelings that I have no way to express. 

I’m so fucking tired."
1587,School is making me want to die,The classes I’m taking in college are so hard and the next two tests I take will make or break my grade. I feel so tired and I know it’s the end of the semester but I didn’t study properly and now I’m scared I’ll fail. I got into a nursing program and I’m happy about that but studying makes me want to just die.
1588,Grief doesn’t take a few days to heal,"Currently im struggling with grief this year, death of two people who were close to me.  Everyone is nice to me for about the 1-2 day I am in school they ask me if im okay and talk to me. 

Then its like a few days after the funeral is done, they continue to treat me like shit. Like im still mourning. Leave me alone, have some human decency. They pretend the stuff im going through is not happening in order to make themselves feel better. People don’t understand that despite it being a few days grief doesn’t take a few days to heal."
1589,Dad who struggles with depression due to stress.,"My wife just told me she was pregnant again. And honestly I'm terrified. Even more terrified than I was the first time. I've been living with my parents, well, on their property while I finished school. But when I finished my school I couldnt find a job that paid enough to support my family without giving up my family life entirely. It was bitterly disappointing as for 8 months of job searching every door was closed on me. In desperation I ended up sailing on tugboats and I make decent money now, but my 90 day eval is coming up and I dont know if they will keep me. This is a very ruthless industry where people aren't worth dirt. I'm terrified of losing my job and failing my wife and child. We have to move out of my parents property by the next coming month. I am not gonna go into details but we NEED to move out. I have about 10 grand saved up but I'm terrified I will lose my job and we will be screwed. How do I cope with all of this. I am just overwhelmed with hopeless feelings. I am the man, I am supposed to be strong for my wife but I go to bed shaking in a cold sweat every night worrying about what I should do. I went to college. I got my degree. It wasn't supposed to be this way, I just feel so hopeless and terrified that I will fail my family. That's it."
1590,This sub is the only place I can find comfort,I spend a lot of time on this subreddit because it’s the only place where I don’t feel so alone. I can try talking to other people in my life but it’s hard for them to help when they don’t truly understand what I’m going through.
1591,Im so nice to everyone yet get treated shit day in and day out,"Literally if I say anything I get judged and treated like shit. I told my mate to the same things I said 2 weeks after I said it and people were getting happy. When people steal the same jokes I make people laugh so much at it but its like...tf.

Like this might be petty on my side but theres certain girls in my school that comment hearts or compliment on every girl in our schools pictures on Instagram and (40 girls) and like mine its like none of the girls in my school bother to and its like they think I don’t notice but I do and it hurts."
1592,My first session with a psychologist and... hmmmmm,"I went to my first session with a psychologist earlier this week. It was a referral from my family doctor. I had spoken to a friend about this and they had said going to a therapist had been more beneficial to them. Wasn't 100% sure what they meant until I finished my session with the psychologist. 

First, I want to say this is in no way meant to slag on the psychologist or any such thing. The doctor was compassionate and I could tell he did care, but from this experience, I get the feeling that he's just there to diagnose and prescribe drugs, like as if I had a broken arm or some other straightforward physical ailment.

He diagnosed me with dysthymia and social anxiety. When I asked him how do we proceed from here at the end. One of the things he told me to try was to go meet people, like go to [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and find a meet up and don't worry about being uncomfortable. Then it was like see you in six weeks. 

A part of me was like really? I'm around people all the time, from forcing myself to pursue my interests, and for 75% of that time, I'm probably mildly to very uncomfortable. Been there. Done that. Got the bloody T-shirt. 

It seems that I should put my search for a therapist on the fast track.

Does anyone else have a similar experience? Am I over reacting to a first visit that maybe didn't go 100% perfectly?"
1593,I’m not who I should be,"I’m not like guys my age. I hate modern society. People say it’s just a phase and that high school is different and people but get better. But I can tell they don’t. The more I see, the more I realize that the world we live in is shallow, apathetic, and fake, built on terrible values and nearly zero morality. Those people out there who think they’re so great because they help people usually only help a select group of people because it matters to them. The guys I see are shallow just like that. Stupid, fake, baseless emotions and an insufferable, innate nature to be “cool.” Not valuing other people’s emotions and feelings. Not caring about making people happy. I don’t know if girls are like that too, but all I can say is I hope not. Nowadays I go out of my way to avoid looking “normal,” that is to say, to avoid looking like all those indifferent morons. I go out of my way to point my legs inwards to look unimposing and subdued. I intentionally shrink into myself around other people to stay as far out of their way as possible. I don’t want to be associated with that terrible apathy. But obviously that does nothing. It doesn’t make a difference how I act (not to anyone else and not to me). I wish people could see me for the caring, empathetic person I really am, and not just some quiet nobody. But then I have to ask myself- would anyone even care? Probably not. That’s the crushing, depressing truth. The world is cold and selfish. I don’t even hear those stories anymore, about a world where there is love and empathy, happiness and bonding. That’s not reality. Not even in my dreams have I witnessed a world like that. Every day I just want to stop the pain, but I can’t. I have no one to make me whole.
I was born into the wrong family. Different values, different morals, different personalities. I’m disgusted by the way my family treats me and acts, as if I’m just their friend for them to use for their own entertainment, or just a robot to do everything expected for this crazy, twisted image of “normal.” I have the wrong friends. Well, really, I have no friends. None of them are caring or form true bonds with others. But then again - why should they? They have a family to do that with. I was born into this terrible world where I don’t fit in. I’m an enigma here - and that WILL NOT CHANGE. I’m tired of people asking me to change MYSELF. I will not change my values and morals and beliefs and my identity just to be a part of this cold shell of a world. I don’t know how I happened to come into this world- but I want out. My mind is woefully different. Nobody understands my mentality: help people be happy. Surround yourself with love. People ACT like they understand that. They THINK they understand that. But they don’t. The truth is, they will only help others when there’s something in it for them. They will only care if they’re “in the right mood” or if they “feel like it.” It sickens me. Please take me out of this world. I’m not meant to be here. :("
1594,I can't stop thinking about the future.,"I can't sleep, bills only pile up. Maybe I will feel better one day but what happens if someone I know gets hurt or dies. What if my cat gets sick and we can't afford the medical bills. What if I crash my car again. Is there any solutions to these puzzles that plague my mind? I can't help but just lazily drink the day away in hopes the future will come soon, yet I'm ironically afraid of the future. The present is horrifying. I have terrible nightmares and usually am afraid to leave my phone for more than a few minutes. I am part of the void of the universe and I wonder if I even exist. Only a few people actually reach out to me and i scare them away with my negative thoughts. I feel bad about it but I can't stop thinking about sad things.

Also, I just got permenantly banned from /r/gaming and that bums me out a bit."

Then I get home I instantly like can only lay on my bed and stare at the ceiling for five hours. if it's a spicier day I cry a lot. Damn idk I just feel so numb nowadays. Like I'm a puppet at school"
1596,Is there a certain age where everything becomes clear?,"I'm 28 now, almost 29 and if anything my depression as only got worse over the years, I feel like I'm missing something, there's got to be something to fill that void ? How do I start to enjoy my life, instead of wasting the day away laying in bed and sleeping. I don't want to wake up in the morning, I'm always tired and nothing interests me any more, everything I once enjoyed is boring to me now, I can't even watch Netflix without turning it off half way through?

I've tried speaking to somebody and it didn't really help, I've tried medication, at least 7 different kinds and all they do is suppress my anger, give me side effects. 

I'm lost, and I see no other way out, it comes to us all, some people fear it and others wish for it."
1597,Scared to take my own life,The fact that there could be a hell out there for people who commit suicide is scary for me because when I do get round to taking my life I will be going to hell to endure more pain. Is there anyway out?? Please help

1603,I just dont know anymore,"Ok so i dont actually know if im depressed or not and tbh i can t be arsed seeing a professional about it. I don t even really want to talk about it bc i always think i should just get over whatever im dealing with. Its been a good 9/10 months I ve been feeling like nothing really matters anymore and i know people on here have been struggling for years and years so i always feel like i shouldn't feel the way im feeling. I just find nothing interesting or fun anymore, i play video games with friends or talk to them and ngl it's nice and everything but i hide these feeling and they don t even know. Sometimes i just wanna punch holes in my wall and lately thinking about things like self-harm (not to the point of suicide but still). I ve been thinking about trying pills but you cant get any without prescriptions. I just wanna suppress those feelings even if it means getting high everyday I don t care at this point. All of this because of a break up, can you even get depression from a break up? Everybody tells me it will get better but i just don t see it, sometimes i wish i didn't exist

Sorry if it's a bit all over the place and sorry for my english it's not my first language."
1604,A non interesting title,"Been diagnosed with depression for almost a year, pfft that's basically nothing
Been doubting the diagnosis ever since

Every day I wait for something to push me over the edge because I won't do anything by myself 
I'm weak and I always give up to pressure 
This post is a mess just like me 
What am I even talking about here 
Who would be interested in this
I should shut up, but I won't 
Is it because I want attention?
Is it because I seek approval?
What is wrong with me 
I hate myself so much 
It's be better if I'll disappear
I don't add anything to this world anyway 
When will it end"
1605,I wish I could just say “I’m feeling depressed” instead of constantly making excuses to explain why I act the way I do,Sometimes I am just too depressed to get out of bed or to meet up with friends. But just saying “I am depressed” is never a good enough excuse to people. It feels like they completely ignore what I say which forces me to come up with a “better” excuse like “Feeling sick today”. Just wish I could say “Feeling depressed” and have them say “okay” and leave me alone.
1606,Keep thinking about death and getting old. Will ssri help?,"Ive had depression for 10 years and been able to beat it here and there but it always comes back and when it does it gets stronger everytime. Im 20 now but something happened to me last year and im not sure what it was. I kept getting panic attacks at night, was so depressed i quit my job. It came back again but this time intensified i keep thinking im going to die soon idk why, and the thought of death keeps making me break down in tears and depressed the whole day no energy to do anything. Will a ssri help with this? ive tried therapy for about 20 weeks now and did nothing to me and tried 3 different therapists."
1607,I think I'm Fucked,"Here I am, at 20 years old, having accomplished nothing. From my early childhood, high expectations have been placed upon me by my parents, peers and teachers. None of those set expectations for me did I realize. I dropped out of college, became addicted to drugs and work at a grocery store. I missed out on meaningful relationships in my teens. I have no ambition. I can hardly get out of bed anymore. I've stopped going to the gym.  I wish every day that I was dead."
1608,Drawing no cutting,I’ve started drawing on myself or in my sketch book recently whenever I get super anxious or depressed. Idk it sounds weird but it helps
1609,Argument with parents/not sure what to do,"I honestly can be horrible to my parents saying profanities and disrespecting them all the time when we get into arguments and it happened today. Later on my mother said something about when I admitted my depression about a week ago and about how I was crying. Upon reflection she wasn't mocking mw and I felt mocked. I'm not proud of this but I pushed her, nothing crazy but I was enraged.  I'm really scared of myself to be honest. I grabbed these glass things and started smashing them and I was in like a fit. My dad grabbed me and restrained me but it was crushing me and I could breathe and my mother pulled my hair which she later apologised but said I was trying it hurt my dad which I was. I feel like a psycho... I hate my life and the only thing I live for is the fact that everyone would remember me as a maniac if I was gone. Writing this out I feel like if in the wrong... if this post gets any traction I'll answer questions.

Don't worry I'm not in danger  I'm the problem but the hotline wouldn't pick up and I need someone to talk to.
I don't want to see a therapist but I sound insane"
1610,I’m tired of even trying I give up fuck everyone,Everyone pushes me away I feel like I’m tired of feeling rejected I don’t care anymore I don’t fucking care about anything I could die tonight don’t care never get a job or have money don’t fuckin care no girlfriend fuck em
1611,I'm so done,"I'm sick of feeling like I'm dating a stubborn child that accuses me of shit then runs away instead of fixing things. I already feel like shit and hating this month so much already. I don't want to have a negligent ""boyfriend"" on top of it all. I already feel single and I shouldn't feel it because I'm supposed to be in a 5 month long relationship and be on top of the world.

Instead I'm blocked and ignored, called names and accused of shit I'm not even doing. And get told I'm having a go at them when I'm trying to get him to communicate with me, because communication is fucking key in a relationship. Communication and trust. And I feel like I have neither because he says shit like ""this is why I don't talk to you"" when I try to talk to him.

I'm fucking done. I'm sick of babysitting or trying to talk to him when he is clearly content with never talking to me again.."
1612,Anyone in this subreddit not depressed willing to talk,Inbox me please
1613,Oh Alcohol...........,"I've never been a heavy drinker, well I drink more since I moved to Germany. I almost cried for couple of times today, when working and when I attended lecture. I dragged my self today to attend a Christmas party, at first I always being the weird guy who sit in the corner and observe ""those happy-functioning-people"". I hate to say it but after few glasses of wine my mood was elevated. Why can't I resist alcohol to have some fun? I've said to my self to take easy on alcohol because I got breakdowns after I drink alcohol. I guess I'm just weak, pathetic with no self control."
1614,Depression and sex.,"I want to start by saying I have some other mental health issues that might be what is the course of this but maybe not I don't know.

But does anyone else get EXTREMELY depressed after sex? I've been talking to a guy for some time and we had sex tonight. He is someone I am extremely interested in and I wouldn't mind or be angry if he was my boyfriend.. However when I left and was on my way home I just felt like complete shit and I just wanted to end my life. This has happened before when I had a 1 night stand with a guy and I assumed maybe it's coz I wasn't really that into him and I was just disgusted with myself but no I felt the same tonight. I can't describe it, I feel repulsive, worthless and good for absolutely nothing... I wanna stress it was NOTHING the guy said or did, he is absolutely amazing, aware of my situation and is really good and informed. I wish I could explain exactly what is going on but I don't have a clue.. I just break down, hate myself immensely and have to try my hardest not to throw myself in traffic. I called my parents to take me home which they did(not knowing I had sex but that's irrelevant). Does anyone else get like this?"
1615,At what age should someone be able to live on their own?,"I'm almost 24, live with my parents and believe me if I say that I wouldn't survive alone. I don't know how to wash clothes or how to cook. If my dad wouldn't prepare food for me when I come home from work, I'd completely stop eating (happened once). I was overwhelmed with simply paying a bill once and would quickly get drown by all these duties.

Most important reason why I don't move out is that I simply don't know how that's done. I don't know how to look for an apartment and don't know how to get my stuff there. I don't even have any idea on how I'd get any furnitures into there, nor I know how and where to buy them.

I'm completely helpless and feel like a failure as people at my age start their own life."
1616,I really need a hug,I'm not doing so well and could really use a hug or preferably even sone cuddles
1617,Me and my ex are working things out,We don't always get along but we're gonna try to have more open communication and not fight as much. To be honest I've never met a girl that loves me as much as her. It makes me feel like I have a purpose here. Another reason to keep living.
1618,Does my trauma still affect relations with people?,"A few years ago I started inviting people/friends into my appartement and we were hanging around having a good time. But the interest always came from my side, they never actually invited me or smth. But it took time to realize this. When I actually did, I didnt understand the world and people anymore, I started thinking about all my relationships and so on. This was the beginning of my 'process of self-development' which I am very happy with and thankful that I met those people. This is what I would call my 'trauma', because I believe it somehow affects my relationships today and how I interact with people. In general I am an extrovert 90% of the time, but in school I also had not many people to spend time with, it was easy for me talk to everybody about some bullshit but not stuff which is relevant in a relationship. Today I still struggle with friendships, because I cant tell who is a friend and who is not, maybe because I dont have a long lasting friendship. And all this self-development sometimes makes me think that this is not the real me. All these problems make me cold blooded, I am very calm and hard on the outside but I think on the inside I am a broken glass. In addition to all this I often feel that I am not in the right place or the 5th wheel on the car. I know this text is full of mistakes, because english is not my native language and maybe my idea isnt clear, but I just wanted to write down all this, cause I think I am going crazy sometimes. There are times when I dont think about all this, but right know it all comes to my mind."
1619,Decided to start recovery [x post to r/congratsimlikefive],"Decided to start recovering from depression

[tw: depression, suicidal thoughts, abuse]

So, I’ve decided to really start digging deep and going through a thorough recovery from my depression and trauma from 17 years of childhood abuse. I recently had a wake up call (I failed over half of my classes this semester despite loving school and used to be a straight A student before I became majorly depressed in 2016), and I will have to medically withdraw, or else lose my scholarship to an amazing school. I love it here, and I love the community I have here, and I’m tired of rolling over and being a slave to my depression. It’s my life, and I’m taking it back in my hands. 

I have to convince my therapist to sign my medical withdraw and medical re-enrollment forms, but after talking with some friends, I’ve got a success plan and a whole team of awesome people there to help support me and hold me accountable. They all will have access to my Google calendar, so I can’t hide behind the excuses and lies I would give to justify staying alone in bed all day. 

This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I don’t remember what it means to be truly happy, but I am determined to find that again. I’m determined to graduate from college, because I know there’s much more planned for my life than just being miserable all day. I’ve been in therapy for over a year, and on meds for almost a year, but there’s been not much of a change except not wanting to die as much. So, it’s time for me to take my life back. This will be the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but I’ve got this!"
1620,It's been a month...,"My mother died one month ago yesterday. Tomorrow is her birthday. I know with her passing it will be the end of my family. You see when my grandmother passed away her children went their separate ways. My mother did not wish for that to be the case. She was always getting in touch with her siblings. Trying for that connection. I know she would not wish that for her own children but the way my siblings are I know this may turn out to be the case. Aside from my eldest sister who was there to help my mother raise me until she turned 18. I am not sad by this. I am however devastated at the loss of my mother. I am the youngest by 12,14 and 16 yrs. So I was given the least amount of time with her. And as each day goes by it only seems to get worse."

1622,Please allow me to rant.,"Yesterday, my mom and sister took me to dinner to catch up with each other. I wanted to take that opportunity to open up to them about my recent struggles with self-harm and negative thoughts. It has been bad. Long story short, the severity of these thoughts outweigh any positivity I have left in me. I've sought help and currently doing frequent appointments with my doctor. I think it's a start and I cannot wait to finally overcome this ordeal. 

Please allow me to rant regarding the dismissive attitude of my sister toward this illness. All I wanted was to tell them. I was not expecting any form of help, no advice, nothing. Just the fact that I seriously thought I was going to at least feel better even for that just 2 hours we were out to dinner but surprisingly, I didn't. 

My sister had it to a point to bluntly tell me that I am being coddled. That all these feelings are just feelings and it's not as deadly as cancer. That all I have to do is as simple as thinking positively. She was dismissive, and completely downplayed everything I've opened up about. I could tolerate that maybe she does not care, but all she had to was to *believe* me. I wake up every single day with zero motivation, no zest and the desire to give up my dog to someone else then harm myself is strong.  

I am extremely angry and frustrated at her until now. I accept that people have different opinions but all I ever wanted was them to not solve this crisis for me, but for them to just *listen.* They've asked me a few times about this and come the time I told them, I was met with, not an extreme reaction but an unwelcoming response, nonetheless. I wish I could just describe what I think and feel every single day into words but it's tedious. The only reason why I do not open up to my friends and family about this is I do not want to put a damper on anyone else's day. This whole ordeal is so negative I fear people are going to stay away from me once aware of my situation. 

I don't expect anyone listening to me to act like my psychologist, but I just wanted someone to listen to me. My sister's attitude has completely crushed my hope and faith in my healing."
1623,"My brother has depression and anxiety, need advice.","My brothers suffers from anxiety and depression. On a good day he’ll be up at 10 but usually he sleeps till 2, rarely goes to work and has never articulated any interesting moving out of our parents house or starting a life. The fact that my father is his only support system and is getting on in years has caused a lot of friction. 

The situation is made more miserable by the fact that he’s 6.5 and 250lbs and gets extremely anxious when you bring any of this up, Though he’s stopped drinking, in the past, he has drunkenly threatened me with violence over extremely inane things. 

I have theory that do to his weight his problems are related to sleep apnea. He snores a lot and it sounds weird. But he insists that he doesn’t have it. He doesn’t go to therapy and I can see the stress it causes my parents, any advice, incite, tips?"
1624,It’s getting worse.,"I’m beginning to resent the only person who MIGHT give a shit about me other than my folks, my girlfriend. She has no emotions, doesn’t really know how to show me love, and it’s hopping on top of my existing feelings and multiplying it and making me hate her. It’s consuming me. I don’t know how long I can deal."
1625,moving on,"I do not have a close relationship with most of my immediate family. my father was physically and emotionally abusive growing up, and I felt abandoned by a mother who stood idly by and siblings I just never felt included by. 

as I've been finally starting to fight my depression rather than completely succumbing to it, I've been putting a lot of effort into repairing our relationships. 

however, it keeps becoming vividly clear to me that we will never be close, that they still suck in some pretty big ways, and that I will always feel like an Outsider among my own family. 

I know it isn't really my fault, and I don't think there's much more I can do but- how do I let them go? how do I make it ok for us to just...not be close..at all?"
1626,Why do people keep trying to make me feel guilty about having depression?,I didn’t choose to be depressed. Calling me ungrateful isn’t helping me.
1628,"Plan tonight -- drink a whole bottle of wine, smoke weed, cut myself, binge eat, cry, take sleeping pills, pass out on the couch",Wake up tomorrow and lay in bed until the night and then do it alllllll over again. This is the same thing every day. My life now. The only things keeping me from full on killing myself
1629,Gaming makes my depression worse,"Most days I sit at home playing video games. I never even go out with friends, I have no motivation to. I don't even have fun playing games anyone, I just feel empty doing anything now. I don't even have any friends to play with, so I could be alone for days at a time. I also get bullied by people online for being female, so that just makes the situation worse. Its all saddening, I wish I could be happy."

1631,Depression and Fitness Cycle,"Hi y’all,

M/27
I am posting to see if you guys have any experience with this. I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts my whole life. I’ve recently been in a rather rough patch and haven’t been working out much (Twice in the last ten days). This creates a bad cycle where I am too depressed to workout, and then depressed I didn’t workout. Do you guys have any methods where you use to get into the gym during these times?"
1632,Entry-level Jobs where you don't have to be pretend that you're not depressed?,"I feel like almost every job description is looking for someone ""bubbly"". I need to go back to school for something but for *now*, I desperately need out of the retail/food industry. First suggestion off the top of your head?"
1633,I feel as if I’m overreacting.. (apologies for the long read),"I don’t expect you to read all of this, but if you do, thanks I guess. A few years ago I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder), GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and insomnia. I am now also diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 and PTSD. 

My childhood is as pretty normal. My dad worked and my mom was a stay at home mom. We also had food and toys, and my parents never abused me and brother. 

When I was 14 I met this girl and fell in love with her. From 15-18 we dated off and on. I should clarify at this moment that I myself am female and dating her shook up my entire world. It caused a lot of inter personal conflicts as I was raised Baptist. She was so sweet and caring in the beginning but over time she started drinking and doing hard drugs. She became very verbally and emotionally abusive. When all of this was happening, I hadn’t came out to anyone out of fear because I had seen how friends close to me had been treated by their parents and the community for who they were. So while this was happening, I didn’t tell anyone and just tried to suppress it. 

While all of this was happening, my dad was having an affair. He was moving in and out to live  with his girlfriend (a very abusive woman in many ways) or my mother. My mother refused to leave him based on her religion (that you shouldn’t get a divorce and God will fix everything if you pray hard enough). On multiple occasions my father told me the reason he was leaving my family was because of me. He told me I caused him too much stress (I had a suicide attempt that sent me to the hospital when I was 16) and that I was too much like my mother for him to like me. 

At this point I’m 18. My girlfriend leaves me for another girl who she does heroin with (we cut any and all contact) and I’m lost. I move out and into college. A few months after starting school, she calls me and tells me she tried to kill herself. She didn’t know what to do and I talked to her for a few days to calm her down and make sure she got proper hospital care. Then she left again. Flash forward about 2 months, she calls me again. She said she broke up with her girlfriend and she loves me. She made so many promises she had changed and she was getting off hard drugs and she would work on our relationship like she should have from the beginning. It was all things I had heard before, but this time I actually believed her. Flash forward 3 more weeks. She tells me just being around me makes her feel immense amounts of guilt. She tells me that she notices the slight personally differences, the slight ways I talk, the slight ways I present myself, the slight changes in me that resulted from years of abuse. She tells me that seeing that made her want to kill herself over what she did and she was never going to talk to me again. Again, I’m absolutely heartbroken. I’m angry at her, I’m angry at myself for believing her. 

Two weeks later she sends me a letter (I had blocked her on every form of media). She told me she loves me and there was stuff she wanted to say, but it would have to wait until another time. She sent me some small personal stuff (including a necklace she got me for Valentine’s Day). I was even more angry that she was trying to do this to me all over again. So, I emailed her. I told her that she didn’t just get to come and go in my life like that like she pleased. I told her this was it, this was the end, that she was to never contact me again. Then I changed my address so she couldn’t mail me anything and refused to let anyone who knew her know where I lived. I don’t really think I meant it though. I think I expected her to come back into my life and for us to be happy. 

A week later someone contacted me. She had committed suicide. 

It’s been a few months now, but I still feel as though it happened yesterday. I miss her like crazy and I don’t know what to do. Honestly, it’s been over a year since she left me for the other girl so I feel as though I should be much further past it. I feel like I’m overreacting about everything that’s happening. I feel like it’s hard too hard to get out of bed most days and I can’t concentrate on anything. I know people who go through so much more and I feel so guilty for being sad. Everyone seems to have moved on and I seem to be trapped. Multiple friends of mine have told me I need to be over it by now and I shouldn’t have been sad to begin with. I had a happy childhood, and I do well in school, I have a job. My family tells me theres nothing to be sad about and maybe I just believe them a bit. So many more people go through greater things and here I am making myself sad over something that happened a long time ago. 

Anyway, thank you for the read."
1634,Is this all my fault?,"I know my mom tries to understand what my depression feels like but, tonight, I think I crossed a line. I sent her this text: 'You don't have to pretend to care anymore. Nothing won't change and we'll continue this cycle until I move out. I'll start to commit suicide but I'll pussy out until the last second, you'll say that you're busy only to call and say that that's for crazy people and I'm not crazy, dad won't say anything and I'll be stuck in this house and repeat the same routine until something sets me off again. I won't try to commit suicide anymore because it's not worth it. Not because I care about my insignificant life but because I'm afraid of pain. But whatever, I'll just roll with the punches until god decides to put me out of my misery like the old dog I am'

I do feel like this and I didn't mean to place all the blame on her, I was just so upset and hopeless before and I sent this in a fit of anger but it feels like we go through the same routine and it'll only stagnate as life goes on. Not to mention I live with a drug addicted verbally abusive grandmother and my sister and I don't have the best relationship, along with my father so my mom is the only person I have left. 

I can't lose my mom because of my depression, I'm scared to be alone but, she won't talk to me and I was being an asshole to her. I'm so scared..."
1636,The only point in life is to pass on your existential dread to the next generation,"Just came back home from my 3rd semester of college, where I’ve been absolutely miserable. I’ve noticed that my parents spend all their time doing exactly what I have since high school: go to work, do chores, and spend all remaining free time watching TV. What else is there to experience? I’m supposed to be in “the best part of my life,” but I can feel my youth slipping away and there’s nothing left for me to look forward to. What’s even the point?"
1637,You ever just try to sleep but miss being important to somebody? Me rn,
1638,does anyone feel like they have the flu when they’re depressed?,"I feel like I keep a good mindset. I’m not sad all of the time but i always feel terrible. Like my body hurts, i’m always tired, i get really lightheaded all of the time and i’ve been having bad stomach issues for months. The thing is I also have really bad anxiety that keeps me isolated at home which isn’t normal for me. I know my brain isn’t working but it’s so frustrating feeling like all of the physical experiences like becoming intolerant to gluten and dairy and not being able to eat normally for a month is all caused by IBS. Would love your perspective."
1639,Can anyone help me- my friend is in desperate need of it,"Hi, my friend is really going through shit right now and I don’t know what to do.

He’s had problems since I’ve known him in secondary school, but they’ve got exponentially worse in the past month or so. With an overwhelming sadness and hatred of himself, college work, and inability to want to get help himself, everything is getting worse for him. I’ve  tried many many times to make him get help, ringing the NSPCC, saying he’ll go with him to the GP etc, but all he says is “it won’t help” or “it’ll get better in time”, which it hasn’t at all. His complete disregard for his own mental well-being is very worrying, as he’s also started self harming a lot more. He used to do it before but only when things got very tough, but now it’s progressed up his arm and every time I see him there are new cut marks. He acts very defeatist and like he can’t go on, which makes me utterly saddened as all I want is for him to get better This leads me to feel very concerned for his safety, as he is progressively making more “jokes” about committing suicide. His complete inability to be able to pursue help on his own leads me to think that he won’t be able to get help without someone else doing it for him, what can I do, all I want is for him to get better, but he refuses to."
1640,Do you guys ever wonder how others would react if you died?,"I know people would notice, but would they care? How would people react to my death?"
1641,What Is love?,"I am 23 and i don't know what Is love. My mom killed herself when I was a child I don't want to use It as an execuse of my failure but It has Just been so difficult to get throught this.
I've always preferred to stay alone and now i don't know how to make friends, I am Just so sad."
1642,.,"I pretended to be sick so i can skip school and didnt wanna socialize and it feels like I'm an burden who radiates negativity and who isn't really fun to be around with.

Feels like I'm getting judged no matter what I do and when I hear people laugh it feels like its toward me and so I get even more quiet and tired  and when I'm actually having fun it quickly fades.

It feels selfish because there's people out there suffering and grieving whilst I'm here sulking and being kinda mean for no reason and whom isn't gonna amount to much ."
1643,I feel totally worthless.,"I feel like my emotions and feelings are totally invalid bc my parents keep dismissing me. I tried to get help and get a doctor or see someone or literally anything and my parents will not budge. The only time they even considered it for me, they heckled me relentlessly until I just gave up and said nevermind. I can't win against them and I hate it."
1644,Unbelievably tired.,"Pretty much the title: every day i wake up realize how little power i have left in me to fight andabout my day like a walking corpse, a vacuum void of all passion."
1645,Motivation is becoming a real problem...,"EDIT: I just realized how much I posted. I am sorry if it comes off as simply venting. And if you read the whole thing... well... thanks I guess.

__________________

I am a 35-year-old male in the Washington DC area who has spent most of his life dealing with depression. I tend to think it started at the end of elementary school when I began to be bullied by a new student. The bullying continued through middle and early high school but with different characters. I spent most of my school years hiding within a shell, putting on a mask to hide who I really was on a daily basis and simply trying to move forward. I had friends, but not many. I had goals, but vague ones. I was an introverted and shy individual who could still be a social butterfly if just put in the right situation with folks I was comfortable with. I flailed about towards the end of my teen years and then eventually bailed on college to start working.

Fast forward about 10 years. After 10 years of dead-end jobs (well only 3 total in that time), I decided it was time for a change. Enough was enough. I give all credit to this change to both my rediscovery of my creative side (beginning to paint and draw) and to my parents who took me back in to help me save and gave me the gift of classes at a community college. I began creating art again, which I had loved as a child but had left behind for some reason. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with an Associates' degree in Fine Arts in 2 years. I was dating a classmate who I loved and who loved me back. I was getting my life together. I got a job in marketing making decent money and began attending school at a traditional college to get a Bachelor's degree and getting straight A's. In my free time, I continued painting and drawing and was showing work at local restaurants and selling online.

My life was finally looking up, and my struggles with depression and motivation seemed to be behind me. I was just a ""slow-bloomer"" folks would say. I would nod politely but in private think that it was likely just art and creativity providing me an outlet to keep the depression at bay. A therapy of sorts.

_____________

Then within the span of a few years, it all went to shit. 

My girlfriend broke it off. Not because she really wanted to but because her parents did not approve of me as a match for their daughter. They wanted someone of a similar cultural and religious background, and someone who was closer in age (we were 8 years apart) and that was not me. She respected them too much and could not choose between me and her family. I don't hate her for it but it hurt me.

I lost my marketing job. To be fair, I basically quit due to concerns about both the health of the company and in protest with other employees over the way they were treating women. My reasoning for quitting was proven right in the long term with the company having issues, and the local office being closed within a year. I also had been having health issues. But then I struggled to find another job before finally just picking up a retail position for the time being.

And then, as if to kick me when I was down, I was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Stage IV. Non-curable. I had been feeling bad for several years, and it probably did not help with other elements of my life. After the diagnosis, I was forced to quit my job and put school on hold while undergoing emergency treatments to stabilize my situation. I then became classified as disabled due to the side effects of both the tumors and treatments. Consistent fatigue, nausea, and other less pleasant elements complicate my life.  I have managed to continue school when I can, but the hope of graduating in 2 years, has now turned into a 4-year slog with several more to go due to limitations and needing time off for surgeries.

So here I am, a long-term cancer patient without hope of a cure. No job and even if I find one I would be limited in what I could do and how much I could work. No girlfriend with the prospects of finding one being quite bleak, despite my best efforts to put on a brave face and put myself out there on dating apps and occasionally out in the world. I mean, who wants to date a cancer patient with no end in sight? Who wants to take a shot on someone who has restrictions and health concerns. And of course... school dragging on.

I am stuck. Stuck in an endless loop of surgeries, treatments, and self-pity. I have such little motivation to go out and do anything, and complicating it all is the consistent fatigue I feel. I am constantly lonely and longing for a significant other. I have almost no close friends left, in part because I am so introverted, and my previous ones have busy lives or have moved on. I live with my parents because of my situation and while I love them to death, the idea of it embarrasses and frustrates me. I can't even find the motivation to paint or draw or write or do any of the creative endeavors that had brought me out of the darkness the first time around. When not in a class, I simply watch TV, play a video game, or read a book. Looking for an easy mental stimulation and a minimal effort mental escape where I can forget myself.

I sit here, hoping some wonderful woman will think I am interesting, decide to give me a shot and kick my ass into gear and make me want to be a better person for them. Or perhaps some art patron will see my work, love it, share it with the world, and make me excited to explore new things. But until then, I just sink further into quicksand, because I simply can't motivate myself to do anything!

I got out of a spiral once before, but this one feels much worse in large part due to the nature of an incurable cancer that may very well shorten my life. I feel angry at the cancer for not just killing me if it was not going to be curable. I feel angry at myself for feeling that way when others with cancer would give ANYTHING to have more time with their loved ones. And of course tremendous guilt as well.

I am a good, sweet, shy person with a good heart. I am a Hufflepuff. I am not terrible looking. I am not suicidal (although I have been feeling as if I may be creeping closer). But I am introverted and seemingly lacking the ability to motivate myself these days. I can work hard with the right motivation. I have potential.

But I am stuck. I AM STUCK. WHY CAN'T I MOTIVATE MYSELF!

1646,I feel like my life is slowly being wasted,"Lurker on my main account but finally feeling the need to post and vent. I’m almost 30, no college education, no driver’s license, and I’ve had one job my entire life. It’s mind numbingly boring and I basically work alone so it’s also isolating. I have ambitions, passions, and so many dreams but I feel like I’m just stuck and I don’t know how to move forward. My spouse is the only person I ever interact with and anyone else I love is hours away and no one ever reaches out to me, it’s always me doing the reaching. I would love to make new friends but my town is small and the only places to meet people is bars and I do not want to re-enter that scene. I just feel so lonely.

I’d give anything to get back the sense of wonder and excitement for life that I used to have, and I can’t stand that I have zero interest in hobbies that used to be essential to me. Although I’m depressed I’m not suicidal (maybe passively?) and I’m terrified to die. I’m so scared of this feeling lasting for another few decades and realizing I really did waste my life. I can’t continue this same mundane routine day after day, wake up, eat, play the same video games, do housework, sleep, go to work the next day, repeat. 

Trying to get into therapy soon and the goal is to at least get enough motivation back to start making positive changes in my life but damn I’m  nervous."
1647,I dont know?,I’m ginger suffer from lots of bullying am pretty anti social and I thought of ending it all once. I probably would have cut myself but never have anything to do it with. I sound pathetic.
1648,Feel like I might jump in front of the train on my 30th birthday,"Trying to psyche myself up a little bit. I don’t actually want to die- what I *actually* want is... a car, a girlfriend, a cat, friends.... but that stuff seems impossible to acquire. 

I currently spend all day every day alone in a room, I mean I feel like a natural extrovert living in solitary confinement. I could go to the library, but I don’t want to spend $5 of my $20 net worth just to take the bus there so instead I stay home and live inside the internet.

Anyway. Yeah. I don’t feel committed but I wish something would push me over the edge. I wish something bad enough would happen this week so I could just feel like yeah, I’m ready to die."
1649,I just got blocked,"I managed to get blocked by the only person that I truly felt I have, because I'm an idiot. 

I mean, I still have one friend and my family, but I feel like they're so distant from me, that I don't feel I ""have"" them, you know? My family doesn't even know that I'm depressed.

I get blocked like two days ago, and I feel completely lonely now. Things were already so difficult, and now I just screw up and made everything worse.

I think even if I get unblocked, I will just isolate myself and that's it. I'm feeling like a piece of shit right now, and don't want to hurt anyone else. I don't deserve to have anyone else."
1650,Why cant I trust my own family and friends?,I have been struggling with my mental health for about a year and a bit now and I have never told anyone but my ex and she just said it will pass. It has been 2 months since she said that and if anything it has gotten worse.
1651,My depressed girlfriend (18) me (19),"Hi there, Im not sure if this fits in here.
If not then feel free to take this down.

So Im here to het my story of my chest, and hopefully get some advice.

So my now girlfriend and I are very in love. We've got so much in common, things like music, hobbies etc. Except for one thing. She used to/ still is depressed. Its hard to tell which one it is. 

I know its weird to say those three words so soon. But to be honest, its what I feel. I love her. But de depression thing is holding us back. She knows it, and it really upsets her. 

She told me that her ex boyfriend, Lets call him Jack A** or JA for short, used to abuse her. And force her in to doing things. This left a scar. Metaphorical as well as a real one. She has cuts all over her arms, parts of her legs and feet.

Im not judging her and she is comfortable wearing short  shirts around me. I really care about her wellbeing. And I dont want her to hurt herself anymore.

She is getting in to therapie somewhere in the next month or two. Which is good.

I dont blame her, im always there for her, I tell her that everyday. 
The one I blame is JA. Im not here to brag about it but im currently practising marital arts. And all I can think of is kicking JA's teeth in.

Yes this turned dark really quick. But Im just angry and upset all the time. And really dont know what to do. I love her and im not planning on leaving her any time soon. But the mixed feelings overwhelm me sometimes.

I came here to get this of my chest and maybe get some advice.

Like I said, if this is in appropriate feel free to take this down.

Oh btw, im not English nor American so sorry for any badly articulated words."
1652,Does anyone else constantly hit themselves?,"I constantly hit my head in a feeble attempt to stop the thought. I slap myself when I'm angry and hurt. I punch my cheeks, scratch myself, Hit head to walls and objects, Bite fingers, Pull hair etc,,like really I do one of those things every 5 minutes or something. I hate myself and existence so badly."
1653,I cant even take a simple vacation without it going to hell,"My cousin invited me to go to New York City with him for a couple days this weekend. I thought it would be the perfect thing to cheer me up despite the fact I couldn't quite afford to do much on the trip. The bus ride down was awful since the seats were too small and the driver refused to turn the heat down so we were all basically cooking inside this bus that took a few hours longer than it was supposed to to get there. My cousin forgets that not everybody can walk long distances like he can so we had to walk the whole way to the hotel in pouring rain because of his stubbornness. The hotel was too hot, the AC didnt work and the windows only opened 6 inches. Times square and the areas surrounding it are absolutely trash. Every inch of that part of the city has some freak trying to steal your money. If not that, every single thing in that area is designed to cost everyone money. Nothing that goes on in that place is for the betterment of humanity. It's all specifically to make some Corporations money one way or another. I couldn't enjoy much because there were dangerously thick crowds on every inch of the city. Rockefeller center with the ice rink and tree was even worse because you couldn't stand in one spot for more than a second without getting shoved into by some dipshit. I missed a public marriage proposal that happened a few feet away, which witnessing one of those in person is one of the few things on my bucket list so that stung a lot. My cousin just had to go up the empire state building and just had to have the express ticket so that cost a fortune, and it was super overcrowded, so not worth the money. They didnt even sell the lego set they advertised. All in all my legs are practically broken, and I've returned home hundreds of dollars poorer and much more depressed than I was before the trip."
1654,"When you said that I ""deserved better"". I wish I took those words to heart sooner than later because",What you were saying was really the truth. I do deserve better. Better than what I had before with you. You brought me down but now I'm stronger than ever and forever be the regret you will harbor forever
1655,"How I fight it, and how I'm winning.","First of all, I'll try my best to be clear altough 1st, english is not my main language; 2nd I'm not a person who has the ambition to help others trough this, I'll be doing it as an exercise and if by chance this actually reaches and relates to someone then that is great. This is more of a way to organize my thoughts and perhaps seek further advice.

With that out of the way, I wish to share with you my thoughts and experience with depression and what I find useful and what I don't, this may and does change from person to person.

We won't be going trough my life and my issues we are headed for the solution, but I guess there should be a summary of how I got to know more about this topic.

My first relation with depression came at a young age, with my mother. She had me really young and not really accomplished, and had severe depression. She did prevail and achieved many great things later in life, I can't complain about growing up, I did have an overall good childhood, may not have been a happy one but that was not anyone's fault but mine, I was a troublesome kid that was very alone, obviously I did not know better too at the time at that is the first thing I wan't to point out, and it may be as well the most important one for it's the starting point.

Some people live in guilt during their whole existance, this is the first thing we must fight off otherwise it stops us right there, at the first floor. How do I do it? When you first recognize that you did not have **it** in you, it starts to slow you down less trough time and I mean, it takes time, and effort. It's trough realization that you were weak and had to come all this way to learn about your weakness you realize that above all else, you are in your place, exactly where you should be because you are that person, the way we deal with things do in most cases determine our future status.

Done with that? Not quite I bet, but it gets better. Before I was way older I did not understand depression or recognized it as a real, because you can't spot it, it doesn't get you sick and vomiting or with fever, doesn't hurt or heal like a broken bone, this led me back then to believing that it was just a drama fueled failure in our way of thinking, that things were not clear and you yourself was causing it, well sometimes it could be like that and it certanly can be, but it's not only that. Part of it comes from weakness, human weakness, I have it, you have it.

Depression is not weakness, it is weakness that lead you to it. For example if a loved one dies and you were not around them as much as you think you should, you did not treat them as you think you should or simply did not enjoy your time with them as you should've. You get swallowed by the feeling of depression, you will feel ungrateful, angry, sad, you will succumb to your guilty thoughts and at that point, what you failed to realize is that no matter what, to continue we just have to deal with, some do it better than others no doubt but it is part of everyone's life and SO is depression.

Take envy as an example, you have to deal with it, everyone does at some point in time. For me it works in two ways, you either felt it in the past and realized it, fought against it and slowly turned it in some other thing, using it as inspiration, ambition (WAY healthier) or by just simply shutting it down and silencing it. Or you are still in that process, you feel angry, ungrateful, and you are going crazy about other people's realizations when in reality, you are just slowing yourself down. Also, the longer you take to fight it the more of a habit it becomes and harder it is to realize what you should be doing instead, the brain is a muscle, it demands maintenance, working it out. Depression is no different here, if you want to move forward you WILL have to fucking chew it and fight it.

Work your brain, stop doing whatever makes you weak, or distracted from the struggle, face it. Go out there, because in here is the same old misery we are so used to, guess what, there is nothing new here, only out there, you will need to accept this or otherwise it means giving up. What do you have to lose? Do whatever you have to do, I did not take any depression meds, you really think thats your way out of it? You do you, but remember, you will have to substitute it with a healthier solution, just like we did with envy earlier. Why? Because you will be dependent of what you use to fight it, even if it is completely healthy. My best bet would be exercising, if you are in that state of mind at least when working out you can say to yourself I'm fighting it, that alone makes me more noble and worthy, not to mention the chemical help your body will produce. Not into that? Are you social? Not? Be more social. Stay close to people, share with someone, it's not easy with help imagine alone. If you don't have anybody, well that's what this place is for right? Remember, all of it comes with struggle. Remember to embrace it, you don't have any other choice.

Don't go hard on yourself (you really shouldn't), or do, but don't go soft on yourself, never. That is exactly what brought you here, remember that you did not have it in you, what is done is done. Now it is time to stand up for yourself and fight against it, and with action.

I've been excelent for long periods of time now, I did have ups and downs but everytime it happens the climb looks shorter. You will develop a method. Mine is to keep my mind busy, to face the issue and never run from it. These past days I had another major tough break but in record time I goddamn dealt with it, for a long time it felt like something impossible and this is way I wanted to throw it on paper, just so I remember I can win this, and so can everyone else.

Peace guys and be welcome to share whatever you think about the subject, ask for specific help or criticise. It sure did me hella good telling you this, whoever you are."
1656,coping,i have nothing in my life to give me happiness. i don't want to do drugs. i don't want medication. all i have is food. is there anything else i could focus on while i wait for death?
1657,I just want to feel literally any emotion. I don’t care which one I just want to stop feeling so numb and empty.,Honestly any emotion. I have been so numb for so long. Not only do I never feel happy but I never really feel sad. I am just empty. Being able to cry would feel so amazing right now.
1658,I’m in so much pain,"I was suicidal at the beginning of September. My medication had made my depression worse and everything was overwhelming. My husband had asked me for a divorce 2 days prior. It was too much. I swallowed a bunch of pills but I forgot to wait for him to leave. It broke him. I survived. He told me if i hadn’t done it, maybe we could have saved the marriage. 

He told me the day after thanksgiving that he was in love with someone else and she’s pregnant. We just got married in March. He is the love of my life. Without him, my entire future is gone. All I’ve ever wanted to be is a mom. But now I don’t get that.

He says he’s torn between us right now but why would he choose the broken wife? My reasons for attempting in September seem so trivial compared to what I’m going through now. 

My entire family is dead. I have nobody to fall back on.  There’s nobody I can go to for comfort. I lost my entire family back to back. My aunt, then my grandma, then my mom. All before I was 20. Then I lost my animals. I’m 23 and now I’m losing my husband and his parents too. I’m going to be all alone again. I don’t want to be all alone again. 

I have friends but it’s not the same. I don’t want to lose the companionship and I very specifically love my husband. He was very badly mentally scarred from finding me. He made a shitty choice which is inexcusable but it doesn’t stop me from loving him. He also still loves me even though it’s probably not enough. 

I want to die. I don’t want to do that to my friends during Christmas which is the only thing holding me back right now. That and I don’t know which method I want to use. I don’t want to die but I can’t live in absolute agony anymore. My life has been a sad tragedy since I was 16. Constant death everywhere in my family. I just had another cousin die yesterday morning. I don’t wanna do this anymore. I just want my mom."
1659,Sadness,"Does anyone else just scroll through Instagram or any other site in the depression hashtags and just feel how much you relate to the posts.

Like it makes me feel worse but also understood at the same time."
1660,"Going nowhere, fast.","I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or I just want to vent to people that have no emotional attachment to me; but I just need to get this all out into the ether and out of my system so I don’t feel so choked by it. 

I turn thirty next month and I’m spiralling. 

Realistically I know that I’m still young and the world is my oyster and all that jazz. But it doesn’t stop that big black dog rearing it’s ugly head to make me feel like absolute shit. 

Thirty next month and I’ve done nothing with my life. I always thought I’d have something figured out by now, that I’d be something more than I am. A wife maybe, a mum, working in a job I was happy with... Yet, honestly, I barely function as an adult. 

I’m not working, I live with my mum, I don’t have a boyfriend or any romantic possibility on the horizon, I’ve cut myself off from almost all of my friends because I’m ashamed of the person I am (or rather, the person I’m not). I just feel so completely lost and scared that none of this is going to change. That I’ll blink and another ten years has passed and I’m still this...shadow of the person I should be. 

Can someone comfort me with news that everything just slots into place at some point? Maybe point me in the direction of a cynical farmhand with a heart of gold? Or, at the very least, send me cat memes to quiet the chaos for a few seconds?"
1661,Should I quit my job?,"I'm currently on a year out from college (also to do with mental health) and my plan was to just work hard for a year then do the final year of my degree.

I got a job in a call centre listening to customers complain at me about their shitty broadband all day. The job itself is draining enough but the workplace is even worse. 

I've missed 5 days over the space of 4 months and have explained (with doctors notes) to my employer that I'm not doing too well mentally. In spite of this I've been told I'm being disciplined and am going to have a meeting with our bosses and HR about it.

I've never had a job effect my day to day life in such a negative way before so at this point I just want to quit and move on to something different for the rest of my year out. I'm aware that I might be without work for a while and that I shouldn't quit without another job to go into but I'm literally coming home from work crying. Does this sound reasonable to leave?"
1662,(M. 18) Weird dreams that make me depressed,"I really don't know if this is the right subreddit for what I'm about to say, but Ill just go ahead I guess. 
So recently (about a year ago) I started having really uncomfortable and scary dreams.
It first started off as dreams about falling down a skyscraper, but they slowly turned into more horrible experiences which really made me feel more and more depressed over time, the dreams iam having right now, are about me killing my friends and seeing other really gory fucked up shit. I really don't know what's wrong with me.
Stuff like falling off a building in a dream really doesn't bother me for too long, most of the time it just startles me and then I can go back to sleep.
But the ones I have right now about my friends and other stuff, make me feel really fucking bad and sometimes even suicidal, I know it's not real but the feeling of killing someone really is.
When I get dreams like that it usually makes me feel really paranoid and sad for about 2 weeks.
But these constant states of feeling depressed have really influenced my life in a bad way, I'm currently in school 11 grade and I'm starting to skip school more and more just because of feeling like a guilty piece of shit.

Is there anyone who is also experiencing these kind of nightmares? Please tell me I'm not alone"
1663,Accidental near death experience whilst being suicidal,"Recently, I went through a really draining experience, mentally and physically.

I have been struggling with my mental health for a few years now, mostly due to long term health conditions and all the fun stuff that comes with it. I have had suicidal thoughts before but always been able to keep myself safe and prevent anything final from happening. However, I ended up becoming ill very quickly, in hospital for a few weeks fighting for my life. We still don't quite know the reason why this happened and most of the drugs used to try and help me were useless and my body had a hard time responding to them.

The weird thing is, I was kind of angry and still am. There I was, a suicidal individual who nearly died. Problem is, **I didn't choose to nearly die.** This all happened out of my control, yet you would think I would have been happy dying this way? No- I really wouldn't as it wasn't on my own terms.

As you can tell I still struggle slightly with ptsd from the incident and still struggle with my mental health but am taking every day as it comes."
1664,I Hate The Ones Who Say They Care,"  Grieving is a natural emotion, it's the logical feeling after a loved one passes. I know, I've been there. It hurts and time isn't the salve we've been sold. That's also why I know that the pain of my depression is more severe than grief. Suicide isn't selfish, feeling that someone ought to be alive because their death might cause you to question your mortality is."
1665,I did something,"I took a shower, shaved, and cleaned some of the house for the first time in a while. Yayyy"
1666,My dog just died,"My dog died suddenly and unexpectedly a week or so ago. It's been so much, I just don't know where to go, or what to think. I'm constantly angry and bitter and anxious about it, thinking that I must have done something wrong, thinking that I'm going crazy because my anxiety has exploded... She was a little maltese, 10 years old. I thought that she would at least live a few years more. She randomly had a stroke out of literally nowhere. One second, she was fine, the next second, she was in her death throes.

It's making me question myself too much. Putting me in a cycle of anxiety that I don't want to be in. Did I care for the dog enough? Did I do something wrong? I'm blaming it on someone else, but I don't want to do that, so I'm awful. And these awful statements just go on and on in my thoughts, driving me mad with anxious grief."
1667,ffs I just want to feel emotions again,Honestly any emotion. I have been so numb for so long. Not only do I never feel happy but never really feel sad. I am just empty. Being able to cry would feel so amazing right now.
1668,What’s the point.,Tomorrow I have my last final for this semester. I am currently on academic probation and will most likely get kicked out of school. I’m freaking the fuck out.  I’ve been trying to get my ba for about 10 years on and off. I just got married. I’m a fucking loser.
1669,AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH MY BRAIN,IT HURTS.
1670,hmm sleep,"i should probs go to sleep, but i’m desperate to SH and i’m enjoying the short moments of a nic rush. there’s no space on my arm anymore bc of rlly old scars taking ages to actually heal and i have a weird fear of doing it anywhere other than my arm.. fuck"
1671,"I lost all my friends, again","The same thing has happened my entire life. At first I thought I just picked bad friends, but now I know I’m the problem. I don’t know how to keep going when I can’t be alone and I have nobody that cares about me or cares if I die"
1673,hiding cuts,"hi! i would like to ask about how are you hiding your cuts/scars if theyre on the lower arm, wrist and hand. i am greatful for every advice."
1674,"Started a new job with depression, also jealous of my boyfriend's job!","I've started a new job, after being unemployed for almost 2 months and coming very close to not being able to pay rent, despite how panicked I felt during those 2 months I don't feel any better now! 

I've always suffered from generalised anxiety and depression, so I can have a negative perspective, but I'm just really not feeling it with this job and my depression feels worse! 

It's a customer service job in a field I'm usually happy to be in, but I felt like I was fibbed too about the role. I thought I would be advising customers or helping them with complaints, and I distinctly remember in my interview the interviewees said ""there is no sales involved in this role"" and saying ""it's not like a call centre"", however, now that I've started training there is marketing and sales techniques being brought up, then I learn it's actually a huge part of the role, and I couldn't be less interested! 

Also, it's all in an office, I'm used to working outside or on location which I really enjoy, being in an office is already tough for me, plus I have to commute an hour there and back, PLUS they only give 10 days holiday!

I have already been struggling with anxiety and depression, and I actually feel worse on this job, and people really don't understand, I try telling my parents how I'm really not feeling it but they keep encouraging me to stay, I guess because it's good money, but I'd prefer a job I love being at everyday for less money than what I'm getting now. 

My motivation is so low, and I'm struggling, I am actually behind on the training because I have nothing in me that wants to move forward wth this company, but I kind of need to for money!"
1675,Horrible Person,"I feel like I'm a horrible person and I cant do anything right.
I feel like everything I come into contact with I ruin, whether that be friendships or just having a conversation with someone.
I feel like I will never be great enough and no one should be friends with me. Tbh if someone said to my face that they hated me, I would be hurt but I would understand why.
I'm a horrible person and hurt everyone."
1676,Struggling with break up.,"I'm a 21 year old male, ex girlfriend is the same age. We broke up last week, I cut contact on friday night. We were together a little over a year, have been good friends since we were 15. We tried keeping things civil, until we had less going on in our lives so we could maybe try again. Shes told me she still has feelings, and so do I. But we got into a dumb argument while i was drunk, and I told her to delete my number, took her off all social media etc. It is about to be 72 hours since that fight, and I'm thinking I made a mistake. Maybe I didn't.  Maybe it's best we go our separate ways. I dont know what to do, I feel so lost and restless. Please reddit, help me out"
1677,Suicidal thoughts are coming back,"I've had suicidal thoughts in the past, because of my depressive state, but in some point I really stopped and think about it, and convinced myself that it don't make sense, so they slowly ceased. But now I'm feeling that they're coming back.

I don't know if it's because things are getting worse and worse, and I'm loosing the very little hope I had. I'm worried. I don't think I have the courage to kill myself, especially because I don't want to traumatize anyone that loves me, but I don't want to start fantasizing about me commiting suicide."
1678,I just hate myself so much for all the things I never did. I’m only 21 and I’ve felt this way for so long.,"The only thing that made me happy was music, and as a teen I swore I’d have a career in it, but of course I never did. I never pursued anything in music, I only ever did what my parents told me to do. Now not even music motivates me, and what I study in college certainly doesn’t motivate me either. I hate myself so much for not doing all the things I should’ve done to get what I want, to make myself happy. Why do I feel like this? Why have I always felt like this? It’s so fucking annoying, and I hate myself even more for feeling this way instead of being grateful for all of the great things in my life. Why can’t I feel anything but guilt, shame, and anger, and at best boredom or apathy?"
1679,Mental issues making me question my relationship," My (20f) boyfriend (21m) of 9 months went away for 5 weeks to the other side of the world. He’s only been gone for 3 days, but I don’t think I can make it for these weeks. I really miss him. He is 8 hours ahead of me, we texted a few times already, but it doesn’t help me feel better. We can’t really call or facetime at all.  I will admit that in relationships I need physical touch and in-person communication. For that reason I would never agree to do a long distance relationship, but since this is just a vacation, of course I’m not gonna tell him I don’t want him to leave, because that would not be fair to him.
Our relationship is good overall, but the main problem is me. I have mental health issues and he is very supportive of them. But him being gone for 5 weeks is really inflaming my issues and making me miserable. I do believe that our relationship would survive the distance if it wasn’t for my stupid depression and ocd. And I’m so mad at my issues for possibly ruining this wonderful relationship. He is the most amazing man. And I feel so shitty for considering breaking up with him over this...But him being so far and our communication being so little I am really miserable and questioning whether I should break up for my own mental sake or stay and wait for him to come back? I feel so awfully selfish for even thinking of breaking up with him just because he is gone on a vacation. I feel so guilty and weak for it. I really don’t want to let him go over this and I know I will instantly regret it the moment he comes back and Ill want to get back with him because I do love him, but it’s just that this distance is absolutely miserable and terrible for me. I don’t know what to do"
1680,I (23f) broke up with my boyfriend and now i have no one,"My boyfriend (well ex boyfriend) and I dated for 3 months. He always seemed annoyed or frustrated with me no matter what I did. I care about him but I'm not so sure how he felt about me and I only stayed with him because I'm terrified of being alone but it got to a point where being with him made my depression worse. So last night I broke up with him. Now I am alone. Ever since I graduated college and had to move back home, I haven't really had friends. I don't have anyone to go out and do things with. I'm so desperate for attention that I have to resist the urge to download tinder.

I know all of this is unhealthy, i just have no where to turn right now"
1681,I can't get out of bed anymore,"I'm trying to pretend to be okay for my family, I recently came clean about dropping out of uni and my mom isn't too happy about it. I'm falling apart and I feel like I can't tell anyone, seeing as I wasted all the money my mom doesn't have on uni fees only to leave with no degree. I have no plan for what I plan to do after this and it makes me want to just lie in my bed and fantazise about sinking into the floor and being suffocated to death. Only thing keeping me sane is drinking and even then I can't drink everyday without setting off red flags."
1682,do you want to die or do you just don’t want to feel this way anymore.,"this quote hit me so hard, i don’t want to be alive but i don’t want to kill myself either, i just wish i could start over and have a different life."
1683,What I think about when I think of you,"Hello I found this poem I wrote a few weeks ago and revised it to post here. Maybe someone can relate to what I am feeling. I am having a hard time lately. Cheers.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last time we didn’t say goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

After all the times we said farewell

knowing we would see each other again.

How you’d look sad that we’d be apart

but happy that we’d be together later.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder now how my face looked

when we would part ways.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder what I would have felt

if I could have felt anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

But I remained distant from my emotions till now

where they’ve become mounds of sadness

pools of dread

waiting to trip me up."
1684,Impulse to disappear,"I'm itching to pick up my cash and necessities and leave everyone behind. I'd leave my phone, friends and family behind. I'm at my wits ends with everyone"
1685,My Story. I guess,"Not sure if this is the right place, because I haven't been diagnosed with anything, but I need a place to write everything down somehow. 

**Here goes:**

I've been feeling sad for years. Not constantly, more like every now and then, getting more and more. No one knows this about me, because I'm too scared to talk to my family and friends and the one person I talked to about not feeling happy, told me this might be a ""quarter-life-crisis"" and to take some Iron pill to pump up my motivation. I don't think my parents would mock me or something, but I'm scared they're gonna say: ""It's just a phase"" or ""Everybody feels sad sometimes"". They are experts in making my problems seem less important than their own.

It is generally very hard for me to communicate with anybody about my feelings. I had a really great Ex-Boyfriend (1 year ago) but every time he asked me if I wanted to go out or ""out"" myself with him in public, I made up excuses and I just couldn't be myself around him. Which is weird, because I actually felt kind of comfortable. 

The sadness has resulted in me punching a wall, injuring my hand permanently ,on multiple times. This summer, I actually cut myself with the pieces of a broken glass bottle twice. Told my ""friends"" I had fallen into some glass shards and been attacked by a cat. Nobody seemed to care, they didn't ask any further questions. I don't think I did this to get attention, because I try to hide wounds/scars/bruises so that I don't get asked any questions. 

I also drink a lot. Beer, Vodka, Gin anything with a high percentage, almost every night. I know that alcohol is a natural depressant, so I can't actually tell how much of what I'm feeling is actually just the alcohol. I'm generally a very sensitive person, I cry at everything. Nobody knows this about me. Around my family and friends I'm known as the funny, confident, weird person who get's angry quickly, but I think the fact that I'm confident (on the outside) and that I would and have put my life on hold, to help them is why they keep me around. Even though I might seem confident on the outside, I don't feel like that on the inside at all. It takes my at least 10mins to make a phone call, because I have to rehearse everything I want to say multiple times. Meeting new people is super exhausting but after 2/3 beers I'm ready to talk to anyone. 

I sleep a lot, when I can. Mostly I lie awake at night, thinking about everything and why I'm sad and how to get rid of it. 

I know I should talk to a therapist. I've had 3 appointments. I didn't go to a single one, because I couldn't make myself and at my Uni it's free. I always feel stressed. Even though my life is not always stressful. For days on end I don't go to Uni, I eat a lot, I drink during the day. I don't know how to stop myself. 

I think the only thing keeping my afloat at the moment is my dog. She's the sweetest. A lot of work, because she needs her exercise, but that's good for me, because she forces me to go outside. 

Honestly I don't even know who I am. Last week I told a person I have lived in Hungary for a short time, because I accidentally said I've lived in 3 instead of 2 countries and I felt so embarrassed that I couldn't take it back. 

So I think that's it. My Story, if it even belongs here.

*Sorry for grammar, etc. English is not my first language.*"
1686,Wish I had a family.,"I (16M) have never had the experience of having a family because my parents, my brother (who I don't get along with) and I live overseas and I have only seen my actual family twice (2 weeks each visit). I would like to know how it feels like having a family."
1687,Hirings is BS,"After looking for work for over a year i only manged to find a casual job... When i was in today taking to someone who works their, they told me that they dont hire college graduates for full time because their are too many colleges in the city and hire university graduates because their are only a few..

Is that even legal? 

It was at a community centre, was told they were a good place to start out at when you graduated from the program 

college graduates have more hands on experience.. University have more books but a different experience..

I felt awful after hearing that im almost graduated but now i dont know what i have to look forward to since im only now being told places would rather hire university graduates.."
1688,My Lack of Emotions has Destroyed Any Chance I had at Life,"Ever since my family move when I was in high school, I have been depressed and felt extremely uncomfortable talking to anyone I wasn't familiar with on a personal level. 10+ years later, I'm almost 30. I still can't start a conversation with a stranger and I don't really have a social group anymore since my one friend went back to College.
I spent so much of my adult life unable to do anything, but suffer alone, doing nothing but work or go to school. Now I'm able to afford to be on my own, but with that my work hours increased to ~55 a week. 
Every attempt I have made to find friends or not be alone has ended in failure. I was in a long relationship, but it fell apart due to my inability to feel anything.

That is my main point. I don't feel anything anymore. I gain enjoyment from nothing, I don't want to do anything, and nothing I do has any effect on anything. I am only able to passively accept everything that happens to me because there is no point in resisting. 
I come to the point where I found there is nothing for me. I have tried everything I could, and nothing works. There is nothing you can recommend that I havent tried. 
Some days I'm depressed, some days I feel nothing. I don't know what to do any more. It feels like all my life is work. I keep thinking about going to a doctor try and find another date, but I know that will end like my previous experiences. 

I don't know anymore. What's the point in going on. I feel feel like I'm at the stage of my acceptance stage of my depression, and not killing myself is just wasting everyone's time."
1689,A Friend left,"So a friend, let’s call him M left to go to a school across the country because his mom needed to and honestly he was the only person I’ve ever really loved. Maybe not romantically, or whatever anything like that, but more like I could spend the rest of my life with him. I just smiled inside whenever I saw him. He’s been gone for some time now, and I just feel so dead inside. I wish he came back, and he told me he might be coming back. I broke down last night seeing a picture of him, so yeah. God I just wish he was next to me. This feeling hurts worse than anything I’ve had before, I feel physically sick all the time."
1690,Hopeless cycle,"Hi,

I just need to talk to someone, but recently it feels like there’s less and less people that care. 

I have had major/minor depressive disorder since I was 16. I’m 21 now turning 22 soon. There’s times where things are good, I’m happy enough, don’t really adamantly not want to be here. 

But no matter what, eventually these thoughts return. I just think how I wish I were dead. It’s not like im actively trying to kill myself, but sometimes I just wish something would happen and free me from myself. 

People always say it’ll get better, and u know what, it does. Then it gets bad again. It’s a never ending cycle of bullshit. 

Thanks for reading."
1691,"Hey, I am a 13y/o diagnosed with depression by a psychologist","I know, there are many who probably think this is fake and stuff. And I think there wont be many people who are going to see this or even read this, but I won't care for now. 

Currently, I struggle a lot (probably because it's winter) but it's getting worse and worse and I don't know what to do. So I thought that I won't let this thoughts stay inside of me and let them all out. I hope I don't bother anyone.

I never really talked about it, except my therapist and my mother (she's really supportive)  but the thing is, I see my therapist every two weeks and my mum has so many things to do, I just don't want to annoy her. She struggled too much and I also love her. 
In my class, I don't really have anyone. I had many friends last year, but now I feel kinda left alone. They all have their groups and friends and
...I have no one there. I feel so worthless there. 
No one wants to really talk to me there, unless they need me to do something for them.
That makes it worse, but it could of course be even more worse, so I'm kinda happy about that.
I try to have my thoughts under control and not hurt myself, but it's so hard to tell my parents or someone else. It's such a miracle for me to write this down. I'm literally crying. But I'm happy to let it all kinda out. 

I often feel like I don't have the right to say that I have depression. My life is pretty good so...i feel bad about that. It makes me feel worthless, ungreatful, useless and often suicidal. And then it gets worse and worse. I also have diabetes, of course, not that bad, but it makes me really feel ashamed and bad sometimes.
There were points when I really wish I would be dead, but I won't kill myself. I am loved by my family and I am also too afraid. Even If I feel like dying. 
I can do this.

Also, I keep telling myself that I am clean for over 1 month now, and I can be proud of this!:)


I am so sorry if I bother anyone with this or If someone thinks, I am ungreatful or something else. I know that...
But I am thankful for everybody who was there for me and still is
And I am thankful to everybody who read this :) 
We can do this 
Have a good night 


(Btw. I'm German so broken English I'm sorry)"
1692,I speak quicker than I can think,"It’s like what I want to say is trying to catch up with what’s coming out of my mouth and it’s failing miserably. 

Basically, I find it hard to phrase things when speaking because my thoughts are too slow to come up with a coherent sentence. It sucks."
1693,How can someone forgive me if I'm the reason of their trigger,"I didn't mean to. I asked how her episodes trigger during her working hours w/c leads to activate it.

It's almost a week and still she feel super down. I know it's my fault. She also let me come to her place, I don't know how to comfort her also because I'm the reason of what does she feel right now. It's hard for me because I don't know what to do. We talk normally but I know deep down she is hurting and I can't just live with it like that.

What should I do?"
1694,I need help,"Lately I have been thinking about my depressive state, and all my life/internal problems, and I came to the conclusion that I don't know what the fuck is happening. I don't know if I (possibly) have some personality disorder, that led to my depression or something like that, or I just (possibly) have depression because my life is going downhill, or even if I (possible) have depression at all, and it's just a hard moment and this deep sadness will get better.

I'm so confused right now, I was convinced to see a psychologist, but I don't know anymore...

Any tips of what to do? Should I wait to see if it passes, or go to a psychologist regardless that?

Sincerely, I would feel a little ashamed if the psychologist says that I don't have nothing at all..."
1695,I just wanna die in front of everyone,"I wanna die in agonizing pain, from the most horrible thing in front of everyone I know. I want them to feel bad for once in their life, and I want them to feel guilty that they made me do it. I wanna just die and start over again, or never live at all. I want every person who doesn't understand to just dissapear. I'm not depressed, just hate everyone I know because they don't understand what I've been through and how it feels to get surgery all the time and get pricked 10 times a month with a needle, and just overall had my life ruined. I'm short, shy, have a goddamn ileostomy tied to me for all my life, and everything else nobody likes. im just an unwanted, hated little being"
1697,I dont feel anything at all,"Most if the time I feel absolutely nothing. I'm so passive that I don't feel anymore. I'm not happy and I'm not sad, for a week I was angry but that's gone too now."
1698,Atypical depression?,"I feel like I have atypical depression but then I always have thoughts in the back of my mind that I’m just telling myself I have a problem. I’m (19F) &amp; I think my mental health is getting worse as I get older?
Somebody tell me if this makes sense

My sleeping habits have been poor, I’ll come home from class and fall asleep from 7-10pm then wake up for 45 minutes and pass out til 2 or so then wake up for 30 minutes then finally get up for work at 530 am. Every day I count the hours til its 7 pm. I feel like I go to sleep mostly because I don’t want to do anything else. 

My eating habits are also poor, I’ll binge and overeat for a few days then gains a few pounds then try to stop eating for a few days and lose the weight again. The cycle continues. 

I feel like the emotional sensitivity shows more when I’m with my parents. We constantly clash more than we ever used to &amp; they always make remarks about my extreme emotions during our arguments. I’ve also had some episodes of freaking out on friends recently. 

I also smoke weed every day &amp; I don’t know if that’s relevant or not because I’ve been doing that since last February. I haven’t noticed these symptoms for more than the last few months. 

I have had a couple traumatic events occur in the last couple months but I’m not really sure exactly what the cause of this would be."
1699,Laughing makes me cry,"When I laugh really hard I start crying but it's not just tears from laughing it's actual sad crying. 
It feels like I push it down so hard that when it sees a chance to escape it just gets out."
1700,Ever Feel Like You Don't Matter?,"Lately I have been down, like more than usual. I really don't know how to feel. There's recently been a lot of things that have got me down and I feel as if im running out of strength to ""combat"" them. Idk im rambling"
1701,I went to my first therapy appointment.,"""I don't lie to my patients. I tell people at their lowest when I can see them being happy again. I see the strength and courage in you. It won't always be this hard.""

And despite wanting to not believe it because it's hard to believe I will feel anything but nothing forever, I do believe her. And I can't wait."
1702,I get anxiety thinking about doing anything,"A disclaimer : I was never diagnosed with anxiety but that's bc I never went to get a diagnosis about anything. 

I have a really long vacation rn between school and something else. it has already been 6 months and I have 2 more left. I don't have a job and I basically don't do anything, I mostly watch movies and write about them, edit video essays and watch YouTube and obviously my parents are not very happy about it. They want to me to get a job or go volunteer somewhere I volunteered before. 
They are not aware at all about my issues with depression and anxiety and that's a step that I still have to go through but anyways, whenever I even think about going outside I get anxiety. 
I feel my heart beating out of my chest and my palms start to sweat and I get real nervous so I distract myself most of the time but when my parents start rambling and saying that I have to do something with my life, I swear I can't stand it anymore it almost always brings me to choke on tears that I have to hide. 
I know they don't mean to harm me but I did hint at them a lot that it makes me nervous and that I do things at my own pace but they just started yelling at me that my pace is not good enough and that it's stupid."
1704,How do I know I need to see a therapist?,"I'm completely new to r/depression, but a lot of people are talking about going to therapist and I was just wondering how do you know you need to go and see one?"
1705,Talk to each other.,"What the title said. I’d really like to just chat sometimes, with no further actions than just chat. I don’t really get Reddit, I’m not sure."
1706,Heaven knows I'm miserable now,
1708,The think of my boyfriend finding out that I have started self harming again after being 2 yrs clean is making me suicidal,"Basically the subject says it all. My SO will be in town for the holidays, we were apart for almost 4 months, he was aware that I used to self harm back in two yrs ago. I was clean when we got together but the scars were noticeable. He knows I had some break down episodes recently but, he doesn’t know the depth. I am sure he will notice the new scars and this is making harm myself more and be suicidal :("
1709,Im waiting now,I give up. I slashed my wrist multiple times and now theres a good size blood pool under my arm. Any way I can speed this up? Waiting is painful and boring
1710,Only feel satisfaction from being self-destructive?,How to stop? Idk. I dont feel satisfaction from doing things that are ' good for me'. Dont know how to change that...
1711,Dark honesty.,"You ever feel like sharing something so dark to someone but don't want to ruin the mood?

I mean, I'm glad I have friends that get me when it comes to that, and I understand optimism is an important thing to have at times, but I hate just pretending everything's okay. It's like I have to ignore my problems for the people that don't wanna hear it. But then, is that all in my head? How do I know they don't wanna hear it? All of this questioning just makes it that much harder to figure out whether I should mention anything to them."
1712,I don't feel like doing anything,I'm always so tired. I have no energy or want to do anything.
1713,Message to all.,"I know that all of us are suffering and our pain is hard to understand with everyone saying they have depression but only saying it cuz it apparently makes them quirky but from someone who is working to fix it I'll listen. if you need someone to talk to I'm here, if you need to unload some emotional baggage to someone who will listen, I'm here"
1714,How do I tell my mother I am depressed/suicidal,"I'm depressed for a while now and it's getting worse and worse, I really need professional help. But I just don't know how to tell my mother how I feel. I tried dropping hints like saying I can't sleep or feel stressed out but she just keeps saying it'll get better. I really don't know what to do, I don't know how long I can keep fighting my thoughts like this."
1715,I really hope that we will all someday get better,"I really don’t want to give up hope, but it’s getting harder and harder to stay positive. Hope we can all find peace"
1716,For the first time in my Life I do not care whether I die or not,"I was somewhat feeling 'proud' that I never had any suicidal thoughts or whatsoever even tho my life has been messed n fucked up since I can think of

I'm just tired. Tired of keep losing people that I love, tired talking to myself saying that everything will be fine even though it never will be.

I'm normally not that kind of guy posting any of this stuff it just that I don't have anyone I can call these but myself

Hope you all have a decent Monday."
1717,Stuck,"I am 32, unemployed and have no support system anymore. I'm always there for people but they are never there for me. When I open up, they disappear. When I try to talk about anything other than illness, I am ignored. This illness has taken everything from me, and I don't know what to do to fix it anymore. I'm in therapy. I've tried meds. Not sure how much longer money is going to last. 


I've isolated myself so much that I have no one to turn to. What is the point of trying anymore?"
1718,"Living a wrong life, slowly giving up on everything","I know I may sound pathetic but I wanted to express myself for once.

So i'm a 21 yo guy living the worst moment of my life (till now), bc it feels like everything is going wrong and i can't do anything about it.

I'm in 3rd year of engineering and still can't pass my courses' specific exams. But i've never got good grades, mostly bc i can't study, i just sit and overthink about everything or stare at nothing or look at instagram.

I only have 2 friends and see them on saturdays, but they never chat me. It happens many times that when i'm out with them, i just instantly become sad and quit the conversation. Tried to make some friends at uni but they don't want me in their group, and i'm too shy to just sit and talk to someone.

I play football but always benching bc I'm a goalkeeper, not too bad technically (they say) but i'm 5' 6"" (1.70m) and not a single coach ever trusts me. I'm su unmotivated but they keep forcing me to stay in that club and I feel too bad to just leave when the transfer market is closed.

My mom is constanlty insulting me and screaming that i have no friend, no gf, underperforming at uni and football, and i'm gonna die alone if I continue like this. My dad looks also depressed bc he lives to work for me and mum, come back at home very late and argue with her.

My ex left me like a year ago and I still think about her and hope one day she may come back. I was so in love with her, many people told us ""we were perfect"" but her parents hated me and one day she left all of a sudden. From that moment, i just can't get along with people, can't speak to anybody bc i'm afraid i'm gonna annoy them or i don't know what to talk about, i can't look at them into the eyes and i'm scared to just talk for something normal.

I have serious anxiety (I got prescribed xanax but refused to take it bc god i felt even sadder when the effect was over) and i'm somehow of nocturnal and insomniac... i sleep like 5 hrs per day and i'm so tired everyday that my head spins, my eyes burns, i can't understand anything at uni nor what people tell me... sometimes i even mumble.

And i just hate myself. No passions, no hobbies, nothing to do at home, no friends, nowhere to go... i just feel lost. And when I get out I feel depressed when I see everybody is engaged while I'm scared to say hi to a cashier. Plus i'm ugly, but most of all I feel FAULTY. I mean, I'm short and thin but i have no time to train muscles, and I also got surgery at my navel, so i can't do abs. I'm balding (a lot, like one side reaches the top of my head), I have psoriasis to the hair, a big nose, oily skin with lot of pimples, small eyes, few beard, my body is hairy and my mandible is bent, resulting in a swollen and bigger cheek (literally idk how i had a gf).

Thank you for just reading this, I've never talked about this to anybody I still feel I have no serious problem but i forgot how to smile and I see my life running away while i do nothing."
1719,Enough is enough 😤,"I successfully aged myself to 30 from 16... i want normal life, no more drama in life."
1720,Give me one good reason to not walk outside in this storm and get struck by lightning,"I'm 25 years old, I walk with a geriatric Walker to get around.

I shit and piss myself in my sleep.

My ceiling has a hole in it where rodents fall through nightly.

Im stuck in a dirty shack with an abusive father

I havent been touched sexually in over a year and I can no longer touch myself.

I've been rejected by over 200 jobs in the past 3 months.

The woman I love does not reciprocate. 

I get excruciating headaches. 15/10 worst pain imaginable. 

I would try to hang out and wait for things to get better but I'm done. I dont want to continue this suffering any longer."
1722,I just can’t do this,"Getting a college degree is a lie. It doesn’t open up the world. I can’t even get a job washing dishes with a degree and solid work history (until now).

I’m too old to join the military, my relationship and a stagnant. I love at home and desperately want to leave, but I can’t even get enough money together to get into housing. 

I’m seriously considering killing myself."
1723,10. 16.19. an open letter for i thought this time my depression will overtake me but i survived,"i hope for my death so soon... i don't want to live longer. 17 fucking years of being bullied. i have lots of witness but no one ever did try to defend me instead they all laugh. to my parents, they're wasn't there for me. to be awared by the signs and behavior changing. they didn't want to admit that there is something going on more than being literally bullied. being alongside with my classmates last year was a nightmare. i didn't expect to be called as psycho and everyone meant to laugh at me. i was defenseless. i cried silently... sobbing...

i was on my treatment restoring my health regards being anemic because of trouble sleeps ― an insomniac. i was feeling well not until a guy make fun of me. he bullied me. i was absent-mindedly drifted looking at the ground. his voice... it's like a curse in my ear. it frightens me. everyone started to laugh. everyone has the chance to speak but remain silent. 

they enjoyed being insensitive. they enjoyed being a mock. they all enjoyed being coward. they enjoyed seeing me helpless and defenseless.

i was so scared that i could've move my feet... my body to go home.



the next day...

last subject in class. 

my teacher scolded me of seeing me loath and musing in the middle of the class. i receive judgement instead of asking and cared with my actions. i feel embarrassed.

my classmates started making fun of me again. calling my surname in an insulting way... 

i can't help but to cry. i keep holding back my tears off but it won't. i was weakened. 

after reaching home. i didn't speak about it to my mom. i remain in silent. why? i knew she will only turn me down, talking shit about it. blaming me for being like this and like that. ""hindi ka kasi marunong makihalubilo. hindi ka kasi marunong makisama"" as if she didn't taught me to be a well raised child. without even asking first and thought of why? why didn't even considering what i feel mom? i was bullied then getting home, this is what all am i gonna receive? most of the time, i used to think that she don't love me. she doesn't. she didn't care for me. she just knew being superior about being a mom, being a parent literally. cuz it is only about the fact that she is along with my dad who's sending me to school to study. they were used to provide my needs and wants regards allowance, food, clothes even a house to settle in. how ironic right?

being reminded with that relation to my parents makes me don't want to idolize them anymore. it makes me lose my respect and forgotten my love for them. as i grew up i slowly build walls for them to be in distant. cuz i don't trust em eversince i turned seeing reality differently. it's no fun and easy to get along with your dreams and hopes. 

i have a brother yes. but he is not always around. he loves being out of home. spending time with his barkadas, smoking and being in the court game. he used to woke up early than me and getting home late around 11 pm or half past midnight. some of the times, it extended to 1 or 3 am. we weren't close to each other. all i knew that he hates me for not knowing the reasons at all. and it hurts. 

yes i lived in a complete family but feels like i am not. it was shallowed and they we're narrowed. it feels like not a home with them. bc we didn't talk about life, about how we feel regards to our life outside. they only used to judge and refuse to pay attention and listen. 

and i am friendless. ever since i was a little i didn't had the chance to feel like a normal kid who have lots of friends to come over and be with. i do have but it's shallow. it feels like i am only being with them to feel belong and not so alone. 

until i get in the middle school. still no friends. i became feel awkward of being me cuz still no one likes me for what and who i am. i play guitar, i sing, i dance, i draw, i write; poetry, i love acting. some say that i am smart and kind. i excel in terms of academic performances. i care for other's feelings than they should too. that's who i am and still no one likes me. 

as i grew up, i see lots of teens who obviously love being friends with the one who has the popularity. who are receiving hundreds of likes with every picture that that person post. the one who has the looks, the wealth and the one who has the power. when you are involve into a fight, gang fight you are loved. you are praised esp when there's something on you that makes them think to go favor on you as if that is what having a great friends to be. when you have this and those you are loved. 

i accepted those reality of the world. the world i have being with my classmates and family. 

i became introvert. avoiding myself with the negativity of life. trying to be positive all alone in silent. but know what's worse? they still have the guts to say &amp; throw shits about you. even how remain silent you are and not allowing yourself to get in their lives thinking you will just fuck it and mess it. so you chose to be isolated. 

i became introvert cuz everyone don't want me obviously. they don't want me on my highest and bestest. they could've congratulate me yet they chose to not. anyone of you might think they're just jealous but i think they are not. there's nothing about me to be jealous of. i am just a loser and a failure as everyone think. how could they even feel envy about me? even on my lowest and shady pace being alive, they don't stop. they still haunting me. watching me falling apart, breaking and making me lose all i've got.

and yes i am here again at this point of my life losing interest in studying. because my classmates made me do so... my parents were mad at me bc of opening about my thesis issue. blaming me again that it is my fault. instead of comforting and supporting me at this lowest. 

""tapusin mo nalang. wag kana mag-aral kung ganyan lang din. magtrabaho ka nalang.""



i don't want to live longer for i reminisce those nightmares and reminding only myself as a loser, a failure.


i want to end this here. i'm giving up to graduate next year. i'm not gonna make it. i'm giving up to review for PUPCET for my dream course. i was happy knowing alr what im gonna take but i'll pass. i'm giving up my passion regards music. i was planning to go for another gig but everything has paid with madness, despair and losing. 



i'm sorry.

i love you mama, papa and kuya."
1724,"Last month, I failed at taking my own life.","My days feel really weird now. Kind of like I’m in a trance. I don’t feel like I’m myself anymore and  it’s creeping me out. I don’t recognise myself.

No one knows about this. I can’t talk or open up. I don’t know what to do anymore. I think I really fucked up and I can’t help but think there’s no going back to who I was before my attempt. Depression is swallowing me whole. 
[25f]"
1725,Worthlessness and the path to death,"The abyss' stare cuts mercilesslly through my soul. A well-honed blade that brings both shame and excitement to my depressed mind.

The burden of existence exhausts me and brings me to my knees. Making me beg for the suffering to end, screaming for just a single moment of quietness inside my troubled mind.

The void inside me fills my days with an aching desire for something I cannot have. Human contact is what I crave most, the feeling of intimacy with another human being who trusts and fancies me enough to allow me touch them. This, however, stays only on my mind.

The numbness and surge or pleasure, even though fake and artificial, when I indulge in addictive activities seem to help me forget at least for a moment my lack of desire to seek happiness, whatever the meaning of this word is. Perhaps a stable job, money, friends is what they mean by happiness. And I certainly don't have any of those while I rot inside my room.

The end seems to be near, travelling fast to finally encounter me and get this over with. I feel guilty for doing this to my family, the only people who seem to like me, but also angry at the world, angry at everyone who bullied, laughed at me, made me cry so many nights and treated me bad for apparently no reason other than the pleasure of humiliating a weak being like me.

Talent is something I never had, so I feel pathetic by attempting to write something that even tries to resemble  a poetic text, though letting out feelings is inevitable at this point. I'm breaking down and no one is there to hold me when I fall. Down the abyss.

ps: english is not my first language, sorry for mistakes or any odd wording. just wanted to write something about how i'm feeling"
1726,Just need more confidence,"This is something people close to me always tell me. I don't understand how anyone with a history of severe depression can have confidence. I feel like I've been brought to so many low points in my life from social encounters that I perceived as a negative experience. 

What I'm trying to get at is how do I build confidence in social situations when I know how easily I can experience anxiety/depression if a social encounter doesn't go my way."
1727,Have been trying to take care of myself.,"Hello all I'm a 22 year old male. I have been stuck in a depression for a few years now, and have been neglecting my personal health since then. I am completely unhappy with myself. I have recently resolved to try and start taking better care of myself. I started doing stuff like washing my hair, and shaving regularly. I know it doesn't sound like much at all, But sometimes its difficult. Most of the time I feel like I am not worth it at all. 
I'm my second day in of trying to care for myself. I feel a little bit better, But I'm still not happy with myself. Wish me luck all :)"
1728,I feel empty.,Its like having a hole in the chest everyday. Nothing could fill it.
1729,Is love truly a good thing? (bitter post),"These past weeks more guys were attracted to me and asked me to be their girlfriend. Now you could say ‚hey that‘s a great thing‘ but sadly it‘s not. They‘re all boys that tell every other women things like „I love you, you‘re the most beautiful“. They don‘t love the true me, they love the idea of being in love and they‘re bored and horny. Like they don’t even know my hobbies for example and already talk about „forever love“. I‘m actually proud because I don‘t open myself to anyone.

I‘m currently sad in bed, I don‘t like this entire situation of me being used for such stuff. I hate it... can you guys share similar stories or something else.."
1730,i want to die ?,"I’ve attempted twice this year . Not bragging, just giving context . 

I want to die but also I’m content with being A nobody - so in reality I’m dead to everyone apart from a few close friends and family members?

Maybe I’m just scared of life, or maybe I’m 18 and I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing.

Or maybe I thought uni would be best until I spoke to my lecturer who said : “Cassie, I can see you going down hill”"
1731,I Don’t Eat Anymore,"It’s not because I hate my body or anything like that - I’m actually quite comfortable in that respect, but I just don’t want to eat anymore. I know it’s my depression. I now I eat about 500-600 calories a day (down from about 2300) and I know it’s bad for me. I dropped 10 pounds in about twelve days with no exercise whatsoever. I just don’t enjoy eating. It’s easier to lie in bed all day and sleep away the pain that I feel than to go to my dining hall or something and eat food. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice?"
1733,Fuck college. I can't do this anymore,"Hey guys,

So this year I started to study theater in college and all I've done is fuck everything up. 

I'm underperforming in all the (at least the major) classes in my degree , One of my profs even told me I'm the worst one on my class and though they haven't directly stated they'd fail me, I feel they might, although I'm still trying to make it back up.

Right now I don't even want to go to certain classes, in essence, practical ones where I'll be told to do something the professors will criticize for some reason, I'm not even lazy, I'm just sick of this.

The problem is that I'm doing what I want, I always wanted to be an actor (professionally) and so I'm where one would want to be (Well.. except for the other part), so I don't want to quit, I just wished I could be doing better, I also have my family members rooting for me and I don't really want to let them down. 

So yeah, I'm also in deep shit, how are you?"
1734,"Hey, can I talk to someone please?",
1735,yay,"its around 10 c cold here. im lonely and sad. i just wanted someone to talk to. tried my friends. nobody responded. all doing their own thing. yay. i locked my door. switched on the ceiling fan full speed. stripped down to underwear. keeping 4 ice cubes in moith. shivering. hope i do. it always has felt so coldand lonely. but my best friend, the cold never left. hopefully, it'll escort be to eternal peace. im crying for attention haha...someone talk to me please..."
1736,I’m Talk To Myself More Than Anyone Else In This World,"I really don’t know what’s self with me but i feel more comfortable talking to myself than talking with anyone else. I can’t even manage to have a simple conversation with my family. It’s like having two different personalities.

First is a happy, confident voice that keeps me company when I’m alone and a personality that has nothing to good  or ingesting say and is socially awkward when around the presence of others.

Maybe I don’t have a personality of maybe I’m just a weird person but I can’t rest a-sure  that I enjoy the company of the little voice in my head and hope he would come out and take over my personality."
1737,I want to induce hallucinations without drugs,I'm just kind of sick of reality. Is this possible if I just dont sleep for a while? I know this is bad. But like I'm kind of desperate lmao
1738,"If the brain’s main function is to survive, why do I constantly want to kill myself?",Thinking about it that way really mind fucked me.
1739,All I want for Christmas is sanity.,"Okay, maybe that's not exactly accurate, I'd like financial security, love, and a whole bunch of other shit my life is lacking.   


But if I had my sanity...maybe I'd acquire some if not all of that. I live in a constant nightmare, mostly of my own making. My mind is always racing with thoughts of what I should be doing, how I should be acting, how a well-adjusted person would handle the situations I handle. But I don't follow my own mind...I don't man up and get a job, I don't interact with society and try to ease myself into being able to hold a conversation with another human being again. I just wallow in despair, run from people (sometimes not just metaphorically) and continue to collapse my life around me.   


I have nothing left but my cat, no friends, no family, no money, no goals, no happiness, no love. I feel powerless to change any of it, even when I know there's something I can and should do...I don't. I just can't bring myself to do anything and continue to watch my life fall apart around me.   


I miss my mom so fucking much this time of year. Even before I completely broke down I didn't have much, but I had her. One person truly cared about me and loved me...and that was enough. I don't need much, but I need something. She was broke too, so my gifts were stuff like socks, I'm pretty sure her last gift to me were black socks with orange anchors on them because I was in the coast guard at the time. Black socks were part of the uniform, the orange anchors were technically against uniform regs...but no one saw the anchors at the bottom of my boot. 

&amp;#x200B;

This rant would've been even more depressing and self-loathing, but my cat is laying at the end of my keyboard being adorable. She's my only light left in the darkness, but she's been missing jumps more and more, she's having tear duct issues, and last time I went to a vet they said she's developing early stages of kidney problems. I know my only bit of light that's left isn't going to be around much longer and it fucking kills me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate this world, I hate my life, I hate myself."

1741,feeling unmotivated all the time,"hello guys, I'm honestly so miserable and hopeless and I don't know how to cope with this horrible feeling of void and no motivation at all. I've been feeling that way for a couple of months now. My everyday life is just a repetitive cycle of going to school, not studying at all and laying in bed for the rest of the day. I am really trying to overcome it and do at least something productive but I always end up doing absolutely nothing. I'm graduating from high school in a few months, I want to go to the university but I literally can't do anything for it, I can't study or focus on my responsibilities..all I care about are the days when I hang out with my friends and escape from the reality for a while. I know, all of this may seem kind of childish or not that bad but I'm starting to get worried that I wouldn't be able to get myself up and actually do something for my future and care about my responsibilities. I don't have enough strength and hope. Please, guys, is there someone who maybe feel or have felt the similar way and could share your ""story""? I would appreciate it with all my heart because I feel like knowing that maybe someone could get over it would give me some hope &lt;3"
1742,I thought I was over depression but I now realise I was just ignoring it all along,"Title says it all pretty much

At the end of summer I decided I was going to change my life, and for a while now I have actually been improving myself. I lost some weight, started making friends and even got really close with a girl.

I convinced myself that that was what I wanted and that I was happy but every single day I had that funny feeling in the back of my head just stoping me from actually feeling happy.

Today, it dawned on me that the only thing that kept me going is my friends, and I love then for that but it's not the same being happy to not being sad.

What can I do to actually improve my life?"
1743,Seeing the consequences of my actions paralyzes me.,"Saying sorry is never going to fix it. No action can ever make things right. Maybe the isolating feeling and guilt is just my penance. I don't want to do anything anymore. I've been in bed for almost 2 months straight. Failing and disappointing myself and those around me is more terrifying than literally wasting away doing nothing. 

Is it so bad that I'd like to just sleep it all away and bother no one again? Or see the things that can't be restored become better anyway?

Not sure what I'm saying here. All I know is I sincerely hope I don't make the year."
1744,I need help.,"I think I've had 'down phases' pretty regulary for the past few years now. As in, I'm feeling untypically down, unmotivated and so on. Recently I've noticed that I have uncontrollable pretty extreme mood swings. One second I'm feeling FINE and the next I'm in 'suicidal-mood'. I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing at the moment is some type of Bipolar Disorder or cureable Depression. I'd like to be able to give what I'm feeling a label, because getting to know with what I'm dealing with should be the first step towards recovery or suitable help, right? Either way I do know that I need to get help, but I'm currently still working up the necessary courage to tell my family. 

Is someone able to help me out?

1745,"feeling extremely lonely and sad on special days like birthday, new year day, graduation day and etc","I feel extremely sad on those days that I want to spend the all day sleeping so I don’t have to communicate with someone.. I always feel like a shit on my birthdays and cry for hours.. At my graduation my grandparents didn’t come for no reason, my parents said it’s so boring and they had a rush for leaving.. When I saw all those flowers and balloons idk some parents are really happy and proud, their support is so clear.. On the new year celebrations I always stay at home and feeling annoyed.. Nobody invites me to any plan and I have no one to make a plan.. 
I will be married soon and I am not sure if I have any real friend to share those moments with (: it really hurts.. I know I don’t have many, I know I am an introvert but at one point I am really a good person and I don’t deserve to felt like a shit.. Those people are really love me or not? Did I spend all my time and effort for the people who really don’t give a fuck about me? I want the offer to be on snow and there is not any in my city now so he asked to go a near one with snow, we can rent a cottage spend the evening with our best ones maybe some wine in front of fireplace.. He asked his friends and they are ready, guess about mine? 1/4 thank to god and one of the 4 is my sister! one of my friend has shift at weekend, the other one is preparing for an exam on January. She said the date is wrong! excuse me, this is one of my special moments and if you care you could think a way to be a part of this!

1746,My first poem,"Theres a voice in my head,

Its never gonna stop talking,

It will leave me when i die,

And i havent died yet,

I keep trying,

Day in day out,

Life in life out,

Its in there,

Filling me with doubt,

I get a glimpse of peace,

When the knife hits my wrist,

But everyday i need to go deeper,

Everyday it pulls me further into the shadows,

Am i alone?

Is this my fault?

Do i deserve to live?

Memories are fading,

Im just waiting,

Waiting till the bleeding stops,

Waiting for my friends to leave me,

As life gets colder,

The knife gets warmer,

Until i take the last step,

To feel the heat,

One last time."
1747,Im 19 and feel like nothing is worth doing,"Im 19 year old male

I will make it short and to the point.

First of all i honestly dont even know why i struggle with this because my life or childhood doesnt seem that bad. One half of me thinks im right to be sad or angry and the other thinks im just spoiled and weak.

My parents always yelled at eachother when i was a kid, my brother grew up fine despite us having basically the same childhood. My fathers drunken shouting was so engraved into my brain i know i will never forget it. So now when literally anyone raises their voice i cant stand it get so angry my instinct is to immediately cover my ears.

Then later in life i discovered i had development issues or i was ''slow''. My childhood was average-ish because at the time i didnt really understand that my family was falling apart since i was a kid. Around 6th grade is where everything fell apart, all the realisations suddenly jumped out at me. I realised i was stupid and slow, that my family is garbage etc.

I remember all my teachers desperately trying to reach out to me, to help me in any way because they knew something was fucked up in my life. But like an idiot i didnt care and pushed them away. The image of my english teacher giving me basically a  1 on 1 speech on life with almost tears in her eyes i will always remember.

&amp;#x200B;

Today: i am perpetually in a state of gut wrenching anxiety and stress. Days. weeks and months feel the and i can never tell if a week has passed or a year. I can be at home in my room alone and with nothing to do or worry about, yet theres always that knot in my stomach demanding that i worry about something.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like im in a permanent mixture of being boiling angry and sad confusion for the past 5 or more years.

I cant even tell anymore if im just a piece of shit or do i genuinely have problems."
1749,Void,"My heart was burning before because life sucks and it was too painful.

A Heart full of emptiness and a bit of loneliness"
1751,I Hate Myself So Much It Hurts,Im 18 F and spent all of my teen years depresssed. I feel so out of touch with people my age. That i missed out on the time where everybody finds out who they are. I dont have any friends i only leave my house to go to school and i cant do so many basic things. Like talk to a cashier or go to the gp on my own. Or order my own food or even ask my teachera for help during lessons. I dont enjoy anything and never had any interests or hobbies as far as i can remember. And even if the anxiety and depression can be sorted the autism with me for life. My heads so fucked up and nobody can help me so why bother with anything
1752,I feel like giving up,"I just realize how depressing my life is. I lost all my friends, I’m soon going to lose my whole family. I’m soon going to be homeless. I realized how all my life I was raised in a strict household. I had no social life what’s so ever. Everything about me is depressing. It’s sad how I see other people and there life seem way better than mines. I can’t believe that I allow my mental illness to control my life. I honestly feel like giving up."
1753,I feel like I’m going to relapse again,"I’m sure you guys are tired of reading my shit, but I just need to get this off my chest. As the title reads, I really feel like I am, and this scares me. I don’t want to. I was doing good for a while. My finals are tomorrow, and that’s one thing. The biggest issue right now, is whether or not I pass and get my cert, I’m more than likely going to be homeless. I’m embarrassed to say that I still live at home. I help out financially. But with the little amount I make, I don’t have money to save up. I’m paying off debt right now.  Here’s the thing. We live in a house for rent and our landlady will not let us ha e anymore dogs. We have two, that she was reluctant about in the beginning. My mom, who makes maybe as much as I do, thinks breeding dogs is going to help bring money in. ITS NOT A STEADY INCOME! However, if I were to pass this EMT course, that would help. I tried explaining to my mom all this. She won’t fucking listen. Plus I have two younger sisters who, after high school, want to go to college. My mom wants to move into fucking podunk and out of the city. She wants to buy this dog ASAP, so she can get a jumpstart on breeding it, so she can save up. I don’t have a car, so I’m fucked if that happens. I can’t live with anyone else, and I feel like I don’t have enough even to have a roommate. What I’m about to do it just leave town and start fresh. I don’t want to choose the alternative (I almost did a few times), and I have nothing here keeping me, so why not just leave this shithole? I don’t care how many miles I’ll walk, as long as I don’t deal with family’s problems anymore. If I don’t pass and I’m stuck at my dead end job, I swear this time, I am decorating the bathroom at work with blood and brain matter."
1754,It is what it is,"One of the ways I learnt to cope with how I feel was to accept that life is what is it is : It's unfair, people screw each other over all the time and it's just a mess no matter how good you try to be positive. Having said that I accept life as it is, learn from it all and try my best to keep moving forward &lt;3"
1755,Do antidepressants work?,"All of my experience with antidepressants don’t seem to help me in the way I want them to. They give me that, “I don’t care” attitude but that only seems to make my situation worse. Self medicating with marijuana helps but I also find more cons than pros in terms of functionality. Where can I go from here?"
1756,Confused,Is it weird that I get depressed over things that are normal in life. Like I’m depressed because I have bills to pay and other things that I have to pay for. Either way I’m going to have to pay it and everyone has responsibilities. but why does it depress me but some people can just be like “oh well this is what I have to do” and be okay with it?
1757,A good day ruined by bullies,"Not really in a mood to write a long story about the situation and my feelings, just want to put this out somewhere somehow. 

Overheard the rich mean girl annoying princess squad talking mean things about me today. I was having one of the best days in a while, feeling good and laughing genuinely again. Hearing them really put my confidence down again. Currently it is nighttime and i can't sleep for the comments are still echoing in my head and giving me anxiety. My best friend heard the bullies talking about me today as well, she just texted me if I am still upset about them - really grateful for I feel like she cares about me. I wish I could just forget about the mean people at school and just exist."
1758,You ever feel like you need extra love every once in a while?,Like maybe a hug that lasts just a few seconds longer or a day that’s just about you. A day where you don’t have to cook or clean or think.

How do people still upvote this shit?"
1760,Pharmacy accidentally charged insurance for my meds,"Mom texts me today: "" can you tell me why you take pills for crazy people?""

Because I'm depressed. 

""why are you depressed. You have food. Water, friends, a home, we pay for your school. You have everything, you don't need this crazy drug.""

All this right in the middle of finals. Fuck."
1761,Does it automatically go on ur record if visiting a doctor?,"I need someone to talk to about my conditionn, but I’m also working towards a career that I may have to give up on if diagnosed with depression or any mental illness. Is it possible to just go in for a checkup and have a talk, ask them to not put it on official record? Or are there any other ways I can try to cope with my depression and anxiety?"
1762,I hate myself.,"I don’t know if anyone else feels this way, but I just feel like I’m never enough. I just can’t be satisfied with myself. No matter what I do or how well I do it, I just can’t feel satisfied. For example, I spent around 5 years of my life playing a first person shooter, and I eventually reached top500 globally at one point, but I just couldn’t feel satisfied. 

I want to be the best at everything I do, but I just can’t, and I fucking hate myself for it. I just feel so empty and I hate it, because no matter what I do, I can’t get rid of this feeling. And can’t understand how others can look so happy with themselves. When I see someone, I just see how pathetic and useless they are, just like me, but they’re somehow happy. It feels like I’m missing something and it’s driving me crazy."
1763,How do I get into the Christmas spirit if I'm depressed,"Christmas is approaching and eveyone around me is filled with enjoy and excitement. For those people Christmas is such a happy time and they all love listening to Christmas carols and celebrating all the festivities. I on the other hand do not really care for Christmas, and I'm no happier around this time than any other time of the year. I was wondering (for the sake of those around me) how I could enjoy this time and become more festive. 

I also have issues eating around people and just eating in general, so Christmas is also difficult for me in that sense which only makes me feel more depressed."
1764,Just in case nobody has told you today.,"You’re a unique fucking snowflake and very special, so special in fact YOU are 1 and almost 8 billion people in this world. You are loved, Keep it up and stay excellent!"
1765,Do you ever just get so mad at yourself,"I’m mad that I want to do so much but I can’t. I spend time imagining what I want my life to be like, but then I don’t do anything about it."
1766,Everything suuuuuuuucks,"I just can’t catch a break. The last couple months have just been awful. It really feels like I’m completely hopeless. I spent all last week interviewing and 2nd interviewing for a couple jobs that I was actually interested in. They all went really well and I was sure at least one of them would hire me. Well you probably see where this is going. Friday, they both turned me down almost simultaneously. I just feel completely crushed. On top of that, my emotions about people are all over the place and I don’t know why I feel like I need someone to live for. Why can’t I just care about myself? It feels like I’m turning to stone from the inside out. My chest feels so heavy..."
1767,I hate Christmas 🌲,"Stop celebrating please, I feel even more alien.

1770,It just feels like the universe is out to get me.,"I have struggled with depression for years. But I am able to find peace in routine. Having and completing a routine provides me with even a small feeling of accomplishment.

So, part of this is having a cup of coffee with milk and sugar when I wake up. But today, I was feeling really down and didn't get out of bed for a while. Finally, I decide I don't want to be miserable all day go to get my coffee. I pour the coffee and go to get the sugar when I realize, I'm out. I thought there was another bag somewhere, I looked everywhere and couldn't find it. Both my parents are at work, so there's nothing I can do. All there is is an old bag that got ants in it. Now, it's a 50-pound bag that we've kept in a bin. It doesn't have a ton of ants, but enough that it's hard to get some sugar without a few ants.

So here I am, trying to pick ants out of my sugar so I can have my, now cold, cup of coffee. Because I can't drink it without some sugar and I need it to have a functional day. It's pathetic. My day shouldn't hang on being able to complete this first step in my routine. But at the same time, why can't I just have some coffee without all this trouble?"

I have been on school break lately which I was looking forward to for such a long time but for the past couple weeks I have been feeling so dull.  It wasn’t like this the first 2 weeks of my school break. i rested and basically binge watched Netflix with my dog. It felt amazing, 

I originally thought it was because I was bored so I started to learn web development which I had been wanting to do for a long time, I even started to workout and improve my self image, I have been reading, etc, I have been keeping myself busy so that I wouldn’t feel this way.

I don’t have cabin fever because I regularly leave the house to go to the mall with my family or just my mom. 

I just feel like all feelings of enjoyment have faded away. I have even started to lose physical attractions. Also for some reason I always want to cry at the smallest things.

This all just started out of no where and I don’t know what has been happening. 

Thanks for reading!"
1773,I'm not sure if im getting better or worse,"I've been battelling depression for over 8 years. It's a long story so I'll say what's been the latest. I've done two suicide attempts and failed. Since then I started with antidepressants, I did get on better. I got on a new course and finished it after a year but during that time its been a rollercoaster for my mind. sometimes I felt worse than before and other times like nothing had happened at all. I haven't been to school for 2 months. My sense of time is slipping. I can't sleep properly. every week I have only 2 days where I sleep over 8 hours and the rest less than 4. I don't want to be this way. All that keeps me from this is the games I play. but I don't enjoy them anymore either. I've been trying to convince myself to go to a doctor for 3 weeks and am finally going tomorrow. I hope. I usually fail going there too. I'm not worthy of the society I live in. Why cant i just disappear. I don't really want to talk. I'm so tired of people. Why cant they just leave me alone?"
1775,I'm depressed...should I even bother dating?,"I fear not committing long term, or not feeling worth dating."
1776,I feel like I'm constantly close to having a mental breakdown,I have so anxiety and I'm so depressed lately.  It just feels like I'm going to breakdown any moment now especially when I lack sleep.
1777,I hurt myself for the first time today,Got some news that pushed me over the edge. Can’t see a way out
1778,I feel so goddamn lonely,"Hey guys,
I am lonely. I think that nobody cares about me. When I meet up with friends, most of the time I´m the one who hast to initiate meet ups to see people. When I don´t text them, they won´t text me. That´s why I get the feeling that nobody is interested in me. A friend of mine told me that people avoid me because of my sad vibes, my bad posture and my sad voice. I don´t know what to do. I wish I could be like Eckhart Tolle and accept everything and create a adequate distance to it. But I feel so fucking lonely. And of course the women aren´t also interested in me. I´ve tried so many things, but whenever the loneliness is too strong I get suicidal thoughts. ( I won´t do anything to myself. I just hate the suicidal thoughts)"
1779,Stop pretending you know that everything is gonna be okay,"I am tired of people telling me “it’s gonna be okay”. You don’t know that my life is gonna improve. It could all be downhill from here, which is probably the case. Stop acting like you know."
1780,"I'm sorry, but what am I supposed to do ?","(I know post is a little long, but please read, I need help)

I had my first therapy session yesterday and tbh I don't feel much better, I cried a lot during the session and I'm still crying. it doesn't change much.

All my posts have been sort of aggressive coz I want to do something against body shaming men and specifically dick shaming. So... I just want to talk about the insecure side of mine.

I've been totally into books, porn and video games for 20 years of my life (never thought about relationships and girls). And I belong to a country where this is the ""normal"". Our parents expect us to be this way and have arranged marriage at the end. So yeah I am not weird just for this. Though I had a lot of friends who fell into love and relationships during school/college life, I always thought of em as stupid and that they were wasting their time.

So here is the thing, now i want to may be try and be in a relationship (tbh I want to rather explore sex) but: I HAVE A SMALL PENIS (4.5"" and thin) AND IT FEELS LIKE KILLING MYSELF.

&amp;#x200B;

* I've always been a guy who talked like relationships are sh#t and I would rather utilize my time for doing important things or playing games. So it's tough for me to admit that I NEED LOVE. It's like a battle inside my mind.
* I feel sad about my size because no matter what, I can't change it and with this size, I know am below average, so PIV won't be a good experience for me.
* Every time I read women expressing how good PIV makes them feel and all, it makes me want to scratch myself.
* All the places are always filled with ""Big dick"", ""bigger is better"", men boasting about their size and women replying positively. Women expressing how good their experience with a big (not monstrous) dick was.
* I go to big dick forums and I find happiness everywhere and success stories, I go to a smal dick forum and I find suicide fuel.
* I tried to go for ""gone wild"" groups of the city where I live, on reddit and all the stories are just about men showing off their big dicks or videos/images with big ones and girls enjoying them, the only image I found where a guy (which might have taken him some courage) posted a small dick picture, he was mocked in comments.
* Whenever there are threads about what is the smallest dick you have seen? Women explain their encounters with guys like me and most of them don't go well and then people even make fun of us... I just want you to know. I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY NOT INTEND TO HURT, OR MAY BE YOU CAN'T RELATE OR UNDERSTAND WHY IT SHOULD, BUT IT HURTS SO BAD!!! it just makes me feel like I should've stayed the way I was, it.. I dunnoo... it sucks to hear that, no matter if it's the reality, it f##ing hurts.
* I talk to a redditor regularly who helps me get rid of my suicidal thoughts, and few days ago we were discussing things that turn me on (since I haven't explored my kinks, of course and I know less about what things that happen in real world and what stays just in porn world)...... So , yeah, turns out am into ""role-reversal"" or ""gentle femdom"" or similar thing (without the slave or pet thing, just caring/loving and teasing and all) but I live at a place where people know nothing about sex coz sex is almost never discussed. So how am I supposed to try those thing out if I ever manage to get over my insecurities? I won't be able to find a partner who is into those things (That's the reason I explored the gone wild groups).
* (My entire post history is on this topic so, please don't debate over this here ). After all this, I am the butt of joke everywhere , there are songs ridiculing my body, there are advertisements and many bad traits or behaviour are linked to ""small penis"", just to make the guy who did that feel bad. But my question is: DOES THE SOCIETY EVER THINK ABOUT ME? You used small penis to shame a guy who did something terrible.. so well, do they once, just once think about guys who have it , before saying that? Rather it is always defended by some cause like ""it is to stop rash driving"", ""because president did bad things"", ""because pop culture was shaming women""... but what's my fault in that? We didn't do anything wrong :'( why is small dick being used to shame them? and they know what their size is so that insult did nothing but shamed us/me coz it is a symbol of shame as used in those ads/songs/situations. So that makes me extremely sad and insecure.

I want to see that happy/amazed look on my partner's face as well, I want to satisfy them or make them orgasm multiple times even if I don't, I want them to want me the way I read the wanting guys with big organs, I want them to feel the lust for me as well. But I have a small organ and I can't help it. I wanted to do those ""wild things"" as well. I've never tried and talked to a woman, but after all that I've seen and I see everyday, How am I supposed to even try? specially when I want to explore sex first rather than going for a relationship (which I sure want to in near future coz, like I said, i need to feel ""love"" may be, it's something I've never felt but surely sound great).

So, yeah! What should i do?

A Request: I know it's mostly jokes, it's not meant that way, people have a sense of humour for it. But please before dick shaming someone or cracking a small dick joke, please do consider this, that he might have all these things in his brain as well, he might get deeply hurt and still smile in front of you. He might be so insecure, sad and frustrated (frustrated of the last point) that he needs therapy. So, yeah it... sucks to know that the feeling that people talk about all the time, the thing that majority of humans crave the most apparently, is something I won't be able to experience the same way, and on top of that there are enough things to convince me that society sees it as something shameful to have."
1781,Is it so wrong to want to die on your own terms,Honestly I just want to be done with this life I'm trying so hard but it's just mentally exhausting not being able to just live and enjoy life like a normal person it just doesn't seem worth it anymore having a mental illness is worse than anything if you're physically sick people cut you a break if you're mentally unwell people just toss you to the side I have no one to lean on no one to help not even a shoulder to cry on I'm trying so hard to fix my mistakes work on my issues and get on my feet but at the moment I dont see a reason why life is just so hard too hard and I have no reason to keep fighting and no way to end it peacefully so I guess I'm meant to struggle through the rest of my life miserable I want to be happy I want to live a fulfilling life I just dont know if that's possible sorry I guess I just wanted to vent
1782,Mothers in Hospital,"Feels like everything is falling apart.. i won't be seeing my mother at the christmas markets this christmas, she's gotten more sick and has to have blood transfusions at the hospital, she's constantly tired and we're worried she won't be around much longer...

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost my appetite entirely.. i feel lost, alone and like i am about to lose a large part of my life.."
1783,I don't no why,I want to end my life and it  feel likes I dont have a reason to  do it. My sister was diagnose with cancer and she was abused as a chiled - why  shoud I care about my own life? There  are people out there who actually need help. I feel pathetic.
1784,I'm the least successful person in my family and I feel like a fraud,"Literally all but one of my cousins who live in America are studying to become or have already become doctors or nurses. The one cousin of mine who isn't a doctor or nurse is some rich millionaire banker. The majority of my aunts and uncles are doctors or nurses too... and then there's me. I'm a bunch of wasted potential and the worst part is, most of my family don't even realize that. I've always been very vocal about not wanting to have any sort of medical profession. Some of my uncles and aunts make me out to be this genius writer to overcompensate for that when I never fucking wanted that. They literally keep on bringing up poems I wrote in MIDDLE SCHOOL in which I used the thesaurus thing on Microsoft to use big words as evidence that I'm some great writer. I literally always fucking tell them not to be impressed I used big words when I just used that thesaurus Microsoft feature, but they don't get it. If I'm not exceptional at something, I'm nothing to them. I used to have a passion for writing, until I turned 15. That's when I think my depression started. I was officially diagnosed with depression at age 17 and I'm 20 now. I was never studious or hard working since high school started, and they don't know that. I didn't have all As and Bs, I barely passed. I have no passion for anything and only went along with getting an English major because I thought I'm naturally good at it, but I'm not. I'm still in community college and just now decided to change my major to become a therapist which is funny because I'm the one who needs therapy. I was somewhat content living this dead-end lifestyle of taking only two classes a semester at community college even though how behind in life I am compared to my same age to barely older cousins scared the shit out of me, until my dad commit suicide a few months ago. Suddenly, I had all this extra pressure on me. All my life I avoided my family because I didn't like how fake and strict they are and I don't know I've always just been asocial and my cousins didn't like me so I just didn't go. I avoided two uncles of mine and their families for two straight years because of how they treated me after I was raped until my dad killed himself and that was the first time I saw them again. Because they would always be at major family functions that I would avoid I barely saw my entire family until he killed himself. I still haven't forgiven them for what they have done and I hate that I have to smile and pretend like things are okay with them. Being around them has just made me more depressed because they all look down on me and blame me for my dad's suicide which is understandable but I won't get into that right now. Throughout high school I didn't bother to try because I thought I have no future and that I would kill myself by 18 anyway. Well I'm too cowardly to kill myself because I'm afraid of the physical pain and surviving the attempt. Where I live, you have to be 21 to get a gun and you can't get a gun if you have been forcibly institutionalized so I don't want to try now, fail, and then be unable to end my life the easy way: shooting myself in the head. It takes so much out of me to do one thing. I have so many horrific problems outside of my father's suicide before and after his death. I never learned to drive or had a real job and then he killed himself and the family including my mother and brother blame me (it's a long story). I have my permit now and have been getting driving lessons with my uncle and I was so proud of that. But then my mom broke down about me not having a job and about how I'll become homeless or dependent on family members that despise me and think I'm trash for being an atheist with a boyfriend among other things. I was feeling like I was finally improving but now I think there's no point anyway because I'll always be lazy, miserable useless worthless trash. I applied for two jobs I didn't get and I'll apply for more but it's so hard when I've been a depressed, lonely useless loser for so long. I need to drive so I can take my brother to school so my mom can work full time again. She thinks my brother who's 16 is too good for the bus so she got a part time job that's not enough to pay our bills just so she can drive him to school in the morning. She screamed at me when I suggested he just take the bus saying that's what homeless beggars do. So now we're going to financially struggle and it's all my fault because I had a stupid phobia of driving for so long and my dad always did it until he couldn't because he's dead. There's so much wrong with my life and most of it is my fault. I need therapy but I can't ask my mom because whenever I ask her for anything she talks about how it's my fault my dad killed himself and it's my fault we're struggling and that I'm going to end up dependent on family who think I'm trash and that there's no way she's going to do anything for me. Whenever she is remotely upset about anything, she somehow makes it about how I basically murdered my dad who commit suicide. I feel like I was born to fail. My dad was depressed and psychotic and attempted suicide when I was 10. He felt useless for being unable to get a well paying job and for the past 10 years he was mostly unemployed except for Lyft driving in the last year before he killed himself. I was just set up for failure. The rest of my cousins had stable parents and here I am, the black sheep. I hate how everyone makes the stupidest reasons for why I am the way I am, too. They blame it on me not being religious or whatever when I know it's not true and it just adds to my endless stress."
1785,When depression is less like the flu and more like a head cold,"Coming from a season of crippling depression is so hard. When depression is the worst, family and friends understand more. The pain is so evident and present that they can’t really look away or ignore it. 
I’ve been feeling better but it’s still hard to do certain things, like socialize or push myself to go out and attend events. This resulted in a huge fight between my fiancée and I about a holiday party. I was feeling like garbage and couldn’t bring myself to go even though I had been looking forward to wearing my red Christmas dress, getting fancy, and spending time with him and his family. He went without me. I told him I wanted to go but I was having a hard time. He said he understood but obviously he did not. He told me it was ok to not want to go. That wasn’t at all what I meant. And all of this, not going, the fighting, him grabbing a drink and getting wasted with a female friend while I sat at home, is such a hit to my self-esteem. I feel like I’m sliding back again. I wish more people understood what a constant battle it is."
1786,my depression... went away?,"i'm not really sure what happened. for months i felt awful, just go through my post history if you want proof. i was constantly thinking of killing myself and actually sought out ways to do so.

then i started university.

i'd been so scared the sudden change of environment would make me feel worse, but it didn't. i felt more relaxed and became more outgoing and cheerful. of course, i still had more dark moments but they never lasted long, and i'm honestly flabbergasted.

i guess i'm happy but i'm still sort of confused."
1787,Life sucks,I'm 26 years old and I'm single . But I like to be marry to some (women) now I need to talk someone.  I don't have job don't like to go. I can't take decision. How can change my life.
1789,Anyone else feels like their depression is gone recently,I feel strange: happy although I’ve been depressed and suicidal a week ago. What the hell happened
1790,"I'm what my father would refer to as ""a waste of oxygen""","This is gonna be absolutely incoherent. I'm crying and just relapsed in self-harm. 

I'm absolutely worthless.

I've failed so many college classes over the course of the years. I'm not on any kind of graduation schedule. I doubt I'll even graduate. I can't even get myself to go to my classes half of the time, so I do poorly just because of attendance. I want to want to make something of my life, but I can't even convince myself that there's any point to any of this. 

I feel like I'm letting everyone done. Graduating with good grades has always been very important to my dad. I can't talk to him about anything. I've been telling him that I'm depressed for 10+ years now and every time he tells me to get over myself. 

My boyfriend wants me to do well and also be happy. And I know if I graduate and find a job that isn't just restaurant bullshit, then maybe I'll finally be happy because my life might have some meaning. But I just can't seem to get there. I can't. All my energy is spent trying to stay alive that there's no energy left to move forward with life. I wanna just drop out, but I know that won't make me feel any better because I'll still be stuck working meaningless jobs with absolutely no direction in my life. I'll feel the same. 

Up until now, I've kept myself alive by going to a bunch of rock concerts. I've told myself that I can't die yet because I've got to see this band still. And that's worked really well for a while. But right now, not so much. It's just a distraction. And distracting yourself seems to be the Internet's advice for dealing with negative emotions. But I constantly feel negative emotions, so I'm always finding ways to distract myself. So nothing gets done. No actual ""living"" happens. 

I'm gonna seek out help from a therapist soon. The college counseling services, while I'm glad they exist, aren't enough for me. But I have to wait til after the first of the year for my insurance to be active. And that's weeks away. 

I'm sorry this post is a mess. I just have no one to talk to and I'm trying to minimize my self-harm relapse. I have no friends. I talk to my boyfriend about my feelings a lot, and he's always been very supportive. But I feel like I'm pushing it. I feel like he's gonna get fed up one day. I wouldn't blame him. I'm kind of an emotional leech. 

I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. I'm fed up with me. I wish I could go back to when I was 20 and start over. I wish I hadn't let depression control my life so much. At 26, I feel like I've messed up too much and my life is already over."
1791,Shitpost,No I'm not depressed! *sniff checks leggings and puts them on for the 4th day in a row to rewatch bojack horseman AGAIN*
1792,I've pissed everyone off and have to spend Christmas alone,"I've  been trying so hard to be in the holiday spirit and make the most of it all, but that's not going so well. I made the mistake of upsetting my parents to the point my mom hasn't spoken to me in almost a  month.  Ive tried apologizing but have had no luck. Our relationship has always been a little rocky so this really should come as no surprise. It just hurts a little more when this is meant to be a happy time of the year. I only have one other family member close by, but  they are pretty toxic and someone I choose not associate with unless I have to. My husband works Christmas eve and the day after Christmas so no possibility of going anywhere. It seems like I've upset him as well so that's fun. No friends close by I could visit either.  I've always enjoyed getting together with family and friends, baking goodies, playing games, or even just watching Christmas movies. Each year I try to make everyone's gifts instead of just buying them. This year i don't even see the point.  I feel like I've burned every bridge and I'm just kind of loosing hope. No friends, no family.This isn't how i wanted the holidays to go. This isn't how I want to start the new year. If this were a movie this would be the part where things start to turn around. Sadly i don't see that happening anytime soon.  I know I'm throwing myself a pity party, I just don't know what else to do anymore. I just want something to go right."
1793,A snow-bound Sisyphus,"I feel like that everything around me is a slow struggle to keep things going. The new anxiety/depression I'm on makes me  angry and brain foggy, my workplace has me on review pending a ""notable improvement"" in my work output, I'm in a considerable amount of debt, and my relationship with my girlfriend feels like it's strained to the breaking point.

I don't feel like I want to take drastic actions in any way, shape, or form, since I usually enjoy life and the thrill of living itself. But everything just feels like I'm slowly making my way through one snowdrift after another, constantly straining to take large steps to keep moving forward.

How do you handle this feeling? Am I losing my sense of reality in amongst everything else going on?"
1794,I really don't know what I'm doing,"Before I begin, I want to immediately apologize for my english, it is not my birth language and I want to apologize in advance if this text violates rules of the sub (I'm kinda new here).

I actually don't know why I am writing here. Maybe I just want to let it all out for once, because due to circumstances of my life I can't have such ""privillage"". And I have to admit, it really pisses me off, because sometimes I want to tell what I really feel to the people that are close to me, but I'm also affraid to tell it because of my previous experiences that didn't end well for me and I'm kinda still recovering from it, even tho it happened almost a year ago already. 
The main thing is that for a good 3-4 years I am suffering from depression (even tho I don't like to call it like that, everyone has stuff going on) and anxiety, can also admit some anger issues rose because of it but for now at least here I'm succesfully managing. But, probably, because of it I'm affraid to tell my opinion or feelings to others. About 1-2 years ago was I lucky to get into group of friends who were really nice to me like no one else in my life have ever been, but my ""condition"" started to kick in and take much bigger and bigger tool on me and my insanity until the point where I had to really deal with my anger issues, but it was too late because those friends wanted me out of their lifes. Probably because it was becoming a toxic relationship and I completely agree with and take the blame for it. But the guilt still doesn't erase the sadness of losing someone like that. Now, since then I got up on my feet and found new people in my life. And, as every ""stupid"" (reffering to only me) teenager, I started to like someone. This where the problem starts: due to me wanting to learn from my past mistakes I'm affraid to even feel something like that to other person because I know I will f*** it up somehow and even if I'm succesful to get close to that person, I got close before - and I f***** it up. Just seem to can't find the middle ground maybe and it really makes it unfortuned/sad.

Sorry, if my thoughts are a bit rocky and thank You for those who took time to read it!"
1795,I envy those dead inside,I still cry. I wish I could die inside. but I still feel.
1796,Any tips for making the good days last?,"I'm sure we all have bad (and very bad) days but sometimes it seems like things get better.  
  
I can occasionally get motivated and even start some completing tasks but I do know that it will end eventually and I'll go down the spiral once again. And after many cycles of this it's a very dreadful thought that you know you'll get worse but you don't know how to stop or at least delay it..  
  
How do you preserve the momentum? 
It feels like a faint light that needs to be nourished but idk how and I'm afraid it will not return one day"
1797,The 2020s better not be as shit as the 2010s,This decade was horrible. Hoping the next one is better.
1798,I just can't take it anymore,"This last week has been one of my toughest in a long time and I don't know if I can handle much more. A huge fight broke out in my class in which ended in one of them being unnecessarily racist to pretty much 98% of the class. All while this was happening I had to suppress my feelings of depression and anxiety of the fight in the class to help 2 people (one of which being my crush) through serious panic attacks. Then I had to cut like 5 people I thought were my friends because they turned out to be homophobic, narrow minded and just all around two faced assholes. On top of that, I've forced myself to come to terms with the fact that there is an almost certain chance that my crush doesn't like me back as she is asexual. In addition, I didn't get any grades for any of the assignments that I handed in and I have two of the most important exams of the entire course. I spent my entire weekend crying in bed because I was too depressed to do anything and then I had to deal with my mom shouting at me for not doing my chores because I was too depressed to get out of bed. Then again today she started making me feel like shit because I'm too stressed and depressed to handle college and work experience to take on a job and then she started giving me shit for it and then told me to ""cheer up"". To make matters worse, it is the anniversary of my grandma's death on wednesday. I just can't take my life anymore and I want it all to end. No matter what it takes. I can feel myself relapsing and I'm not sure how much longer I am able to fight the urge. I'm such a disappointment."
1799,Sports killing my drive,"So I’m a junior in high school and I joined wrestling so that I could get more fit. The coaches have been really hardcore and I get that that’s how it is. I haven’t really done sports before, so what’s it saying if I quit? But at the same time my grades have been slipping and my happiness has been replaced by dread. What should I do?"
1800,I’m driving myself insane trying to figure out romance.,"I’ve asked every question, tried ever angle. I can’t figure it out. Am I just a passing thought? Sometimes I face obsession, other times it’s apathy. I can’t figure it out. “What’s your type?” I don’t know. I’m too nervous to try. Or maybe just too shallow. I can’t help thinking I’m completely insane. I beg for help to the point where that’s all I’m seen for. Atleast I think. I mean, I was like that before. I liked talking to people, its the only escape I have, but I annoy people. I never agree, mostly because my ideology. I’m just too pessimistic. I wish I wasn’t, but if I lost my pessimism I’d have nothing left. All my writing, the thing that sparks passion in my life, is so depressing that no one will give me feed back, just empathy. I don’t want empathy, I don’t want to be told to wait. I want to find an answer! One of the best things I can do is map out the strange, the things people never could wrap their heads around. I wanted to start a blog about it, but it would be lost in the noise. If I could get a foothold on love, I could let everyone else in. But I can’t. I’m beginning to doubt that I have the mental fortitude for it. I hate being sacred. I just need to hookup. That’s the entrance into the rabbit hole. But I don’t know if I can. I wish I could, I wish someone would help me, someone nice. I don’t think nice and hookup often go together. I hate being told to wait, I hate being told I’m too young. Guys my age are the wheels of hookups, without them those stupid apps would never see the light of day. I’m just not one of them. I can never catch their eye. I tore myself down so I can build back up, but now I just keep resetting. I opened a door I can never close. All I want to do is talk, but I’m even bad at that. If I could find someone I could talk to, I’d be happy. Maybe that’s my type, talking. Dammit I just want to change. I’m leave my town, my state, spending half a year on the other side of the country. I’m leaving my small town, breaking my curse. Right? No, it’s my curse, it’s who I am. No pills can change that, no CBT. I want answers, real answers. I can find just about anything that’s out there. It’s what I’m good at. But love? Sex? Romance? These are the most popular subjects in the world, but I can’t even find scraps. I’m starving, I’m insane. I don’t care what I look like anymore, I just don’t want to be desperate again. I’m back on my medication, I’m losing the weight, I thought I had friends. I want to show my family that I’m my own black sheep. They think it’s a bad thing, but it’s all I’ve ever felt. Sex. I had sex once, pitty sex. Drunken pitty sex on a night out that took me months to plan. I don’t even remember how it felt, it lasted less than a minute. That’s why I need a hookup, so I can find that rabbit hole again. I just need to stop, I need to give up. Never give up. Give it up. Your too hard on yourself. You need to push harder. Why can’t anyone answer my questions? Have they lost all meaning? Are they just a Rosetta Stone of gibberish and self-destruction? I don’t need to talk to my family, they never help. I don’t need to talk to friends, they’ve done all they’ve can. Maybe there’s a monk out there with the answers. Probably not. I just wanted to rant."
1801,How do you motivate yourself enough to get out of bed?,"It takes me 2-4 hours to get out of bed because I just dread being alive. I can’t take it anymore. I have a list of “Reasons to Get Up” taped beside me bed and it does not help in the slightest. Drinking a full glass of water before going to bed has previously helped but for whatever reason I’ve been too apathetic to actually go get a glass of water before I go to bed. Working out in the morning used to be a reason for me to get up but I haven’t gone to the gym in a few weeks now. I only go if I manage to wake up before 6:30 and if I know I’ll eat enough during the day. One day I promised myself I’d make pancakes with a fuckton of legit whipped cream and maple syrup for breakfast and that worked but obviously it would not be a good idea to do that every day. 

Many comments on others posts about this advise to go for a walk, but it’s cold outside and walking is boring (music and podcasts do not help here.)

Considering the consequences of not getting out bed also does not help. Stress shuts me down.

Please give me any advice you have for getting out of bed."
1802,Idk how long I can do this,"I’m constantly scared for my safety I’m in a constant state of anxiety I’m afraid everyone will leave me and I have no future. I should die, it wouldn’t matter if I did"
1803,Loneliness is killing me.,"Unemployed, can't afford fancy hobbies, friends are all gone to join the rat race of life. May as well be living on my own, I live with two foreigners, with broken English, so it's a smile and nod situation, they talk amongst themselves, feel left out. Then I sit in my room for the day looking for work.

My family don't seem interested, we only meet once a week, feels kind of hollow, like they can't wait to separate again quickly.

Best friend and his wife are drifting away (wife is also my best friend) I always felt like the third wheel anyway. My usefulness will be outlived soon when they have their kid.

It's hard to be suicidal when I'm dead inside already. I think if I could just get a job and live with some nice sociable people (who understand english fluently) I'd feel much better."
1804,Depression is a piece of shit,I wish depression would just fuck off.
1805,"if i can barely force myself to take a shower once or twice a week, how do my parents expect me to have the energy to clean and organize my room","just need to vent. the title kinda says it all. my room just got progressively messier and more cluttered over the years especially since i started college and a new job. i can still walk to and reach everything and the stuff on the floor is off to the side so no one will trip on it. my parents insist that it needs to be cleaned and reorganized by the end of the year. they've been asking since the summer and i think they're starting to get fed up with me. i try to do a little at a time, but i'm so fucking exhausted and tired all the time. it makes me feel guilty that i can't just clean my damn room and i don't think they understand how little energy i have especially after coming home from work. i guess i will just try my best to force myself to not do anything else but clean today so they get off my back and i stop feeling guilty about this bs"
1806,please wake me up,
1807,I’m tired,"I’m tired of sucking at everything. I’m tired of not being interested in anything. I’m tired of feeling like a loser. I’m tired of not having energy. I’m tired of not finding joy in anything. I’m tired of not being able to stay in school or keep a job. I’m tired of not even being able to concentrate on anything, even a simple tv show. I’m tired of my stagnant ass life. I can barely get out of bed, let alone do basic tasks. I used to not be like this. The past 6 months have been absolute hell. I’m in therapy. I’m on medication. What can I do to get myself off my ass and feel alive again?"
1808,I don't try at anything anymore,"I'm so tired of failing, and never being enough even when I do try. So I've stopped, and I'm trying to get back to starting up again, but I can't. I have to take my permit test, and I can't even bother studying anymore. I just don't feel motivated to do anything anymore."
1809,unfair world,"hello i am feeling terribly melancholy today. everything good ever never happens to me blah blah blah. this dude i work with just found out that with the new PTO system at work he has an extra 50 hours to cash out RIGHT before christmas, and i immediately was jealous. You see my company completely FUCKED me over with my PTO because i was in a car accident so i missed a few days of work. I wanted to use my PTO for this and my supervisor conveniently forgot to put in the system...they basically said heres your earned money you asked for 3 weeks ago, and by the way we cashed out all your sick time, ( i only accrued like 16 hours because i was somewhat new when this had happened) so here you go. this was back in october and now when we transferred over to the new system my hours dropped so now i only have 3 accrued PTO hours.  i fucking hate this shit. i always feel like i can never catch up, nothing amazing never happens to me like that...again i know this sounds so cringey and prude. but i cant help the way im feeling right now. I didnt even give my coworker a chance in hell to see i was jealous, i really am happy for him i just wish stuff like that happened for me."
1810,Sleepwalking,"It feels as if I'm hazily floating through each moment and after tons of these moments add up I find that whole weeks or months have past without any change in my behavior, thought processes, or actions, and I can't remember the difference between day 1 and day 74. I don't feel emotion, and think about the last time I cried but can't remember when it was, although the last time I cried I told myself I'd remember, that that moment will be etched in my memory forever, and that I will never not look at myself or the world again. And yet here I am again. Stuck in the echo chamber of my mind with barely a thought my place or to the world around me. The only thing in my mind are the smallest anxieties of things I've done maniacally and now regret, or things ive just dont that I'm ashamed about. I can't look people in the eyes anymore. I find I can hardly look myself in the eyes when I look in the mirror.
I just don't want to live in such a heartless world.
I don't want to subject myself to a life of pure slavery.
I don't want to have to take meds or engage in endless, mindnumbing, distracting activities every single day to make everyday life more bearable.
But I guess just trying to learn to live with it all is the entire battle. 
Sorry for the long, ranty post, just wanted to get it off my chest and see if anyone shared the same sentiment"
1811,I'm really not happy with my life and I want to shave my head,"I'm in my ideal job but I'm not earning enough money. I live pay cheque to pay cheque and my new (used) cars contract was just terminated because of some issues. 
I'm not happy when I'm at work and when I come home I come back to my parents. I have no friends but I have a supportive boyfriend. 
My hair has been annoying me today and I really want to just cut it all off. I know that I'll regret it but the thoughts still there."
1812,Living is so painful,"Life is just shit... feels like everything that could go wrong went... and i just want to fucjing die... like the only reason i still didnt do it is because i have a close relative that would get her life completly screwed up if i killed myself but fuck i have living in pain around the idea i cant do that to her for years and i still do, but ye fuck its sucks so much... like there is just no reason for me to be alive... have nothing to go for, have nothing to lose and no will to live at all, but yeah it just feels bad, i undersrand that i should try hold on, but i am beyond that point i have came to the conclusion it just aint worth it, but yeah i guess i am stuck here...

Oh and dont get me wrong that person was by far the best that happened to me... just sucks that ye... you know... and sorry if this was poorly written and shit just needed to vent it out"
1813,What’s the point?,"Lets start off positive, I want to live. I love my family, I love my Girlfriend, &amp; I love my cat. However, simply being “alive” does not mean you are “living” I feel like I’ve been alive 23 years and have nothing to show for it. I don’t think I will ever make anything of myself. When I was younger I, like most of you had big dreams of success &amp; made promises to my family that I would take care of them as they aged. I don’t really know what’s wrong with me. But I haven’t been able to hold down a job in a long time. I had been unemployed (working food delivery) barely making ends meet. 

I finally decided to put more effort into my life and got a job with amazing benefits making 13.50/hr. I tired so hard to make it work but one day my mental sanity just failed and I couldn’t bring myself to even show up for work. Then due to my anxiety of showing up after I had been out 2 days I stopped showing up all together. Needless to say I’ve been fired. 

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for such a long time. It seems like no matter what I do I can never win. I am my own worst enemy. I feel more trapped then I ever have been, with bills coming up and no way to pay them. My family is aging and struggling to make ends meet as well.. Without them I feel like I won’t have a place in this world. I feel like a failure, to myself and the people I care about."
1814,You ever feel like the world just wasn't meant for certain people?,"A lot of people are able to graduate college in 4 years and have a job and just fool themselves into thinking that's a good life. Other people struggle to graduate or never do because it's too hard for them or they just dont see the point in it all.

Why do some people struggle so much but others excel with minimum effort? Why do some people give up while others haven't even thought about it?

I've been thinking that maybe the way the world works isnt meant for some people. I dont like most people, I dont like how superficial things are, how inconsiderate and selfish people are, how people dont think, how our education system is set up, how we have defined expectations for people, and the list goes on. Maybe I'm just a weak person but idk. I feel like some people could only be happy if they were able to do things that dont make money or dont fit societies norms so they spend their entire lives feeling ""off"" or like an outcast."
1815,I hate it when people make me feel like I am faking my depression,I am so tired of people calling me dramatic and people telling me that I want to feel this way. It makes me think that I really am just faking everything. I hate it.
1816,My attempts at overcoming depression always feel thwarted,"I just need to vent a little and I really would like some advice. I feel like God wants me to be depressed sometimes, and even though I KNOW that isn’t true that’s how I feel. I’ve had depression since before I had ever even heard the word depression. I spent years coping in my own way, alone before I realized what it was and then I got some help. I stopped going to my therapist of 3 years a few months ago. I had created habits that I felt could help me through the bad times I knew I would face again because my depression is one of the few constants in my life. I felt like I no longer had anything to gain from therapy. I’m going through a bout with it now and it has my confidence shaken. Before I felt like “I am just one of those people who has a chemical imbalance in some way. It’s completely normal and I have the tools to overcome it”. Now I feel like I didn’t do enough work to heal and overcome past traumas in therapy and I feel as though that fear has me reliving the past. Maybe the fact that I’m reliving the past at all is indeed indicative of the fact that I haven’t overcome things that I thought I had. Is my mind playing tricks on me?? I’m starting to get very paranoid about the realness of life also. I experience dissociation brought on by PTSD. I can’t connect with my memories. They seem so distant like they happened to a completely different person sometimes. It’s hard to put words together to make a complete sentence. I feel stupid and I know I didn’t used to be. I just can’t remember anything. Feeling like this is one of the things that keeps me constantly sad while feeling depressed now. They don’t always go hand in hand for me. I really could go on and on with it but I don’t want to bore anyone. I know I’m not alone. I know this will pass. I’m still doing the things I do when I’m having an up day even though I’m having down days right now. It’s so hard to find motivation. It’s hard to move and put one foot in front of the other. I guess that’s all I can do. One step at a time. I don’t even live in a legalized state and I stopped drinking a few months ago because it was really becoming a bad habit for me and alcoholism is close genetically so I don’t want to indulge. I don’t even know what questions I have. Don’t even know where to start and where to end. Just feeling completely overwhelmed. Sorry for rambling."
1817,I have been reading 12 rules for life: an antidote to chaos by Jordan Peterson and I don’t know how to feel,"I have been suffering from depression for a long time now, I actually don’t even when it started but I think it was sometime when I was 14, I am in my mid twenties now. I have always tried various things people have suggested from exercising to painting to dancing, sometimes they work, sometimes it just all feels really useless. As a suggestion from a friend, I started reading this book which basically gives you 12 rules to follow so that you can live a productive life and not let your depression or your mental state get the best of you. I have read 3 of them till now. When I am reading, I often feel like, ‘yes, this makes sense. I should follow this, I should teach my brain to think the way he talks in the book.’ But then once I have kept the book down I go back to feeling doomed and completely empty inside. I don’t know what I am trying to say in this post. I just needed to put my thoughts out and also wanted to know if anyone feels the same when they watch or read something that’s supposed to be helpful."
1818,Anyone else feel like they’ve ruined their life,"26 year old guy here, feel like I’ve already ruined my whole life and it kills me to think this will be my life. I didn’t go to a college due to not really having the money to afford it and me not really knowing what I wanted to do. I don’t have any skills, degrees, really anything that can help me get a better job. I work full time right now at a dead end job making slightly over the minimum wage. I’ve lost most of my friends due to not wanting to leave my apartment after getting home from work, I’m single don’t really have interest in a relationship cause I don’t have much to give to someone right now. Life has become a vicious cycle of being sad, tired, and frustrated. I’ve been trying not to use booze to cope but some days I do find myself drinking to take off the edge. I’m just so lost, confused and scared. If anyone reads this and has any advice please feel free to comment."
1819,It depressed me when I read about banks foreclosing on homes or about stuff about NASA.,"All the abandoned buildings and property we see could be set up to help homeless and people in poverty and America wouldn't be in poverty anymore. 

NASA spends billions of dollars to send a rover to another planet, instead those billions of dollars could be used and help thousands upon thousands of Americans out of debt, off the streets, giving them food, shelters, homes. The banks foreclose on homes and on property when they could take those properties give them to others in desperate need to live in. 

Old abandoned buildings like hospitals, etc could be fixed and opened into homeless shelters. The world would be much better than just putting a piece of equipment on other planets. WE should be focusing on this planet instead to make it better."
1821,I don't want to be a burden,"I'm a complete failure at everything I do, I can't stop disappointing the people I love and pushing them away. It's been 24 years, and I don't see a point in going forward."
1823,Stay positive everyone and enjoy life !,Hey everyone I just want to tell you all that life’s gonna be hard there’s gonna be ups and downs but no matter what you will make it through in life just keep a positive mindset and enjoy every moment in life ! 🙂
1824,Home for the holidays. Feel trapped.,"So.. This is a bit of a vent post because I just really have no idea what to do and it might help to have some outside opinions.

Backstory: I'm 19 and have really bad anxiety &amp; depression. I was a dog walker from age 11-18 but had never had my own dog. I was going to college in the fall and after completely freaking out about it, I decided to look into getting a dog. In January I adopted a 2 year old chocolate lab/pitbull mix from the humane society and she was perfect except for some occasional outbursts. She was good on walks, she chilled in my room while I was doing homework and was generally nice to take care of. But about 2 weeks after I got her she out of nowhere bit me in the face and I had to get several stitches. We called to make an appointment at the humane society to put her back up for adoption but they didn't tell us until we got there that they were going to put her down.

My depression got much much worse and I pretty much didn't get out of bed for a month. I was kind of manic and I realize now that this was a bad decision and tbh I can't believe my parents agreed, but I decided to get a goldendoodle puppy. The plan was to take a gap year to train him before going to go to college. 

I didn't realize until after I already had the puppy that taking a gap year would affect my financial aid so I couldn't do that after all. My mom agreed to take care of the puppy (Lucas) while I was at school. I still paid for all of his things and I have to come home during school breaks to give my mom a break.

The thing is, I learned a lot of things about myself during my first semester and I just... Don't think I make a very good dog owner. Because of the dog walking/housesitting I thought I somewhat knew what I was getting myself into but it's more different than I possibly could've imagined. The reason I got a dog in the first place is for emotional support and cuddles. Lucas doesn't even like being pet and hasn't cuddled since he was a puppy. He's always been very nippy and he's almost a year old now and still hasn't grown out of it. When he was a puppy we did EXTENSIVE training but we still can't even take him on walks because he jumps and bites us when he gets bored. Everything is so draining and I'm just having such a hard time right now. I feel like I've dug myself into a hole that I'll never get out of. And the thing is I LOVE Lucas so much!! I want the best for him. But I can't have him at college because he barks when anyone in the building moves around.

I feel like I can't do this anymore. I have no choice but to be home during the breaks but it's awful for me and my mental health. Me and my mom fight CONSTANTLY and I just feel so awful and worthless when I'm here. Any time I try to talk to my mom about how I'm feeling she takes it as an insult to herself and starts yelling at me. I can't take it anymore, I need to get out of here. I feel so trapped."
1825,Lifes going downhill. Might have to leave home.,"So i'm 17, currently transitioning from male to female, also an aspiring artist.  


For whatever reason my mom is very angry I don't want to finish high school (Already explained that art jobs want portfolios, not diplomas nor degrees), and i'm refusing to change this stance. School is only teaching me needless filler, and not helping me do what I actually want to. So I see no point in finishing. Besides, most low paying jobs don't even give a damn either way.  


But she's pretty adamant, and I get the feeling if I keep refusing she's going to kick me out. Even so I refuse to bend to it. I honestly don't know what I will do, but at this point I don't know how I feel. I don't feel like crying or screaming anymore, because i've already been doing that for so long. Its like I just don't care anymore. And i'm not sure what to do should I be kicked out. I don't know anyone outside that I can rely on.  


At times I feel like my mom really just doesn't believe in me. My sister told me she thought me wanting to transition was a ""phase"" (And sometimes it feels like she still thinks that), and she isn't encouraging me to practice my profession, but instead keeps trying to make me do things that are useless for it."
1826,I’m totally despondent at work,"My contract job expires Friday and I really don’t care about it haha.  I feel miserable and that this shit is just meaningless when you think about it.  Love isn’t real, it’s settling for somebody.  People talk shit and have negative comments and tbh I’m not much better either I just scroll on social media all day upset that I don’t have more followers or a more interesting life.  I’m not in a good place right now.  Rejection hurts too constantly having girls flake on dates to be with taller and cooler guys.  I try to workout, dress nice, and I think I look decent but I’m shy and that’s seen as a weakness.  I got hammered this weekend and I was talking to this girl at a party spilling my guts out and she was so nice about it and took the time to listen and didn’t judge now I regret a lot of the things I said to her but idk it was just nice having somebody listen."
1827,Anyone else have days when they just want to cry but physically can't?,Crying is really cathartic for me but I can't bring myself to do it anymore. Like right now I spent 30 minutes deliberately trying to bring myself to tears but I can't. It feels really fucking frustrating and it's kinda like a sneeze that doesn't want to come out. Anyone else relate with this?
1828,This decade has been a downward spiral for me and the nearest future isn't looking too bright either.,"I don't really feel like oversharing anything. Just want to put this out there, thanks 2010-2019 for completely destroying me yet still forcing my lifeless corpse to trudge along and keep moving forward towards an unknown oblivion. Cheers."
1829,wallowing vortex in my chest,"i’ve been depressed for years, mostly it flipping between that or intense anxiety. sometimes both, rarely neither. i'm taking a mental health today because the vortex in my chest will not leave. i feel umcomfortable in every position and the only thing that makes the vortex go away is thinking about my lovely boyfriend. i woke up this morning with an intense amount of negative thoughts. i feel guilty for not being happy."
1830,"For some reason, I can't help but be alone","About half a year ago, I started isolating myself from everyone I knew, despite being fully aware that this was a bad idea. I find that's a pretty typical pattern for me: the logical part of my brain can objectively assess the situation and come up with a reasonable (and usually positive) conclusion, but for some reason I just can't listen to that voice. When it gets bad, logic loses all meaning.

At any rate, after splitting myself from them, no one tried to reach out to me despite being aware that I was depressed and suicidal. I *could* contact them myself if I wanted, but it feels almost insulting. Why should I have to try and reconnect with them when I have abundant evidence that they don't give a shit?

I somewhat understand the lack of action, though (at least for some of them). My ex-gf wasn't capable of dealing with my depression, so she cut off all contact. I've heard other stories like that, too: ""You're unhappy and I can't make you happy, so I'm just going to leave"". It's a cold decision, but suppose it's a logical one. That doesn't justify it, though. Isn't it selfish to just decide that you can't do anything (especially when you haven't even done a whole lot)?"
1831,I'm trying to learn to be happy for people rather than immediately comparing their good fortune to my own situation,It's tough! But I'm trying.
1832,First post/first day taking antidepressants,"Hi there. This is my first time actually posting anything on here. I don’t feel comfortable telling people in my circle, but I felt you guys here would understand my nervousness. Today is my first day taking antidepressants. I was prescribed the pills a little while ago, but when I told the two closest people in my circle, they shot down the idea of them and kind of scared me. So I held off for awhile, but today is the day I actually made the decision to take them. I’m kind of nervous. I know I’ll definitely rewrite this post a ton of times before I actually post it, but I wanted to get this off of my chest. It’s been tough, and the holidays don’t really help. (aside from the pure light of Mariah Carey’s Christmas album, haha) 
Anyways, I’m just thankful that there’s a community like this that I can come to and find things that I relate to. And see that others still push on as well. Wishing you all the best. 
sorry for the long post! Wish me luck!"
1833,Barely hanging on,"Money is the cause of all my problems. My SO is going to leave me because I don't make enough. She wants a house and a family and I know ill never be able provide that for her and I under why she wants that and I wish so much that I could do that for her. 

I never made good decisions when I was younger. I'm 26 now and I make 15 an hour and i can seem to find anything better. I cant even afford to move out of my house that has no drinkable water as well as no HVAC.

I know this sounds like a sob story. I just need to let it out. I cant afford my medication for my Bipolar so things are getting hard. I just idk. I've attempted suicide about 5 times now each time botched. I know I am above that now. It just is starting to feel more like an option as everyday goes by. 

I feel stuck and terrible as well as terrified. As well as I feel like as I have no solution for these emotions and problems."
1835,How depression and anxiety feel (for me),"I’ve been dealing with depression for most of my life, and recently anxiety.

I just want to say that it is a terrible paradoxical feeling (how I feel it) because I always want to go back to my safe place where I can relax and do nothing because of my depression, but also I don’t feel safe or comfortable anywhere, not even at home because of my anxiety and shit relationship with my family.

It is a terrible feeling, because... what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to cope?

Just wanted to share this"
1836,Anyone else feel so hopeless and that they were destined to fail at life,"I feel like I was destined to not be good at anything. Destined to ruin things. Destined to have no friends, and to never be part of a friendship group. Destined to fail. Destined to always be struggling with money. Destined for disappointment. Destined to be a waste of time, a waste of oxygen, to not achieve anything. I have lost hope because I feel like this is how I was meant to be"
1837,I feel like a completely different person when I am depressed,"I don’t feel like me. Every once in awhile I will get a moment where I will be able to think clearly and I realize how much I have changed. I don’t know who I have become. I am irrational, judgmental, and overall I just feel like an asshole. I wish I could just be who I used to be."
1838,I feel unable to be truly invested in anything,"It feels like the part of my brain that is supposed to generate interest in things is just out of gas and has been my whole life. I have interests, but I have never ever really been motivated to delve into them as much as it seems healthy people do. I just don't find satisfaction in...anything. I enjoy doing my hobbies sorta but only to a point. And if I am honest it has been that way my whole life. I have only noticed this recently. 

It is really impacting my work life because my job is demanding and all my coworkers are motivated by their passion for our field, and I just...don't care. I am trying as hard as I can to force it but I can't help but feel like everything we do is pointless and this useless feeling is overriding my rational thoughts. 

This makes me feel so cut off from people. Our interests direct our experiences and our experiences define us. Because I have so little of each, I feel like a boring non-person. I try to force things but then it just comes off as disingenuous. I feel trapped inside a broken mind."
1839,Christmas gift from my coworker made me cry,"I rarely talk to anyone at work due to social anxiety and and years of depression constantly reminding me that I’m worthless and everyone hates me. So today my coworker, who I’m somewhat comfortable enough to say hi to in the morning, comes to my desk and he hands me a present. He then says “merry Christmas!”, and goes on his way. The gift had my name written on it and was wrapped in really nice sparkly wrapping paper. I haven’t even opened it yet, but just the fact that someone noticed my existence and took the effort to wrap a gift and write my name on it brought me to tears. I don’t even care if it’s a generic gift he gives to everyone, I’m just happy someone thought of me existing in the world for even a minute. It really helped me feel less lonely and worthless for today."
1840,Does someone experience the same thing ?,"Hi everyone.
M20 here 

A little background :
I've been feeling weird for about 3 years now. It started slowly with terrible brain fog in the morning, feeling drunk and out of my body.
I have always been anxious in the past but it was more manageable and I was still the happy, energetic kid. 


The problem is that since about 2 years, I am in the weirdest state of mind ever (and physically too). 
Mind : 

I feel really stuck in a loop and it feel like my life has been on hold for the past two years, every moments (even good moments) feel wasted to me, and I don't have a good overview of my life. 
I'm no longer leading my life,no longer having the joy to discover the world and be active when I wake up. 
I don't want to have girlfriend (only very very short experience) because I'm so bad and I cannot care about someone else and I don't want to care about someone.
However I don't feel truly sad, I don't feel like my whole family died, I'm not crying or something.
I am just out of this world, and nothing is appealing. 
This only time I am good is when I take opiates. 

Physically: 
I have constant body aches, feeling cold and not being energetic. I am experiencing a ""restless"" chest, with pain sensitivity and discomfort all over my body. I feel like the physical symptoms are the worst part but they are so connected with the mind tho. 

My symptoms are a lot worse in the morning and I have tried SSRI which didn't work obviously because I don't want to numb my feeling, I just want to feel joy and energy.
I think the problem is more related to dopamine endorphins than serotonin."
1841,I come off like a self-centered depressive robot in social situations and I'm tired of unintentionally hurting people.,"I need help. I've been in a downward spiral for the last two or three years, and my behavior is causing me to isolate myself and hurt those who have tried the hardest to help me. 

I've never maintained close relationships, but a couple of old coworkers have always continued to go out of their way to treat me like family and make an effort to stay in touch with me and invite me to events. I feel terrible because I contribute nothing to the friendship they are trying to foster; I can't see the upside to life any more. The last year has consisted of losing family members to cancer, suffering from an injury resulting in chronic pain, and being laid off from my job. My boyfriend proposed to me this year, but the stress and expectations from family for a ceremony has even sucked the joy out of that.

Here's my problem: This weekend my coworker invited me to a housewarming party at her new home. I was genuinely happy for her and her husband, and I love them dearly, but when we got to their house I felt my social anxiety kicking in and it was almost impossible for me to emote or make any sort of positive conversation. I came off like a complete asshole and I couldn't think of anything to say. The person who I consider closest to me drove hours to come to this party and made every effort to start and keep the conversation going, and again, I just shut down. I couldn't think of anything to talk about, I had nothing positive to say, and I could see their body language change and them recede from me through the remainder of the night. I don't blame this person at all- I would have been offended and hurt by my behavior and seeming lack of interest, too. I just can't believe that I shut down around the same person I could always speak to with no reservation through email, who has always been there to support me and who I consider closer than any family member. I blew it. 

I'm aware enough to realize that I've been phasing out personal relationships and isolating myself because I feel like a burden. But when I got together with the people who have worked the hardest to help me along the way the last few years, I just went right back into the cycle of sabotaging any chance of fostering the relationships I desperately need. It's almost like I live in a fog and can't find the appropriate words to say or facial expressions/body language when I'm around people. My life is becoming one long cycle of watching myself sabotage any chance of relationships with others.

Does anyone have advice on how to overcome the need to isolate yourself. I'm tired of hurting other people who only try to help me out and coming off like a self-centered, emotionless, depressive robot when I do try to interact with others. I think I've finally pushed the person I care about the most away for the last time and it hurts so bad."
1842,First time I have ever felt disassociative,"I have gotten a boyfriend. It is unreal that someone would really like me and want to spend time with me. I cant really believe it was someone I've always had a crush on. The entire time, I've been sorta just waiting for my 30-day trial of affection to be over and he'll ghost me. It has been over 30 days and a couple months actually. The other day, he asked if I got out of a bad relationship lately, bc I seem emotionally unavailable. It broke my heart in a million pieces and I wanted to cry. Then I just pushed it out of my head bc we were in a club at the time. And now that hes at work and I'm home. I just cried and cried right now bc I might fuck it all up even though I really don't want to. But bc I will trying to protect my heart - in result, I'm less affectionate and more stoic and not likable and in result that ruins the relationship. After my first bf 2 years ago, when that didn't work out. I sorta gave up. Then I meet a girlfriend who kinda was into just friends with benefits and told me how thats way better and I should do it. So after that, I just went on 100s of random dates, and sometimes I'll try get close to them or hang out more and not have sex but just get ghosted so I eventually just stuck to the mindset that, that'll be how it goes forever and I'll never have another boyfriend. I just settled with having that as a reality, thinking i still get to be less lonely while not attached with anyone so no one can ever break my trust again. So I could never be ghosted again and my feelings will always be preserved. Therefore creating the problem that is making me emotionally unavailable.  On top of that, I've finished a contract on a job I really liked and worked for 4 years. Graduated college. Lost friends. had a best friend pass recently and other things. My job, my school and my friends really made me--me. I loved school, I studied art, so I would go to school even when I was off just to use the facilities. All day I'll be there with my lunch and my headphones, creating. And then I loved my job. It was an incredibly chill office job, where I didnt have to look busy, I could freely draw and read and search the web. I knew all the duties and never had to ask questions. I could go get coffee nearby when I wanted a walk. But it was only for students. On top of my best friends passing. I just feel so disconnected from life. Now I'm just a barista. working to pay bills and wait for the next shift.  I wake up , work. sleep repeat. I realize I may never get the life I want to live as an illustrator in my own apartment just happy and able to occassionally travel, work on art projects, have a good work-life balance. I just come to the conclusion itll never be that way and that I'll just be like my parents. Going to work everyday at a boring office customer service job that doesn't fufill me in anyway, but I know what to do, I do it and get paid. I go home and live for the weekend, but im too tired so I stay inside and watch a movie. I lose my hobbies bc who has time for that. And I die. I dont want to think about that. So I just disconnect from myself and go to work. I just go to work. I just go to work. I just go to work. and work. and work. and then eventually, I die."
1843,Just wanted to say sorry,"I'm sorry I'm not doing great at my job anymore, and I'm sorry for taking it out on my coworkers when I feel shitty. I'm also sorry I just don't care about anything. I hate being like this, and I deserve it if my raise gets taken away."
1845,A summary of studying with depression,"1. Not being able to study because depressed

2. Failing because you have not studied enough 

3. Thinking you are stupid because you failed

4. Being more depressed about it

5. Repeat until you drop out"
1846,Really really depressed at the moment,"Any tips for self motivation, it’s one of the most important years of my life school wise and I can’t pull myself of this state and it keeps getting worse I’m scared I won’t be able to get out of it ."
1847,I can’t keep up the fight.,"I am close to being fired, and my sickness incapacity has been denied. It took 3 days after they was supposed to tell me, All that extra anxiety, worry and for nothing.  I got told that my condition can be treated “if I engage”. Like I haven’t been trying, as if all the constant changes to my meds, requests for therapy, reaching out to get help, fighting the drive to cut and have the blood flow. 
I can’t keep trying. I don’t even know if I can be bothered to appeal. 

I had to take the last two working days off for the worry and now I’m worried I’m gonna get crap. Il get more money if I just kill my self, and there’s less and less reason not to."
1848,Bad medical news,"Got some medical news last week that really shook me. I cried all night when I got it. I have to make changes to my health now, and I'm doing so. I just feel alone and exhausted. Food was one of the ways I dealt with loneliness and negative feelings, and now I can't do that anymore. On the weekends I go from wanting to stay in bed all day, to hoping work comes so I can get out of the house, and then when I'm at work I want to be back in bed again lol"
1849,I hurt my parents so bad.,"I don't think I can handle this much longer. My parents and siblings know my situation, so we were talking about some stuff and came to the subject of me wanting to kill myself. I then told them that I have a couple of reasons I didn't commit suicide yet. I then could only say my girlfriend was a reason. I saw my dad's heart break into one million pieces and it got to me so bad. I can't even look at him anymore. I am now almost at the point of making plans to commit suicide. I can't live with the pain of knowing what I did to my dad just now."
1850,Feel like im stuck in a rut.,"First  of all, sorry for any mistakes, english isn't my native language. I'm a  25 year old male from Germany. I currently work in costumer service for  the biggest european seller of promotional products &amp; gifts. My  company is great, my bosses are great, overall I come along with  everyone. But that's it, nothing more then coming along with each other.  My father die 1 Month ago because of lung cancer after fighting it for  alsomt 1 1/2 years. My girlfriend broke up with me shortly after. She  was pregnant. I was the happiest man on earth to be a father. After the  breakup she told me she would have an abortion and so she did. First I  lost my father, then my kid I never saw but already loved from all my  heart.

I have a history with  depression and an anxiety disorder. The panic attacks started after  smoking weed and manifested into an anxiety disorder ( Mostly thinking I  go crazy or something is wrong with my heart). I had stationary therapy  2 years ago where I met my now ex girlfriend. Since then I am mostly  reliefed of my panic attacks, but sometimes they still sneak trough. I  take medication. It really helps with the panic attacks, but not so much with the depression.

I have debts. Around 5000€. I see professional help for my debts at the end of January.

Currently  I live at home again with my Mom and my younger brother. I dont have a  room for myself and I am sleeping on the couch. I know my Mom loves me  and would do everything for me but we just cant live together. It doesnt  work. Don't ask me why, but we just have  different opinions on living  life.

That's my current situation  and mostly my story of the last years. First of all I am not suicidal,  but I would not be sad if I would die tomorrow. I feel empty. I have  nobody. Nobody I can talk to, nobody I can hang out with. All this stuff  on my shoulders and no one that helps me. I work my ass of at work  everyday because I want to get into a leading role in the company.  
I  dont get a single message for a whole week. I deletet Facebook,  Snapchat, Instagram and no one even noticed. I try to connect with so  many people but it never works. No one seems to be interestet to get in  touch with me. I'm not an easy person, but I'm not terrible either.

This  loneliness and emptiness is killing me. I am a robot. Waking up, going  to work working my ass off, coming and and go back to sleep. I don't  know when was the last time  I honestly laughed and felt happy (  Propably when my ex girlfriend told me she is pregnant ).

Thanks random reddit stranger for reading this. You are awesome!"
1851,I don't deserve to be depressed,"I feel like I don't deserve to have these dark thoughts and feelings. I had a good family growing up, I have a close group of friends that love and care about one another, but I still want to just kill myself. Like I know I've had a good life by pretty much every standard, and I just feel so ashamed that I'm like this while there are people who's lives have been so much worse than mine, yet are still powering through. I just want to remember what it's like to be happy. I feel pathetic and weak. I might be buying a gun tomorrow, just if I want to finally end it, but I also am just hoping someone will talk me out of buying it. Life just seems so pointless, like there's nothing to strive for and it's all meaningless. I wish I was super religious and just believed God has a plan for everyone and everything happens for a reason, but that shit just isn't true in my eyes. Everything, including my life, and human life in general, is so completely random. If there is a God, this quote from the intro to Is This All by Chuuwee really makes me think: ""Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a neverending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse, or some kind of punishment? I often think about the God who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to Kill It"""
1852,What has helped you make progress in your recovery?,"It’s not surprising that this sub is filled with negative thoughts. I’d like to take a moment to discuss some of our achievements. Whether it’s overcoming our insecurities, trauma, anxiety, or depression, what’s something that keeps you going? For me, it’s reading a page each day from “A Restful Mind” by Mark A. Zabawa. This book teaches me to be kind and gentle to myself when I am reflecting on my progress. So, what has helped you and what were you able to achieve with it?"
1853,"My depression is the worst it’s ever been, and I don’t know how to keep living.","I don’t want to kill myself. I have no plans to. But I don’t know how much longer I can live this life without suffering a psychotic break. 

My depression and anxiety have me shackled. My house is unclean, my clothes are wrinkled and dirty, I can’t do chores or laundry. I hardly shower. 

My job is destroying me mentally. I hate it. I can’t find anything else. I dry heave every morning before work. I’m not making enough. I’m not using my degree. I sit on Reddit at work, it’s only a matter of time before I’m fired. 

I’m in so much debt ($60k)  I’ll never get out. Student loans, auto loan, credit card debt. 

My relationship is crumbling. 

I used to be so intelligent, well-spoken, outgoing, loud, funny. I don’t know who I am anymore. I just want to sleep forever."
1854,Not eating,"Not really eating for the past week-ish, i've tried little bits here and there but all in all i find my appetite is completly vanishing, which is odd for me as i adore food.. I've stopped seeing friends, telling them i don't wish to see them.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just seem to be completly reclusing into myself and staying home on games..

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly not in the best of states mentally and i've felt very alone for a while, don't feel like i truly have anyone i can speak to or be truly open emotionally with.. i used to have a best friend i told everything.. but shes no longer my friend.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost a lot this year and beginning to feel like I'm losing myself as well.. stomachs beginning to hurt.. I'm tired all day and sleep through out the day time, becoming soley a night owl.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My therapy is now over the phone as i won't leave my home.. i tried to have fun and go out recently but honestly it wasn't so great, i gave up drinking around 1am, watched everyone laughing having fun dressed up for christmas.. and made my way home when the clubs were all still open for hours..

&amp;#x200B;

I normally stay till closing, i never leave early.. ever.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll bounce back i suppose \^\_\^ .... right?.."
1855,I just want to be good at something,"I'm like the only talentless screw-up in the grade. I'm pessimistic for the most part and suck at everything. I used to be good at a couple of things, but I've completely lost the motivation to continue them- everyone is already so much better at them anyway. I have no hobbies and nothing I love. Everything I achieve pales in comparison to everyone else in the class. I can't do anything and at this point, I don't want to either"
1856,Why are mom's so naive?,"So I'm going to write a story about my current status but I'll make sure to keep the names anonymous with either fake names or special terms like teach and mom.

So I'm in a programming highschool, a 4 year program and programming really isn't working for me. Website designing is perfect but learning programming is causing problems, but not only in school. At home my parents are yelling at me, shouting at me and calling me things that mentally hurt me. They say I can't have no problems in my head because I wasn't born with anything wrong, no one beat me and things but no one ever things that words can hurt more than physical damage. I mentally can't stay focused on anything without my brain zoning out besides music, music is my life and what keeps me sane. I can't focus on school, I can't focus on work, I always do other things because my mind gets too loud. I can't back talk because they'll always find an excuse to why they are right and I'm wrong. Old gen parents as mine are baby boomers just don't understand that anyone at any age can develop problems for reasons they don't believe in or are unaware off. Parents need to understand modern teens and millennials before they go off at them and be the reason for their drop in mentality."
1857,Unknown sadness.,"I dont really know how to start this one.  Just signed in to reddit for this very post, not that its super important but to see how this would feel.   


Came home after a 1,5 hour drive from work and spot someone else also going in to the apartment complex i live in. Its  a couple around my age with a young child in their arms. They are saying something to eachother about babys something. Im behind them as we walk through stairs, they open the door to a lovely door with christmas decoration. I get a glimpse in and see lots of red and green christmas decorations. Children sitting around a plated table, i assume it was a birthday party. Children laughing, warm lights. home.. Door shuts..  I continue up to my room/apartment but i wished i could stay in the moment... where im headed there is only  empty pizza boxes, empty single chair infront of a cluttered desktop. White bright screen with youtube, movies, games to keep me from thinking about my thoughts.   


Christmas has this wonderfool ability to make everything seem even more lonely. Ive lived in this apartment for over a year and only had one friend over. Not cuz i dont want them but i dont have friends where i live now. Ive tried to get friends but i keep loosing them. Last one was according to her: ""we have different core values""  so she didnt want me there. That one friend that have visited is my best friend and i miss him! He travels 500 km several times a year just to hangout with me. A better loyal pal is probably only found in canines haha.  


I dont even know why im sad so much. Have you had it like this : you work, long hours and its wearing you down. Then when you finally get in the car and start driving home its just tears. You are not sure why, its just soo much, whatever it is. All i know is im sad. I am broken. I am missing something in my life OR i havent been thought how to handle some part of my life. Something is not... as it should. Maybe next year will be better. Maybe the next youtube clip will cheer me up. Maybe this delicious pizza will help. Maybe..."
1858,Should I (17F) tell my parents I called the suicide prevention hotline,I've been feeling really overwhelmed and I was seriously considering ending it. Sometimes I feel so tired of being alive. I called the suicide prevention hotline and the lady was super sweet and gave me some really great advice. I'm safe for today but should I tell my parents? I don't want to be hospitalized or chastised (especially by my dad). I'm already taking depression meds and I hate seeing therapists (and talking about my feelings in general). What if I start thinking like that again?
1859,Advices of dating a girl with depression,"Don't know where else to post. 
And these advices applies to every other girl as well... Not just a girl who suffers from depression.

Even when you are not a romanticist (like me), these are some things you gotta do... Actions speak more than words... 
Treasure her more than anything, more than anyone in this world... Before you regret it losing her for the rest of your life. Accept her the way she is and love her unconditionally.

Tell her that you love her everyday, and I mean EVERYDAY! Try your best not to skip one day, even if you are angry with her... You have no idea how just 3 words, ""I LOVE YOU"", can light up her day... Those three words can make a huge difference... Sometimes with time we make the mistake of thinking ""I don't have to say it anymore, she already knows"" but I'm going to tell you that it's wrong... 

Remind her that in your eyes she's beautiful, that she's wonderful and perfect the way she is... Praise her everyday, remind her of the good qualities she has... Sometimes she might think that she's not good enough for you... Tell her otherwise... That she's giving meaning to your life with the sole purpose of existing in this world... That you are happy being by her side.

If she's feeling down, be there to support her... Listen to what she has to say... Hug her, caress her, show her some love... Remind her that she's not alone and you are there for her... That you will be always be there for her...

Small details are really important, like opening the door for her, holding the stuff for her, etc... Show that you are always thinking about her first... Even the smallest details matter... Surprise her with gifts from time to time...

Always make time for her... No matter how busy you might be... And treasure that time you share together... What else can make you happier than spending time with her?  Try finding things to do together.

Always give her the best of you... Remember that we are all humans, and we make mistakes... If you are angry, don't vent it on her... If she's angry at you, don't make it worse... Let her calm down... Don't make it worse... Sometimes we gotta take the first step, we gotta put aside our pride and apologize first (even if you think that you are right). Ignoring is not a solution... What's more important than your love for her?

Promise yourself to love her and take care of her with all your might for the rest of your life."
1860,"Mom says ""i love you"" when last year she told me to please kill myself.","I really dont know what she is trying to do. I got diagnosed with depression three years ago, and well, she hasnt been the best mom. She used to yell at me daily over random stuff, also hit me if my room wasnt 'tidy enough', and that knid of shit. But it got worse after getting diagnosed because i really didnt have the strength to deal with her, so she used that to take my phone, read my messages, make fun of my style, and so on. 

last year i reached a point where i really wanted to die, and when she found out (my therapist was telling her everything since they both where friends), she came to me with a knife and asked me to please go and kill myself, that she didn't want me there. i was having lunch, in the kitchen, with my little brother.

Once i almost called the police, because she was beating me really hard for failing a subject. When i was about to do it she rushed at me and took my phone away. So when she had my phone i managed to escape, went to my room and started packing my stuff, i didnt mind being a homeless as long as i was out of there. When she saw what i was dojng she called my dad, and he convinced me to stay.

Now, im in college, i moved out in september and she calls me everyday, she says she loves me and that shit. I feel bad for not replying with 'i love you' back. but its what i should do right? she is toxic.. 

Last friday i went to my psychiatrists appointment, and guess what? he told me that my mom loves me, but that she doesnt know how to express it. Now im lost. I feel like the bad person now, and i don't know what to do. any advice?

thank you xxxxx"
1861,I had the opportunity to walk in front of a moving car,I didn’t take it and now I feel even worse than before.
1862,I need to relieve,"Idk if I've ever had actual depression, but I'm shure I've had very bad emotional moments.
I see posts here that are very negative, fortunately, never I've never been to the point some people here did.
Today I need a relieve, lately I've been feeling empty and alone, I've been fighting with my own thoughts since I was 14, I had left it, or Controlling it very well this year, but now I'm going down again. Again to think I have no friends, my parents don't really love me or apreciate me that much, etc.
I get violent, I don't get showers, I'm kinda quiting doing music, and I do nothing all the day.
Shit, I write this bc I need to feel less lonely I guess :/"
1863,I hate my emotions,"I hate my emotions so much, I just wish I could turn them off and not feel anything. I'm a sophomore in college, and for some reason I just don't know how to handle things like an adult. So I got really close with this girl and we kinda helped one another with depression and self harm and stuff. I was like crazy into her, and I still am, but she's currently seeing one of my oldest friends. She would come over pretty much every day in the beginning of the year, just to like hang out and talk and stuff, and sometimes my friend would be in the room, sometimes he wouldn't. After the first time he met her, my friend asked me if I liked her, and I said yeah, but I don't think she wants to be anything more than friends with me. And I was fine with that, just being in her company made every single day so much better. But then her and my other friend started hooking up. Me and that guy live in the same house, so she's here literally every night but I just never get to see her anymore and I hate it so much. Like I've had crushes before, and when they haven't liked me back it was just kinda like, oh whatever I'll just move on. I don't know what's different about this girl, but she's literally perfect in every way to me and the fact that we got so close as friends just made me fall like head over heels in love with her. It's ruined my relationship with my friend though; I never talk to him anymore and just avoid him as much as possible because every time I look at him, all I can think about is how she chose him over me and I just don't understand why I'm not enough. I hate feeling like this; I should be able to just manage my emotions like an adult, but she's the one person I can't get over. She's going through my mind every day, and I can't focus on anything. Me and the girl talked last night because we'd been arguing for a couple weeks, so it was nice to like smooth everything over. When we were talking though, she said that there wasn't anything wrong with me and she doesn't know why she chose that guy over me. It didn't help at all, I still feel like I could just be better, but I have no clue what I'm doing wrong. I feel like a complete idiot for not being able to handle this like a normal human, and I just resort to using drugs and self harm. It feels like I'm just so alone all the time and I don't have anyone. I've been thinking about buying a gun, just in case I get that bad, but I want someone to talk me out of it. It feels like I don't have anyone to talk to though... She was literally the person I would talk to about everything but now I'm just alone. I don't know if anyone is even gonna read this, I just needed to say something and thought that this was the best place for it. Hope all of you are doing better than I currently am! I also hope someone talks me out of buying that, because I'm so scared if I do buy it, I'll use it. I was thinking about calling the suicide hotline last night, but then I got to anxious and didn't. I don't know guys, I'm gonna try to talk to one of my friends about it, but I don't know how I can just bring that up without them freaking out/maybe wanting to just cut me out of their life. Lately, I've just been feeling like I should distance myself from everyone, so if I end up ending it all, no one will be to broken up about it. Sorry about the rant everyone."
1864,It gets worse each day,"Most of my days are bad days, even when good things happen, I still cant bring myself to be happy. Im an ungrateful piece of shit. I'm unable to hide it anymore, people notice and they're getting sick of me which is understandable. I'm inherently flawed, I'm worthless, and soon everyone is going to know and leave"
1865,Miracle in Cell No. 7,"Just finished watching this movie for the 2nd time. My cousins wanted a fresh movie (to them) so I recommended this. 5 minutes into the movie I was silently bawling, knowing what will happen. By the time the movie finished, my tear ducts are probably dried out.

I felt like I was really doing okay lately but after watching this movie it refreshed all my compressed feelings, making the lock loose. Now I kind of feel empty, having cried my heart out but none of my personal feelings was part of the reason why I cried. And instead of relieving my problems I felt like I also took in the sadness and depression of those fictional characters. To top it all off, even if it's fiction, everyone knows it happens in real life. Maybe not to me, not to us, but to someone. 

I know that was my fault. I honestly don't know what the point of this post is. Maybe warning people not to watch or rewatch this movie. Or maybe convince people that this movie is actually helpful if you're having a hard time crying it out. 

PS. One of my cousins did not cry. She's a monster.

Tldr pls don't watch the movie you've been warned"
1866,I wish I could just die.,I don’t want to wake up another day in this world. Another day of feeling socially rejected by everyone. Don’t want to come home to empty nothingness any more. I’m just done. Just please let me die. This life is absolute torture. It’s always the worst thing.
1867,I Feel Worse,"Probably because my dad came back yesterday, just want him to go... I'm mean and ungrateful, but telling the truth, so..."
1868,Explain to me how I'm supposed to go on,"I'm 25 fucking years old now. It's like I can't kid myself anymore. I feel like I'm going to be alone forever. And even if I don't end up alone I don't think I can ever trust another person again. It feels like after all I've been through no one cares. I feel like I've been left behind. I used to be a happy kid and I don't know what happened. Friends got tired of me, wanted to move away I don't know. I've blamed myself for so long. Called myself an incel. Tried to work on myself. Told myself that I'm not entitled to sex. It's fucking sad man. The way these incels are treated. They are hurting because no one like them and then people go up and just tell them that it's because they're shitty people. Maybe that's true but how the fuck does that help? That just makes them feel worse. I hate society man. I feel like I've been fucked in a way and now it's too late. 

I wish just one person would have come up to me and asked if I was ok or tried to give me a chance. I've been hurting for so long. I don't know what it is. When I was a kid and I was in emotional pain, people would reach out and try and make me feel better. After a certain point no one gives a fuck. They just see you and are repulsed. Want to get you out of their lives as quickly as possible. I'm just so tired man. I used to be funny, make my friends laugh, I felt really close to them and they just didn't feel that way about me I guess. I just want to die man. I really do. I can't make sense of my life, what has happened to me, or any of it. I spent over 10 years blaming myself for this. Please don't tell me that I shouldn't be angry. Because I pushed that shit down for so long. I blamed my personality for over 10 fucking years. I tried to change myself. I acted like I was happy, put a fake smile on my face when I went out, did everything fucking reddit tells depressed people to do. And nothing man. It doesn't work. It just kills me in the inside more and more. And now I've had it. Don't worry I'm not going to be violent or hurt anyone. I'd rather just leave this world on my own terms. I can't deal.

Are some people just meant to be the doormats of this world? When other people feel sad or are hurting, people reach out and help. I might as well be a cockroach. No body fucking cares or has ever cared. What am I to do? I told the one girl that I clicked with that I loved her. That was like 3 years ago. We still see each other a couple times a year since she is a family friend. Needless to say our friendship or whatever we had is gone now. And she knows that I'm going through pain too. Fuck dude. I feel abandoned by the world. Like I've been left behind. And everyone on reddit loves to be like ""You need to make the effort."" or ""No one is going to reach out unless you make the first move."" Well to those people go fuck yourself. If you feel like everyone abandons you and leaves you in the dust, why the fuck would you grovel on your knees for them to accept you back? Societal outcast is what it is. When a community outcasts one of it's own, how do you heal that? Why was I left behind in the first place? That's what I want to know. Time and time again. I pray to god to fucking give me a sign or help to explain some of this shit to me but he never fucking answers. I don't even know if he is real. If he is he is an asshole because I've been stumbling through this shit life for so long. I'm never going to be happy again unless I have some kind of answer. And I can't live with the confusion and pain anymore. I'm so close man. I wish I had a gun because it'd be quicker. 

No one is going to read this. No one ever does on this subreddit. Fuck it."

'I dont care about my stuff either"".

Now i am just sad. Its a laptop that had beer spilled on it during a conference call with ex friends, been through some shit as it is.

Do you think it still works? Lol. I am drinking right now.  Fucking fun.  I wish i had smoke. Fuck.  

I only said what I said because my family allows their own children to be disrespectful towards me and my stuff but heaven forbid if my child does the same which I am diligently on them about compared to my brother who is lazy with parenting or more laid back.

1875,Verbal Judo v2 - new and improved,"**I made a thing and want to share it with you 🥳**

This post does assume that you are a bit familiar with the Feeling Good handbook. The Feeling Good handbook by David Burns has helped a lot of people, see for example this Reddit post:

* [""Feeling Good"" by David Burns changed my life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CBT/comments/7rbnch/feeling_good_by_david_burns_changed_my_life/)

**Where can I find it?**

Find it here: [https://forms.gle/6mdPaSL8kjUQG6je7](https://forms.gle/6mdPaSL8kjUQG6je7)

Or an image: [https://imgur.com/WjGJwkn](https://imgur.com/WjGJwkn)

**What is it?**

I made a simple tool (google forms) to record your automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, and rational responses in a really low-friction way.

**💒 I have gotten a lot of value out of this simple tool and would love to share my positive experiences and get feedback on the tool!**

**What is the triple column technique?**

In the book the triple column technique is explained

* In the first column you write down your automatic thoughts
* In the second column you pick one out of 10 cognitive distortions
* In the third column you practice your verbal judo and talk back to your internal critic by responding to your automatic thought with a **rational response**

**What are the 10 cognitive distortions?**

Patterns of Cognitive Distortions: These are 10 common cognitive distortions that can contribute to negative emotions. They also fuel catastrophic thinking patterns that are particularly disabling. Read these and see if you can identify ones that are familiar to you.

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: You see things in black-or-white categories. If a situation falls short of perfect, you see it as a total failure. When a young woman on a diet ate a spoonful of ice cream, she told herself, “I’ve blown my diet completely.” This thought upset her so much that she gobbled down an entire quart of ice cream!
2. **Overgeneralization**: You see a single negative event, such as a romantic rejection or a career reversal, as a never-ending pattern of defeat by using words such as “always” or “never” when you think about it. A depressed salesman became terribly upset when he noticed bird dung on the windshield of his car. He told himself, “Just my luck! Birds are always crapping on my car!”
3. **Mental Filter**: You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively, so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors a beaker of water. Example: You receive many positive comments about your presentation to a group of associates at work, but one of them says something mildly critical. You obsess about his reaction for days and ignore all the positive feedback.
4. **Discounting the Positive**: You reject positive experiences by insisting they ""don't count."" If you do a good job, you may tell yourself that it wasn’t good enough or that anyone could have done as well. Discounting the positive takes the joy out of life and makes you feel inadequate and unrewarded.
5. **Jumping to Conclusions**: You interpret things negatively when there are no facts to support your conclusion; (A) **Mind Reading**: Without checking it out, you arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you; (B) **Fortune-telling**: You predict that things will turn out badly. Before a test you may tell yourself, “I’m really going to blow it. What if I flunk?” If you’re depressed you may tell yourself, “I’ll never get better.”
6. **Magnification**: You exaggerate the importance of your problems and shortcomings, or you minimize the importance of your desirable qualities. This is also called the “binocular trick.”
7. **Emotional Reasoning**: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: “I feel terrified about going on airplanes. It must be very dangerous to fly.” Or “I feel guilty. I must be a rotten person.” Or “I feel angry. This proves I’m being treated unfairly.” Or “I feel so inferior. This means I’m a second-rate person.” Or “I feel hopeless. I must really be hopeless.”
8. **“Should statements”**: You tell yourself that things should be the way you hoped or expected them to be. After playing a difficult piece on the piano, a gifted pianist told herself, “I shouldn’t have made so many mistakes.” This made her feel so disgusted that she quit practicing for several days. “Musts,” “oughts” and “have tos” are similar offenders.
9. **Labeling**: Labeling is an extreme form of all-or-nothing thinking. Instead of saying “I made a mistake,” you attach a negative label to yourself: “I’m a loser.” You might also label yourself “a fool” or “a failure” or “a jerk.” Labeling is quite irrational because you are not the same as what you do. Human beings exist, but “fools,” “losers,” and “jerks” do not. These labels are just useless abstractions that lead to anger, anxiety, frustration, and low self-esteem.
10. **Personalization and blame**: Personalization occurs when you hold yourself personally responsible for an event that isn’t entirely under your control. When a woman received a note that her child was having difficulties at school, she told herself, “This shows what a bad mother I am,” instead of trying to pinpoint the cause of the problem so that she could be helpful to her child. When another woman’s husband beat her, she told herself, “If only I were better in bed, he wouldn’t beat me.” Personalization leads to guilt, shame, and feelings of inadequacy."
1876,Maybe the world really is that messed up?," 

Sometimes i wonder if maybe those suffering with depression are the ones who are seeing things for what they really are, and are just more sensitive to the inhumanity we encounter every single day when we turn on the news, or come face to face with how horrible human beings can be on a regular basis.

Take a good look at the state of our country (US), look at what is going on in the world, think about the fact that it is becoming normalized that our children get shot going to school. I have no ability to turn that off. Maybe depression is normal. Maybe everyone else has their head in the sand. Maybe the planet really is headed for complete disaster, and our kids will pay the price for our stupidity.

I would give anything to be one of these people who can just pretend this stuff is not going on, or stick their head in the sand, but I’m not. I have spent my life thinking I am crazy for letting this stuff get to me so much. Maybe I am normal for being depressed and the rest of the world has lost its mind.

I do not want to feel this way, but i absolutely do. I am curious to see if anyone else has thought this way.

Thanks."
1877,"I wrote a poem about my depression, does anyone else feel the same? It’s called ‘Would you help?’ It’s currently the only way I can put it into words","What would you do if I was no longer there?
Would you even notice or care?

Would your walls come crashing down? 
Would you feel the need to stick around? 

Would you speak fondly of me?
Or would it be a question of who was she?

Would your tears flow like a stream? 
Would you just hope it was all a dream? 

Would you even question yourself?
Or would it all be put down to mental health?

Would you have tried to help?
Because I felt left on the shelf 

Would you have seen the signs?
Because I was showing I was not fine 

Would you have helped me cheat death?
Because no one was there when I took my last breath"
1878,Cut my hair,"I cut a bit of my hair and it was oddly satisfying. And watching myself smoke brings me peace for some reason. Depression. Yay. Right? Glad I took a shower today of all days. Weirdly enough. I look ok. Despite i feel dead inside right now. I casuuallly tossed my laptop to the floor today like it was paper saying:

""I don't care about my stuff either. "" 

That is how much i give fucks today."
1879,Is it the end of me?,"It has been 7 years since one of my classmates committed suicide because of being bullied both irl and on internet.

All of that happened, because of you know...me.

After hearing that the girl (names are excluded for the sake of privacy) had taken her own life, I was in shock. In fact, everyone was in major shock that someone they really loved is gone, just because of my stupid body-shaming jokes.

Days passed, all of my friends started to push me away from them, as if I am some kind of demon. The other day, I came back home seeing my clothes being thrown off the balcony by my parents. I had to relentlessky beg them to let me stay in the house, in condition I have to hand them all of my electronic devices for 3 months. 

Several months passed and since then, I lost all of my friends. My family is slowly pushing me away from them too. My mom told me once ""Be sure to love everyone, whatever their age, disabilities, race, etc.""

I wish I had listened to her.

Now I have got my devices back, since I'm already 23 and I'm living alone. But sadly, all of my connections to my family and friends, have been cut off completely. I still lived in the same town, so I spent some of my days to visit and groom the girl's grave. Sometimes, I looked at the picture of her family next to the grave, and I just cried continuously.

I took a loved one from their family, and yet I'm still alive, assumed to be ""enjoying"" my life while I'm not.

I know I am a douchebag, I am a demon which lives on other people's suffering.

I wanted to change myself. But I couldn't.

Everything is pretty much over for me. I took a dumb bullying act too far that it caused suicide.
I am a murderer, I know. You can tell me to kill myself, that's okay.

I never wanted to live anymore.

Goodbye."
1880,Today I went to the doctor and decided to ask about psychological help,"She asked me why I think I'd need therapy. I should've said that I'm completely hopeless and have suicidal thoughts and just feel like a failure or just *something* that expresses how shitty I feel.

1883,Is that really depression?,"I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety but recently I've been started to doubted it. What if I am actually just a lazy piece if shit who happens to be highly unlikeable? What if I don't have mental illness, I just happen to be a horrible person?

1884,How to stop emotional eating?,"I just can't stop eating. I just eat all the time. Sad? Eat. Happy? Eat. Depressed? Eat. Bored? Eat. Anxious? Eat. I often eat sweets to the point that I feel ill, and can't go one day without sugar. I am not overweight, yet, but I can see this starting to affect my physical health; mainly teeth and skin at this point. I feel like while my depression has been getting better, the emotional eating and over eating has been getting worse. That feels quite backwards? Has anyone else experienced this?

This world is already dead to me. It always has been. I only wish to die. Every day and every moment it’s at the forefront of my disturbed and twisted mind. I have no one and nothing to live for. No hope. No dreams. No cure. There is nothing to be gained here..."
1888,Can I die today,"Nevermind I was raped twice and had two miscarriages because I refuse to have the children by some stranger.

Life just isn't going well and I don't know when it will ever get better. I have family that doesn't believe the trauma had happened because there is no physical proof other than me going to the emergency room, rape kit test and police reports but that is non existent in my families eyes. 

I guess I need to be in a wheelchair like my brother to have people pay attention to me. Although he did it to himself from drinking that night and driving angrily because his baby momma was being a hoe and his ex girlfriend was living in his home. 

But thats okay. I am the problem child. The problematic adult. Who still hasn't gotten my life together either so who am I to judge despite everyone around me judging me..? 


Can i just die today. Please."

I know I should be getting out of the house more since I rarely do that but I just don’t wanna deal with socializing today. I know I’m gonna have a good time but I’m gonna be exhausted, I just know it.

The weather keeps me inside, I've been betrayed by my closest friends and my now ex-boyfriend so I have only one person to spend time with (my best friend). I'm really struggling. My life feels utterly hopeless and meaningless. I feel like I'm in a daze. This is the worst I've been since I was a teenager. I have started going to yoga again, it helps a little, it breaks up the day at least. But man, 3 weeks in bed, watching the same show over and over on Netflix. I just want someone to come and make my brain okay so I can function like a ""normal"" adult in the world."
1892,Fun story about crying in a train station,"Sorry if this is all over the place just gotta get this shit out. Got locked out of my house and my landlord is a cunt so I couldn’t call a locksmith. Was planning to go sleep at a friends house so went to the underground to get to hers and then decided I didn’t want her to see me in the state I was in (a complete mess, suicidal and on the verge of dissociation) so I just stayed on the floor crying on the platform shouting insults at my boyfriend down the phone because I don’t understand why he still wants to or should be with me when I’m this depressed. I must’ve looked like such a mess that two of the underground staff came to speak to me and take me upstairs. Ended up walking to a hotel and spending £80 for one night until my housemate finished her night shift and was able to unlock the door. I’d only eaten breakfast that whole day and had worked my way through a bottle and a half of wine. Honestly don’t know how much longer I can live like this lol I’ve never felt as bad as I currently do and it hasn’t gotten better for two weeks. 

Oh and I was also approached by some guy who’s sole purpose of approaching me was to tell me I looked upset and that I *cant* be upset because it’s Christmas. 

Thanks for listening"
1893,Anyone else saw that rumor video going around?,"Anyone else saw the video titled ""1444"", which shows a russian guy shooting his brains out.

1895,Parents business going under and mother had a stroke,"Back in May my mother had a stroke. It was a bad one. For over a month we didnt know if she was going to come back to us or not. She wasnt in a coma but in ""lala land"". Slowly she came back to us. But around the same time we started getting letters from the IRS. Mom was also the accountant. Myself and father found out mom wasnt paying the IRS certain bills. Now we owe them around 80k and I've been  struggling to manage the books and help my mother recover. My father is helping too but we can only do so much. A few weeks ago we decided to sell the business, it's all too much for us. We are all stressed and worn out. I havent seen a therapist yet and I know I need to but I just feel so empty right now. I have no energy, passion or anything left."
1896,Do seemingly harmless comments ever hit to hard for some of you?,"Sometimes people around me, like my coworkers or family, will make depression comments, or say things that would normally be considered harmless, but they cut me really deep on the inside. For example, my boy friend is extremely supportive and will do just about anything to help make life easier. However, the other day I was complaining about how cleaning my apartment seemed like a massive uphill climb, and I was almost in tears just thinking about getting up and doing it. My boy friend then said “no one is feeling bad for you, get up and do it”. I know he wasn’t even thinking about my depression at that point, and it just came out, but it hurt. I just thought “you’re right, no one does feel bad for me. I’m just a massive piece of shit who feels bad for myself for something as simple as cleaning. I’m a huge waste of a life”. I think he realized what he said was hurtful later because he came up and was telling me what a good job I was doing, and how I just need to take it one step at a time, so I know he didn’t mean to be rude, but it still really really hurt."
1897,When did you figure out you were depressive ?,"Hi guys,

I am used to browse this sub, but under an other account posting in other subreddits, so I just created an other not to involve friends in this.

(sorry for the English mistakes)

Recently (1 month ago) I was diagnosed depressive. I knew it. Since September I was just going back home, crying, eating, sleeping. I had my car towed, a close relative died, I was in a new university. Like everything was going bad. Every attempt by me to make new friends was a failure. I try to join a sports club, but I did not have the energy to actually do sports, and at the end of the training, I cried because I knew my mind won over my body.

I saw everything I could lose : my relatives, my friends, my GF who is an incredible person. I could also fail my studies, be a sort of shame. It was so spiraling. I was getting out of control, dark thoughts every second, nothing I could do to stop these. I browse this sub and realized I was depressive. As many people recommended it,  I decided to go to a therapist.

It helped me a lot. The first few appointments were OK, I had the feeling of getting better a little. Then one of those awful weeks hit. I went to therapy and oh god, I never cried like I did. Like all the water out of my body during half an hour. I felt so miserable. Since one month, I feel like I am getting better. Did not have dark thoughts until today, they are back ...

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the therapy leads me to trying to figure out when I began to be unhappy and why. Even if September was the roughest of all months of my life, I had already been tired before and never reacted this way. So this is because of emotions, not because of tireness.

And as I thought I had hit the most painful road of toughts, well I feel like I am heading to an other. I have been depressed for over 4 years. Since 4 years every week or so I cried but did not know why sometimes. At randoms moments during the day, during parties, I used to head outside, and cry. Sometimes a friend would come by and ask what was making me cry, and I could not answer ... I had everything : good friends, family, GF during a time, I was having good grades, but still. I felt useless. I felt alone. I feared to be alone so every evening I was spending it with some friend. If I had nothing scheduled, I would ask friends 'What do you do tonight ?'. If I happened to be alone, I was going to sleep very early as I had no hobby, I was unable to read, etc. For more than 4 years I have never been alone by myself longer than now, as I am in a new city. This is funny when I think about it haha :) Can you imagine the amount of money I spent in food and drinks with friends during all those years of not willing to be alone ?

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have a GF, and I really care about her. I do not want my depression to have an bad impact on our relation. She knows. But it is so so tough to prevent depression from reaching our relation. I care so much about her, and I want sometimes to close myself in so that I can heal, but I want her with me, I dont want to hide my fears, because I have been doing it for too long.

&amp;#x200B;

 Why have I been imposing me this ? I never had some hobbies by myself. I am so anxious when I am alone. I fear of losing what I have, of being forgotten. This is so so painful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some days, I get frustrated of not being able to be like other people. I feel frustrated of others not being able to understand what I go through, and of only having 45 minutes of therapy per week at most to try to heal myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in a toxic relationship with myself. And today I realize this toxicity is destroying me and I need to react. But I am still suffering, how to get better ? I know I should try to get better by myself, not considering what I could lose, but how ? How not to be anxious when fearing to lose friends and GF when you try to heal ? I already see some friends taking distance as I feel bad and begin to talk about my depression. And in my family, we are not the best speakers for the 'how-do-you-feel-today' part.  From this toxicity against myself, I developped obsessive behaviours, if not maniac stuff : I must always take the left side of an obstacle, I check everything several times. It also created insecurity in my relations with friends and with my GF.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a part of my life (I am 22) where I need a lot of energy as I am beginning an important step in my studies, in my relationship also, but I feel like I am going to lose everything. 

Finally, I am wondering if I might be on the Autistic spectrum. I realized there are some behaviours that might hint this : I cant maintain eye contact except for a very few people (my GF, my parents and some of my siblings, that is pretty much it) and always felt unable to maintain it long with friends. I am kind of skilled in what I study. I dislike when there is too much light, too much people, too much noise. I cant focus on what I do, except for my study stuff, for a long time and always think of something else. But I use to be a social person as well. I use to walk around when I think about something, like if I was walking in my little world.

 I told my therapist and he did not seem very conviced about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think ?"

I don't like doing anything, i don't like to go to job. I don't like waking up in the morning, i don't like to bath. I don't like washing my clothes. I don't like studying, all i do is listen sad songs (Prateek Kuhad, The Local Train, Last Cigarette etc).

I had a girlfriend, was in a long distance relationship with her for 3 years, she broke up with me without any reason, was in depression for 6 months when i was in third year.

We were in the same city so i started meeting her and we were in the relationship again. I don't like anything other than spending time with her. I feel bad because I'm the only when who spends when we go out. But i still buy her whatever she wants just to enjoy the moment.

When i leave her i feel like i wont meet her again because it costs a lot of money but then again i start to miss her.

I start crying for no reason. I feel low most of the time. Please suggest me what should i do, should i go to a doctor? And what is this mental illness called. I feel i dont want to live, life's hard."
1905,"I like myself, but I hate society.","I feel like my depression is weird because I like who I am, for the most part. I don't have a problem looking in the mirror. I'm ok with the way I look. I feel like my problem is society. I'm just constantly disappointed by people and by the way the world works. By the people who have deceived me into thinking they would help me when they don't actually give a shit. I keep thinking I'll meet better people, but then I meet more people who let me down and don't give a shit.

I'm getting to the point where I expect people to be shit. I expect people to try to deceive me and be greedy and unhelpful, especially boomers. And I give people so many chances to do better, but people are mostly shit."
1906,I deserve to be treated like garbage,"I deserve to be treated like dirt.  I don't do anything.  My traumas that happen to me are not important.  My self respect and stuff don't deserve to be treated with respect,  care or love.  I am taking anti depressants and anxiety medications.  I am going to therapy but it isn't enough.  This year has been the worst and the most tough,  rough of them all but I can't seem to remember any happy moments. 

I am nothing but a vermon. Someone who is a burden.  My mother always wanted me gone.  My brothers hate me.  Nothing I do is good enough.  All I ever do is nothing. Just a waste of space.  My family hates me. Never talks to me and when they do, it is only to bitch me out, make fun of circumstances,  say they are glad it isnt them and when shit hits the fan, police are called then my mother goes into this state of 

""Why why why stop stop stop""

Like... its whatever at this point dude.. no one to blame but ourselves...mostly my fault.. i shouldn't have threw anything...because i deserve to have someone tell me that I am worthless,  that I am a waste of space, that I think I am some princess when I am not.. because I am not.. I am just scum..I mean shit... I am 27... how fucking pathetic can I be to still not have my life together...? I am paying for a car and thats where most of the money goes to, I paid back my mom and I do my best to pay on the lights..but shit..it isnt enough.. i guess it isn't enough..i am not enough..i miss having my own place to stay... miss being able to have it together.. but I am nothing but a fuck up.i dont deserve pity. I deserve to be treated like shit.

If it wasn't for the safe in the bedroom I don't know the combination to, I would have shot myself in the face today.  Instead I threw the safe because I couldn't access it.

I deserve to have people talk ugly to me.  I deserve to have people walk over me.  I deserve to not have a voice.  Me right now,  crying? I deserve it. I halfway thought about running off into a ditch while driving.  

I am a horrible mother.  I don't deserve anything but death.  I hope someone ""accidentally "" shoots me one day.  

Doesn't seem like I am going anywhere in life. I wish my ex killed me when he had the chance.  

I am nothing but garbage.  Trash. Waste. Of a human being who brings more problems than solutions..  this is my hell.. And i deserve it all.."
1907,"I have unrequited romantic feelings for a guy friend, it's killing me and I want to get over it","So, a bit of context. I'm a 22 yo female, the guy is a 21 yo male. We've been friends for more than 5 years. I had no romantic interest in him till last spring. In fact, he proposed we become friends with benefits at some point, which I turned down because I just wasn't interested at the time. He confessed to having wanted to kiss me during one of our hang outs, but not pursuing it because he thought I didn't want it.

This March, too, I started developing something for him-getting excited when he texted me, being bubbly and happy after hanging out with him, becoming jealous when he mentioned a girl was pretty, etc. We heavily made out one night, at my proposal and I confessed my feelings for him a few days after-which he turned down. We kept talking, though, and we ended up having sex at his proposal-which he felt kind of bad about after, since he felt he had used me.

I got into another relationship around that time-a really nice one, but it lasted only 3 months(that's for another post). I really thought I'd gotten over him by that point, but I still had self esteem issues from the rejection(which I'll elaborate on in a moment). Though, last month he got a girlfriend and it really killed me emotionally.

So, concretely, my problems are: 1) Us being friends, over the years he told me about all of his crushes/girls he's attracted to. I swear to God it's EVERYONE except me-and he doesn't even seem to have a type or like a particular kind of personality. This makes me feel like I'm somehow inferior or defective-that everyone else is pretty and I'm not, like every other girl is normal and I'm not, like I was born missing something. I RATIONALLY know this isn't the case-I've dated and been pursued by ""higher up"" guys than he is-better looking, more confident, etc. who had no interest in those girls, but emotionally it still feels like shit.

2) He got a girlfriend and gosh i have the hugest inferiority complex towards her-she's extremely pretty, extremely cultured-, has the best taste in books and music, is artsy a high school valedictorian, tweets the wittiest jokes AND seems like an incredibly kind and fun person. Rationally, I know that I'm all these things and also have qualities of my own, but I cant't persuade my emotional side. I can only think of how lucky she is.

3) Aside from my insecurities(which I seriously don't know how to get rid of), I just can't get this situation out of my head. I literally wake up and the first thought is ""he has a girlfriend"". I sometimes can't relax or do anything nice because it just pops in my head. I've tried to get my mind off things, to do some volunteer work or hang out with friends, but then I'm like ""SHE doesn't need to do that to feel good, she's happy and loved"". I wish my parents had made me like her instead of like me. I know, everyone has their issues, no one is perfectly happy-but God, would I trade places with her in a second, including her issues.

Look, I know I may sound like a spoiled white girl, but it's something that's really bothering me. I want to do something about it, I've even started going to therapy but it hasn't helped so far. If you have ANY sort of advice, please share."
1908,I stole money from my mother as a kid.,"tl;dr: when I was a kid, I stole money from my mother and I am feeling excessive guilt about it.

My mother is one of those people who do not use banks for religious reasons. She used to store her money, all of it, inside a safe in her room. 

When I was a kid and my mother allowed me to be inside her room she would sometimes open the safe and I would see the hundreds of bills that she has stored inside the safe. I got this stupid idea that if I stole one bill she would never notice. So, I stole a bill. She had not noticed. I stole again. She had not noticed. I stole again and again until she had noticed and told me while she was crying that she thinks that I was stealing the money. I felt ashamed of myself and instinctively tried to resist admitting that I was stealing money from her but eventually I admitted. I was around 11 or 12 when this happened. I am currently 21 and still feeling guilty about it.

I do not remember how much I had stolen. It is probably around 600 US dollars in total converting our local currency.

I was a victim of abduction and sexual assault by four men when I was fifteen. I am clinically diagnosed with PTSD, Social Anxiety, and Depression. My therapist told me that feeling excessive guilt is a sign of my mental condition. Is that true? I had stolen 600 dollars from my own mother. I must be feeling guilty about it. Sometimes, I feel that I deserved what had happened to me when I was fifteen. Please, I need someone to tell me that what I had done is forgivable. I am feeling too much guilt."
1909,Why everyone looks so rude,"i have some difficulting in expressing myself, even for my therapist. Because everyone seems so rude and insensitive its really hard for me to deal with people. Im suppouse to be rude and aggressive too, so i can be accepted?Maybe im too sensitive and care to much about others people opinion, but im not allowed to be this way?Call me weak if u want but im not change myself so i can have a couple of friends obs: sorry my english"
1910,Someone there to talk about life?,"So, i’ve been diagnosed with depression and have schizophrenia like symptoms, cant stop thinking, basically my head feels like its gonna explode any second, i’m on 30mg of lexapro for 6 weeks now but idk doesn’t do much and i cant be alone, otherwise the thinking spiral starts. If someone out there wants so call or chat, let me know :)"
1911,Depression having a go at me.,"I've been clinically depressed for at least four years now, after the birth of my son. It's been ""managed"" with medication. Lately that management has been down the drain... Changed medication quite a few times over the years and thought we found one that sticks but over the course of the last two weeks my mood has taken a swan dive. 

They've changed the medication again but my brain chemicals aren't responding. I have no motivation. I lack energy, there's no ""joy"" in anything. My life has become a stagnant pool of ... Nothing.. I guess. I slept all day yesterday because I couldn't find the will to do anything else. Sleep offers an escape that consciousness can't provide. 

My son is with my sister until I can get over this. I'm not sure how I'll do it. I feel hopeless for the future, even though the logical part of my brain fights against how I feel and tells me to just hang on, it'll get better. 

Hard to see that hope when I feel lost. 

Anyway. Enough of this rant. I hope everyone here is doing something for themselves today. I'm at work, which is about the best I can get. I have another appointment on Thursday. I dread the weekend."
1912,i wish depression was a person.,"so i could beat the damn shit and torture him to death, like he's doing to me. Fuck you. Fuck you, depression. Fuck. You. So. Fucking. Much.

Othe than that, i also wish i was dead. Not non existant, just dead. Im non existant for other people anyways."
1913,fuck social media for making me like this,social media makes you feel like everyone should know what you’re thinking feelings or doing and when you don’t get the feedback you expect or the validation back you feel sad and worthless that’s honestly bullshit some shit it’s just for u to keep for urself and it’s so hard for me to not want to post everything bc i want attention all the fucking time  it’s sick and twisted and i fucking hate myself for it but i can’t stop it bc even tho i don’t say it im like everyone else i want attention and validation and not even from the right people just literally anyone
1914,I’m normally good at controlling this. I’m normally in control of all of it. But today I am falling apart.,Maybe it’s the time of year maybe it’s what tomorrow represents. I really don’t know. I am good about locking everything up inside and it not affecting me but today it’s boiling over. I know if I let it out I’m done for. Once i let it out it’s going to keep coming out and there will be no stopping it and I don’t have time to recover. With this much inside locked away I am looking at months of recovery. Months of being useless and unproductive. If that happens I lose everything. I am already losing it slowly but there’s still a chance of not losing it all. Watching the last part of endgame just about made me lose control. I know stupid and pathetic but I always thought I was meant for something. I know I am doing something but my gut has always felt like I was supposed to do something big and maybe I still will maybe it’s not time for it yet but right now I feel like I missed it or I didn’t do something I was supposed to do so I could do it. Maybe I’m just fooling myself into thinking I matter at all maybe it’s just something I have lied to myself about to keep myself from realizing that I’m a failure in life. That I failed my daughter to the point her mother was able to easily get her to hate me. Or my son is failing and I feel like I’m at fault for it. I’m behind on every bill and the only way to get them caught up is to ask one person for a loan and that person will hold it over my head forever just showing me more and more that I’m a failure. I really don’t think I can continue on this path I am on much longer and keep it together and I don’t see a way to another path. I feel like my dreams are just that dreams I can never achieve
1915,How do I get over a heartbreak - the first one I’ve opened up to in years - when everything is so perfect?,"So I’ve been emotionally closed off since few years ago. Dead weight ever since. Depressed, abusive family, and having to deal with my mum’s death.

It’s only few months back that I met this person so special that I was willing to open up for the first time. He made me feel alive. Everything was perfect, and I was also surprised that I could feel this way again.

We were dating for a few months but we were very close and I saw him almost every other day.

Earlier this month though we had the talk and he decided that he couldn’t take this to the next level due to certain incompatibility issues and he feared this rs would be unsustainable in the future (simply put, I do know this means he probably doesn’t like me enough).

I understood and accepted it and we ended things - it was a teary night and it was rly difficult to let go for both of us - think he might be battling with his thoughts vs feelings as well - but I did anyway.


Now.. how do you get over a heartbreak like this? When everything is perfect? Nothing is wrong as of now. And I know I might sound delusional but as of now he is literally perfect for me. In the few months spent I haven’t found anything I didn’t like. I loved every moment.

I’m also afraid I won’t stop comparing everyone to him. How do I move on from something and someone so perfect? At least that’s what it is to me rn."
1916,Im Tried Of Being The Nice Guy,"All my life I strived to do better and be better. Better then the toxic people in my life, better then shitty people online better then what box people tried to push me into. I wanted to be a good person to be a good person. I wanted to give up people, and make everyone smile and be happy. But time and time again I am hurt and back stabbed and betrayed. And everytime I try to stand up for myself im the one whose suddenly a jerk or an asshole because for once I wanted to do something for me so that I can be happy. 

Now I get why people become assholes after years of being nice. I get why girls become ""bitches"" in the end and I get why once nice people turn mean. 

Im sick of being walked all over and losing everything I loved and care for because I wanted to be kind to others. For once I want to do something for me. 

I've lost everything. Now I have nothing else to give and nothing to lose."
1917,Increasingly Questioning My Value,"This is my first post here, and tbh I don't know why I'm doing it but I just need to vent really quickly.

This past year has been complete garbage. I've had many depressive episodes throughout my life but this year took the cake. Yesterday, this person I had been talking to for awhile just blocked me on everything. Went full on Danny Phantom and for the life of me I can't figure out why. Everything was great, and as always, I got my hopes up and now I feel like withering away. This has happened so many times before but for some reason, rn, I really don't care anymore. I just want it all to end. More than I ever have.

Long story short, I don't see the point in carrying on, and I've set a date. If you even read this, thanks for noticing."
1918,empathetic much,trying to sympathize with everyone right now but i only find everyone straight up annoying
1919,Ongoing Struggle With Taking Medication,"Spent a long time deciding whether or not this was where this post belonged--then I thought to myself, well where *else*? 

Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a year ago. Feel like I've been saying a ""year ago"" for the past six, but realistically I think it's actually been a year and 1/2. Not sure what information is necessary, but just wanted to provide some background. I was originally put on Zoloft. Hated it. Got on Wellbutrin, and it made me extremely anxious, but more productive. Short after, my doctor suggested I paired it with Prozac.

 More recently, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed 20 mg of adderall. All three diagnoses were a long time coming, but if I'm honest the ADHD almost brought me relief. Part of me feels like it all finally makes sense now--the depression and anxiety. Feeling helpless for so *long.* Maybe that's why I felt relieved? 

I'm a sophomore in college (went away for college last year--transferred back home due to mental health) with maybe 25 credits to my name because I'm so damn terrible at finishing things I have started. 

**One of those things being** ***my medication.***

Everyone in my life has always been extremely supportive of everything I've done and all I have been through. When I came back to attend this ""new"" University I was looking forward to a more comfortable start close to home. I'd been taking my medications consistently over the summer. I'd forget once in awhile, of course, but I tried hard to be on top of everything.

When September came, all my initial excitement and anticipation had faded. I started to forget to take my medication a few times a week before my boyfriend spoke up and encouraged me to set a reminder on my phone. He set one too. *Easy fix.*

Nope. Even with the reminder, I started to notice I would think about my medication and it's location, but I wouldn't take it. Sometimes I'd think about my meds two, three, even four times throughout the day. Often, all three pills would be within arms reach (usually in my backpack since I spend the night in various locations), and I would still choose to leave them in the pocket. 

So, of course, I start doing pretty shitty. Sleeping a lot. Falling far, far behind academically. Holding it together better than I probably should have mentally, but that was when I wasn't trying to get in a nap or two. October flies by, and I have my medication with me all the time, but I just let it sit there.

At one point (Mid November?), I even go to pick up a refill for prescriptions that I haven't even finished the previous bottle of (mostly so my mom would stop nagging me). 

This behavior went on until about a week and 1/2 ago. My mom knew I had stopped taking them and begged me to make some changes. Regardless, I have successfully, unintentionally? *intentionally without thinking too far into it?* tanked all my grades this semester. I'm looking at straight F's if my professors don't excuse my absences with the note from my therapist. Classes end this week. That's not my main concern, though.

So, I've been taking my medication consistently for almost two weeks now. I even arranged the next month's worth into one of those containers that organizes pills by the day. Now, as I write this, I'm sitting in bed just looking at it. I can't decide if I want to put the three of them down today or not. I know they're there and I've been thinking about them all morning.

***""So why don't you just take them?""*** My mom, boyfriend, and a series of other people ask. I don't really know. That's why I am posting this. **Does anyone else struggle with this at all?** If so, have you identified why? I don't want to believe that maybe I am just too lazy to grab the pills and swallow them, but I don't think that is it because I have exhausted a lot of energy just thinking about their existence and about how I *should* just take them.

I feel like I should probably mention that I haven't had any bad side effects from any medications I've ever taken besides sleeping a lot on Zoloft. All they have ever really done is helped me so I don't understand why this is such a power struggle for me almost daily. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
1920,Can't make conversation anymore?,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't feel depressed, but I definitely feel off. 

Anyway. I can't make conversation anymore? I just have absolutely no idea what to say. I ignore my friends and am not interested in seeing them. 

I avoid going into the kitchen for breakfast because my family is there.

I can barely start a conversation with my boyfriend, and he doesn't really start anything, so our texts consist of small talk and one word answers. I don't know how to fix myself. 

I'm on antidepressants. Again I dont feel depressed, I just feel off? Apathetic?"
1921,my life is boring,"i’m seventeen tho treated like a child 

i don’t care about anything nor have interests towards anything 

i’m just existing, and i’ve acknowledge how many other people out here feel the same 

i’m failing all of my classes, i used to do well in school but i find it hard to care now 

my mother doesn’t believe me or my feelings

she thinks i’m being bored and dramatic 

and that my life is soooo good and i have no reason to be depressed 

it’s fucked up m8 idk 

i’m not even sad about things anymore 

i’m just empty"
1922,My story about depersion and my life,"Hi I am a 14 male boy, living in England and this is my story about hard times.

In fifth grade all the kids in my school had this toy, I don't really remember what but, everybody had it. When I confronted my mother about this she said she was working and could not afford the toy, this was because I had loads of Lego and all of that stuff. I remember this as a horrible excuse to say that my mother was poor, but my 10yr old brain did not understand stand that. So I told my teacher about this and she freaked out. And that was only the beginning.

A short time after (maybe 5 or 3 days) I told this the teacher invited me to a meeting with the child welfare. They had pressured me to tell them that my father was hitting me and doing all kinds of bad stuff to me. As a 10yr old I did not understand any of this. I just wanted the toy. And I know that I may have been selfish but, hear me out I was a 10yr old. 

The talks continued and slowly I was realizing what what happening. How they pressured me and how my father was talking to me how I should not talk to them about stuff. 

This was the first stage I'd my depression. I felt guilty of what I was saying and wanted to dissaper. I slowly started to get rid of these thoughts. 

And now for the second stage. 11yr old was in bed and suddenly heard a cry. I went out if bed to go to the living room. It was my mother and father arguing. This was shocking to me and I was scared. My parents just told me to go to bed. After that day my parents told me that they were getting divorced. This hurt me badly and I started to get these toughts that it was my fault that they had divorced. 

Currently
It is 8 grade and I meet this dude in school, anom. I started to get along with him good and we started talking alot to each other. He told me that he was a semi-gangster that was dealing with drugs. I say ok to try weed and it was cool. 

Before I tell more I am a very emotional dude who can cry like 123.

I started crying whenever I smoked and that's when I realized I had depersion. Life started to get boring and stuff like gaming, hobbies etc. Started to get Boring. I decided to stop weed and find another hobby Wich was anime, it was cool and cool. 

So yeah, that's my story. I am still feeling depressed and I am wondering if I should've even writed this. But whatever, i dont really give a f**k about this life anymore."
1923,Having a bad time getting over a breakup. Desperately need advice.,"We were together for about 3 years. And now we have been apart for more than that.
I think about her often, a few times a day every day. If there's a lot going on  and I'm generally stressed about life and not thinking about her during the day, often times I will still dream about her.

I know thats kinda normal immediately after a breakup, I don't know what ""normal"" is, a few weeks? Maybe a couple months of being sad about it if it was a long term relationship?

It's been over 3 years since I've talked to her. I completely removed any reminders of her from my life. No social media, no mutual friends I talk to anymore, I have moved to a new town since then, I've dropped out of school, I have even deleted all the music that I listened to during that time of my life. There is literally nothing. Nothing that should even faintly remind me of them. Yet I cannot get them out of my head.

What's wrong with my brain.

I'm going to delete this soon because I was too lazy to make a throwaway"
1924,A friend of mine just gave me an early Christmas present,"It was a self-made card and a pack of small candy canes. I got home just now and burst into tears of joy, for someone gave enough of a shit about me to give me a present."
1925,Why do they force us to live,"Why do I need to live. Everyday I wish I'd died during my suicide attempt one year ago. I just don't get it. Nobody has ever really cared about me, every single friend I've ever had has abandoned me and even my family didn't give a shit about me before but when you try to kill yourself suddenly everyone cares and is so upset. 

Like they say suicide is selfish but in the end I feel like they're the ones that are selfish. Because they don't want to feel responsible or bad.

And then it's all like 'it gets better' even though my 18 years of miserable existence have disproved this about a million times. I have social anxiety and my whole life I've been told I'm weird and I need to change, by my family, by teachers, by other students. But I just can't. I will never be able to get a job or fit in how they want me to because I simply have a disease that keeps me from doing so. If it was a physical illness they'd understand.

School is ending for me in a few months and honestly I thought I'd be excited but I'm just scared. Like I really just can't do this. I wish they would just let me die"
1926,Seeking Help that won't hurt me?,"I've struggled with stuff for a long time, I do have a past suicide attempt years back etc... and I've fallen pretty deeply into that mood and mindset again.  


I've sought help in the form of a therapist, my family doctor is helping with a prescription and does follow ups and I've got a pretty good friends and family structure.   


The issue I've started to have is that since suicide is a large part of the thinking to me, that is something I need to talk about and I want to be talking about with a therapist or something. 

But I've now had 2 separate instances where I was seeing the therapist at a group practice thing she works out of, and they basically didn't want to let me leave and were going to make me go to an emergency place, and I had to convince everyone it was fine. 

And just this past weekend, I called a suicide hotline and without telling me she was going to, the person on the phone called paramedics and police to my house and they took me to the hospital and again and the hospital detained me for about 8 hours, from midnight to 8am, I had to get one of my parents to come down and argue for them to let me go because they could potentially keep me for 72 hours.   


In both cases I was worried about not just being held involuntarily, but that no one cared that like, I see my therapist by just leaving work for an hour, or that I had to work that day at 9 am while they were keeping me awake at a hospital all night and saying they weren't going to let me leave. 

I don't work at Denny's or something, I have a 6 figure job with a staff and deadlines and stuff...I can't call in and say I'm not coming in today because I'm in a psych ward or because my therapist won't let me leave her office. 

After the incident this weekend I'm thinking of quitting my therapist because I don't trust her, and it makes me think I should never call a help hotline or anything again because essentially they kidnapped me for a night. 

They don't even try to help you anyway, they literally just detain under the threat of force. 

What can I do that is actually safer for me, like I'm sure there's places I can call outside my area and try to stay anonymous only, but for something like a live therapist or doctor... how can I be in a place where I can discuss suicide and stuff without being at risk of being arrested and losing my job as a result?"
1927,Why is it so hard to tell people I’m hurting,"My parents just sat me down and asked me why I don’t care about college, or finals, or that I’m finished with the semester, why I don’t care about registering for classes, why I never want to talk. All I can do is shrug and say I don’t know - why is it so hard to say I’m depressed? Why is it so hard to tell them I am going to kill myself in two days?"
1928,Nobody knows about my depression,"Everybody worries about my sister who gets panic attacks and insomnia

I worry about her too

But nobody cares about me, who sleeps every chance I get and is viewed as simply lazy because I didn’t ever tell anybody that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for the past five years"
1929,Just want to share my feelings with you all,"Hey everyone, this is the first time I'm writing a post on any site so I'm afraid there will be some mistakes and pardon me for that. 

I made this account on reddit maybe 1 month ago and the first thing that I did after that was joining this community, and you guys made me feel that I'm not the only one feeling tired of my life. 

I'm 18 and having sleeping issues since 2 years, everyday before sleeping I pray to god that I die in my sleep. Each and everyday I feel or get thoughts in my mind that I must do something if I want to fullfill my dreams but my anxiety and depression does not let me do anything. I get all these negative thoghts in my head and when I tell people about them they say, ""You are just thinking too much."" ""You just have a habit of making excuses."" ""Stop thinking too much."" etc. I don't remember when was the last time, I was genuinely happy. My marks were very very diappointing, I could not focus because of my mental illness. I'm repeating the exam and still I'm not able to focus on study. I'm very good looking but still I don't have a gf and the reason for that is I lack social skills very badly, I'm just an awkward introverted guy who does not know how to talk or how to flirt. I always found it hard to make friends, I don't even have a single friend anymore I'm isolated from the society, I don't want to be alone. My family don't know about my depression or maybe they do know but just don't care about it. I always wanted to become a model or actor but my family does not support me and want me to become a doctor instead. I can go on typing till eternity writing about bad shit happening to me but I think I've said enough. After writing everything I realised I missed to write about alot of of worst things. I just want someone to talk to, tell me about your problems I may not be able to help but I'm a good listener. 

Thank you, all of you."
1930,Help,"I think that I am depressed but I am to scared to tell anyone and I don't know were I go to get help.

I have no Doctor, I don't even know if I can go to a normal Doctor with depression and if I can make an appointment with a Random Doctor

Please help me.

 P S: I am sorry for Grammatical errors, for punctuation errors and Spelling mistakes."
1931,I just threw a water bottle into the wall and broke it intentionally. Has never happened before. Do you do this type of thing? How often?,"As a result, I feel angry, sad and scared. This has been triggered. Since I struggle with depression and PTSD, and I am under verbal abuse from my parent almost every day, it just got to the point that I did this. My parent is triggering me a lot. I usually trigger them when I talk back when yelled at. I am not a teenager. I am an adult. And I am moving away soon again but honestly, I feel like this incident showed me how angry and in a bad mental condition I am. So, now, I do not feel ready for moving away. Have heard that people break plates. Have you done this? What triggered it and do you do it often?"
1932,I am depressed and losing my mind everything is ruined I don’t even feel happy for Christmas and I really miss my ex,"I honestly feel nothing but sadness and I can’t let go of the past I’m starting to dislike my friends and I’m not the person I was just a few months ago. My girlfriend left me awhile ago for someone else and I have nobody. I’m a 17 year old sophomore who doesn’t have a job and can’t drive. I hate myself, I want someone to love me. I hate being this way. I hate my boring personality I really just want to die but I’m too scared to take care of that on my own. I really was at a high point in my life just last may and the summer break was the best. I saw a beautiful future with my now ex who hates me. I was gonna do graphic design and I had a friend group where I felt I belonged. I felt so successful and happy and it all went away so fast it’s such a shame. My family is a wreck. My friends are bad influences and I feel like secretly dislike me. I have absolutely nobody. I’ve had to deal with everything on my own and as a male I can’t even fucking cry in front of people because I look weak and I hate it. I really just wanna hold someone and cry in there arms without feeling degraded for it. I’m sick of where I live but there’s nothing I can do about it. I really really just want to be dead. I want to die but I don’t want to upset and fuck my family up even more. To be honest I really just want someone’s attention and I want to feel wanted and loved and I want someone to cuddle me I feel so damn lonely and everyone I ever love always leaves me. I also fucking hate how people will shove there issues in my face just to belittle what I’m going through like it’s a competition. I’m a human being and I lack physical affection and attention from other people. I need someone to hold me like a damn baby and I just want to let everything out and be set free from this feeling. I hate life."
1933,It’s that time of year again,"So for everyone who feels me, let me be the first to say it. Fuck Christmas! 🎄"
1934,How's your day going?,"I'm tired, I'm tired of waking up I'm tired of faking it up till I make it up some place, I'm tired of these bags on my face I'm tired of this I'm tired of having to race to catch my happiness.

I'm tired of talking a shower I'm tired of people saying that I have some form of power to help myself, I'm tired of taking care of my health I'm tired of not being able to be love someone.

Im tired of trying to live for others, I'm tired of being reduced by my mother I'm tired of not being able to form a  bond, I'm tired that I only feel anything is when I hit my bong
I'm tired of my life consisting of the same sad song


im tired."
1935,Today was the first day I ever called in sick because I can’t stop crying.,"Never had to take a mental health day before, but today I’m just so unbearably sad that I just can’t go to the office. I can’t stop crying."
1937,I’m a mum who is lost. My baby hurts and I feel powerless to stop it.,"Hello all, I’m new here. Please forgive any formatting and/or spelling mistakes. Sleep hasn’t been easy to come by. 

My beautiful daughter is a teen who is fighting this awful battle everyday. The enemy is invisible, attacks her even when she closes her eyes, and I’m terrified of losing her. Between the doctor visits, medications and therapy, there simply doesn’t seem to be any respite from it. If I’m feeling this drained, I can only imagine the nightmare of how she is feeling. 

We have a very strong relationship and she is comfortable in talking things through with me. I’m her mum, I will always be a safe, soft spot for her to land on and rest. I give endless hugs, stop whatever I’m doing if she needs my time, and basically make it part of our routine that I’m available 24/7. Is it 2am and she’s in crisis? I’m up in a flash to stay with her, hold her hand and listen. I have even taken a leave from work because she is my priority and I am able to financially. 

The reason I’m reaching out to you fine people is that I need to know if there is anything specific that I should be doing in addition to what I already am. My girl isn’t even beginning to surface from the murky depths. The panic attacks, the insomnia followed by days where she isn’t able to get out of bed on her own, the inability to eat an actual meal (weight loss is becoming a big issue), the crying and berating herself for “being weak” (her words), additional worries about her education because she just can’t make it through the school day...so many facets of daily life have become impossible for her. 

In patient treatment has been discussed with her doctor as well, though she begs me not to go down that road. It’s tough to know what’s the best thing for her. Do I have to push harder in some ways to help her? Do I keep doing what my heart says and listen with loving support? She calls herself weak but I always point out that her asking for help took so much strength. I do my best to show her what an amazing and strong person she is. That this disease can be treated and life can have colour again. She’s got to keep trying, even if it means that the day’s victory meant that she got a shower and dressed. 

I don’t really have a personal support system for myself as I navigate through it all. Her father makes demands of her to just take a deep breath and get on with things. Unfortunately it doesn’t work that way! I now have to supervise what and how he says things to her for obvious reasons. I’m at the mental place that dictates I’d rather her need to do a grade over vs forcing her to jump in the deep end and drown. 

So please tell me what has helped you or your loved one. My girl is precious and this world is better having her in it."
1938,Trapped in a Void,"Anyone else feel like they're trapped in a void? My mood changes depending on stress levels or just if the day is just feeling like that but I don't feel almost anything. I don't feel like doing anything, my motivation for anything is just gone. I don't think much of anything. I just feel like I'm uselessly occupying a body right now and I want to get out of this feeling. This empty feeling, this void is eating me alive and I don't know what to do to fill it. I've gotten out of this before but I don't remember how it even happened. I live my life doing nothing and I suffer for it. This needs to stop and I don't know how.


If anyone has anything to add to this or any way to address this sort of thing, I would appreciate it if anyone is willing to share."
1939,Everything feels so hopeless,I feel like there is no hope left. I just want to give up.
1940,I'm tempted to start cutting again,"I woke up late and my dad was pissed about it. He kept saying how disrespectful and irresponsible I am (despite the fact that I'm 25 and rarely wake up late, not to mention that I've held down this job for almost 6 years). He threatened to take my phone and when I told him I would leave it at work if that was the case, he responded that he would just shut it off. I'm just not sure what I should do.
And before people start telling me to move out, I'm disabled and my dad takes every paycheck (aside from $40) in order to pay bills and so we can just live. I'm not sure what to do and I can't take this anymore."
1941,How to help support my partner as much as possible?,"She’s having a hard time with her depression and isn’t finding anything enjoyable lately. She’s got a great new job but since she’s new she’s got a lot of anxiety about it.

She works very hard and just doesn’t have enough time to relax as there’s  always so much to do.

I think she’s going to talk to her doctor about it. She’s feeling so overwhelmed and like there’s no point or purpose to anything and she just doesn’t want to work.

If I could I’d totally just take care of everything but I definitely don’t earn enough money for that. I do however do all the household chores, errands and most of the cooking which I actually enjoy doing!  

She also doesn’t have any family support as her father is abusive and her mum died so other than me she’s kind of alone minus some friends who have their own lives to deal with.

I try to plan fun cheap dates often but  she’s not enjoying them lately and is just so tired all the time.

What else can I do to help?"
1942,What's the point?,"I have been having ups and downs but I'm getting to the point of what the fuck is the point of trying?

I work 5 days a week and then I'm lonely at the weekends. Doing the same things, I think I need therapy as I dont feel like I'm good enough, like everyone else is happy, in relationships and I'm just stuck in pointless weekly cycle.

I hate myself and I thought I would get better but I've been on and off medication for years. I need to do something to make life worth living, do something to break the isolated self loathing cycle.

I honestly feel like I cant do this on my own and sometimes just want to end it.

Recently I have been thinking what is the point of continuing this, if this is all that going to happen for the next 20+ years."
1943,Repeating,"It was a Monday and she lay in bed,
It’s no good, she would rather be dead. 
As melodramatic as that may seem 
Her mind is nothing but an endless scream.

She forces herself up and into the shower,
Feeling alive needs hot water and scour. 
Tears washed away with the soapy water,
Remembers that she’s someone’s daughter.

Throughout the day, she holds her smile
A pleasant person to speak a while.
At home, the sadness, the fear, the doubt,
Hurting the husband she can’t live without. 

She promises herself, to see all the shades
She knows that with time, immediacy fades.
She falls asleep with thoughts of when,
To wake up tomorrow and repeat it again."
1944,Extreme hopelessness,"Does talking to people even work? It doesn’t. What’s the point? It won’t solve my problems. I need help but I’m the reason I’m having problems. No one to blame but me. So what right do I have to complain. I need to change but I either can’t or won’t. Either way it doesn’t seem to be happening. I thought it was but I was only fooling myself. In the end I’m nothing but a worthless POS. I think I might kms. Except I’m just saying that. I probably won’t. So it’s pointless. I want to die but won’t kill my self. I want to change but can’t or won’t. Talking doesn’t help. Therapy costs too much. I could make money but I never go to work?  

Do I have adhd? Am I depressed? Does it matter? All that matters is that I flake on work and don’t make enough and then complain like it’s not my fault.  When it is. Why can’t I just go? Why am I like this? Why was I born ? 
It’s just a cycle. If I don’t kill my self it won’t end. I have to."
1945,I wish i was beautiful!,"Please stop making motivation comments like eveyone is beautiful in thier own way.. fucking stop.. 
Im ugly and i know it. I wonder why god made many people beautiful still some of unfortunate souls like me superb ugly.. :( everything about life is unfair"
1947,I like how this episode of Tom and Jerry depicts real life depression really well,https://youtu.be/K2yUIkaM2Nw
1948,Adhd medication for another use,"TL;DR  -  Dont rely only on medication to fix your life for you



Okey so to make a long story short, i have been struggeling with depression for many years, and in march of this year i got professional help, and ended up being diagnosed with adhd, i soon got medication wich helped me so much with my chronic ""lazyness"" and i started getting my shit in a bag and my life going, buuut i couldt sustain that life.

I see now that adhd was merely the tip or my horrible iceberg, and that i was being rushed through the system too quickly.

I am now depressed again, probably more than ever, after falling back yet again, but i feel now how insanely much how then medication masked my true feelings.

Its night and day from the moment take my medication and all my worries goes away, till the evening when i feel absolute shit and i wanna commit suicide.

Dont know the message i want to deliver really, just that dont trust that a medication will fix your life for you, i know it didnt for me."
1950,I woke up today and the first thing I thought is what tf am I doing with my life,I’m so tired of depression taking over every aspect of my life it’s come to a point where I’m actually angry about it. I have this new-found surge of motivation that I hope lasts long enough for me to make changes.
1951,Tormenting my wife.,"I’m so tired of tormenting my wife. I can’t decided to stay in our marriage or leave. Our marriage isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty damn good and she is an amazing woman. Most of the issues arise from me. Most, probably all. I’m just so sick of hurting her. It fucking sucks. I feel like a monster. I know it’s because I’m depressed. But I feel she deserves better, or at least life without me hurting her all her days. She acts like it’s fine and no big deal. Says roles my switch someday. But I’m too fucked up, and she is too put together. We just don’t jive like we should. I feel terrible. Any input?"
1952,Self medicating?,"I have been clinically depressed for over a year now and things have been up and down but mostly good so far. I take anti depressants and so far they have worked great for the most part. Unfortunately my wife had a miscarriage two weeks ago and things have been quite hard for both of us. To keep my mind from spiraling, I decided to purchase some marijuana to make me laugh and keep me occupied during this hard time. Do you think that is okay? So far it has worked for me. It has kept me occupied while watching a movie or playing a video game. I live in Arkansas where medical marijuana is legal. Should I talk to my dr about getting a prescription? Is there any research confirming that medical marijuana helps Sith depression? let me know your thoughts. Thanks"
1953,long time antidepressant use,"Any long time anti depressants users here? My story is i am 45 with a life long ever since teenage years depression but i always tried to stay on the bright side but recently broke and am diagnosed severe depression GAD, i have no choice i am broken and need help which include meds, so i like to know how long term 1-2 years med would affect a person. I dont plan to be on them for long i hope."
1954,Oh jesus please! Im tired of this life.,I have zero self esteem because i feel im ugly :( i dont know.. i want to laugh and smile like everyone else do but i feels like im ugly.  People will find me superb ugly.. :( maybe im really ugly or my perception about life is wrong?
1955,how can I deal with a bff loss?,"Hi, so I met this girl online on PS4, after matching with her randomly.. we had fun and I added her.
not even a month passed by, and we had already over 20k messages. we used to talk a lot, and since I met her, I almost only played with her on my PS4, I became so attached to her and we kept telling each others secrets. talking in vocal parties, or video calls. most of the time I fall asleep during a call with her, or whilst texting her (and vice-versa) because we stay up all night ( we had 7 hours difference because of different timezones )..
we always make each other laugh and talk about how we'll meet one day etc.
one day, she was joking with me publicly and said I'm gay because I spend a lot of time with my best friend IRL. then I saw her write "" I'll give you my spot for 1$ "" to someone on a youtube streaming. I said "" 1$ for 1 night?, you're cheap "". I thought I was joking but then I realized that I kinda crossed the line right there.
it was last wednesday, she said good bye and left the stream. ignored me for 2 days and then asked me to remove her account from my PS4. 
and the next day, she deleted me. like nothing happened. 
I said sorry a billion times but then she said I'll never forgive you for disrespecting me. I just wish that day never happened and I had never sent her the streaming link. first day after she deleted me I got drunk af, and I can barely see, hit the wall so hard with my hand, it was bleeding. 
how can I move on? I don't know, I considered her as my best friend (might've even had a little crush on her) and I can't forgive myself about what I did, it was never my intention to disrespect her. I feel emptiness.. I was planning to meet her next summer but now I just can't fill the void she has left. maybe it's easy for her to forget me as she has a lot of male friends, but for me I have never dealt with such a thing. 
I feel like I'm burning from the inside, not in the mood to touch my PS4 anymore as it reminds me of her. any idea on how to move on? we've been best friends for 1 year and I used to wake up to her good mornings everyday. I'm depressed."
1956,"My loving, happy and optimistic girlfriend is depressed.","I met my girlfriend at university 8 years ago and she was  such a happy person, anything was possible and she'd deal with problems as well as she could.

After us both graduating she's had a couple of poor places of employment and she used to come home crying and slept a lot, stopped doing work around the house and almost quit without a job lined up. Through this, I supported her as much as possible, I took on a lot of the house work, cooking and cleaning. Then she found a new job which she tells me she enjoys but always dwells on mistakes and compares herself to people who have been in that position for years. 

She has become a recluse and always craves time to relax at weekends and evenings after work and complains when we have to go out as well as complains when she has been unproductive in her free time.

She's registered for counselling but they've decided she should do some type of online course instead of face to face counselling? She also bought a gratitude diary to write in every night.

It's awful to see someone who was so loving, happy and positive turn into a person who just watches TV when she gets in from work and complains about everything she has to do and everything that has went wrong. she used to have a high sex drive and now she never wants any sex, either. This is really tiring as I've suffered with depression and bad anxiety in the past and it's pulling me down. I don't know what else to do!

Please, any advice at all would be hugely appreciated!

Summary: happy, loving girlfriend has had some bad experiences and has continually spiraled downwards into depression over 2-3 years. Not sure how to help anymore. Need advice!"
1957,Do you feel more depressed after talking to someone trusted about your feelings and hardships?,"Don't know if this is just happening to me. I started feeling even more depressed after talking to a counsellor about some personal problems, and when one of my teachers asked me if i was ok, it also causes my depressive thoughts and feelings to 'flare up'. Is this because i've withheld my feelings for so long? or because anything else?"
1958,Friend made a suicide note 8 hours ago and I don’t know what to do,"He left his phone password and computer info and told us to let his ex-girlfriend be happy, and to not blame her for what happens to him. He made it 8 hours ago and I don’t know if he’s at home or what. He left an story of train track but I don’t know where. I am really scared for his safety but I don’t know what to do"
1959,Does anyone on here like anger?,"I know anger is bad in many situations. But, sometimes anger makes me super motivated, not depressed, and it just makes me aggravated enough to change my life."
1960,How does one get out of depression with no resources?,"I have no family, friends, insurance, and very little money.  Not sure there's any sort of path out."
1962,My grandpa just passed,"I’m in shock, feeling everything and nothing at the same time. I just saw him last night."
1963,I just realized that I don’t have any friends,"There were these two people who I considered my best friends but, I was just lying to myself. They both treat me like I’m just being over dramatic with my problems and they act like my problems are completely insignificant compared to theirs and like only their problems matter. I have tried talking to them about my problems but they just bring the conversation back to themselves. I’m just their sounding board ig. I don’t have any real conversations with them and honestly I don’t really want to anymore. I’m kind of sick of it after ignoring it for so long.

So now I know. I don’t have friends. I don’t have anyone to talk to. I’m completely alone on this earth.

The only thing that keeps me going is knowing that I have God here with me. Other than that..."
1964,My life feels unrewarding,"Lately I've done a lot that I can't say I'm proud of. And I only did those things because I tought I would feel rewarded for all the effort I put into studying.
We have exams this week here and I've been studying with a lot of focus on it but it's been difficult to keep it up lately because I can't find motivation to keep doing so. I know I could say that my grades going up would be a good reward but it just doesn't feel like it in the moment. With family and friends distracting me and being a bit unhelpful lately it's been difficult. When I do tell them about how I feel they start thinking I am a generally angry person and  it just makes me hate myself. 

I put a lot of effort into many things, but it seems after the first few times I just can't find any more motivations. The good things I do just feel unrewarding.

I know my problem probably seems small compared to other's, but I would just like to know if you have any ways to help with this. I just found out about this subreddit today, so I apologize for anything wrong that I do."
1966,"[UPDATE] My GF with depression, anxiety &amp; bipolar has asked for space...","Link back to the old post:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e95hmr/my\_gf\_with\_depression\_anxiety\_bipolar\_has\_asked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e95hmr/my_gf_with_depression_anxiety_bipolar_has_asked/) 

&amp;#x200B;

 UPDATE: She read the letter but it's no good. ""Thanks for the letter, but please understand that I am not up for a friendship or keeping a conversation. I am severely depressed and I don't need extra stress in my life. I know I'm being harsh but please just let it be"".

Obviously, this killed me inside, yet we're still friends on Social media and she still follows my posts/stories. I spoke to my cousin and my aunt and they said that I just need to give her time and space and I can contact her again sometime in January and see how shes doing. According to my aunt (who's read up on studies about BP Depression since my cousin is the same) told me that she only means that she cannot maintain a regular friendship right now while she's battling. She most likely doesn't want to end our friendship permanently but she cannot treat me as a friend now. Part of her depression right now I have a feeling is because of this break-up, as she seemed genuinely happy with me and the pressure from her family to keep me only made things harder for her.

I'm deeply in love with her, and I'd gladly trade lives with her if it meant getting rid of her condition. People keep asking me if I am okay with being with someone like this, and I've already answered this question multiple times. I wouldn't have continued dating her if I wasn't already okay. She told me about her condition on our first date. I knew from my cousin how hard it's going to be but I was prepared. I just hope we can meet up again next year maybe around Feb-March and talk again. Ill most likely NOT try to get back with her as it isn't the best thing for her right now, but down the line maybe sometime mid 2020, I'd be happy to give it a 2nd chance.

I'm still in a bit of pain, especially before my Birthday &amp; Christmas right around the corner. I'm going to try and move on but I won't be rushing it. 

Thank you for reading my story and for giving me any advice."
1967,"I’m new to Reddit and I need to reach out. This is my first time reaching out to anyone. I have been depressed for a long time, and I am exhausted.","I’m not really sure what to do or where to even turn to next (if there’s anywhere to even turn). I have been depressed for years. I have had some happy moments in between, but they will usually get shadowed by my depression that’s always lingering. For awhile now I’ve been able to hide it pretty well- put on a happy face and just push through... I’m still trying, but I can’t just put on a happy face anymore. My depression is now affecting my life more than just in my head. I recently left a secure job (that wasn’t terrible to be at) because I listened to my depression. I got a new job just to quit that one 2 weeks later because I didn’t like feeling anxious (so I listened to my depression that I needed to just go that it was never going to get better), I broke off my almost 9 year relationship with a great man who has been through a lot with me (because even though he is always there for me my depression tells me he’s not and he’s better off without me and my ‘drama’)(but he isn’t giving up on me that easy, and idk why), I’ve pushed away almost any friend that meant something to me (because I’ve told myself they don’t want to be burdened with me, or my problems), and I barely talk to any of my family (let alone let them in on how bad I’ve been feeling). I feel anxious when I need to go somewhere, so I don’t go out much. I feel so trapped in my house sometimes. I used to love to hike, garden, write, color, listen to music, watch movies, interact with people, and take my dog for walks. Now, I just want to sit in my misery, alone and in silence. I have contemplated suicide many times, but I’ve always been a chicken shit (always feared I’d fail at that too). So now most days I wake up mad that I even woke up. I don’t want to feel like this anymore, I’m exhausted. I don’t know what to do or where to turn to next. I want to see the positive, happy, and worth-living side of life... but it always becomes shaded by my depression and I lose sight."
1968,Please help me,I can’t stop crying WHY EONT SOMEONE HELP ME???
1969,Thinking positive doesn't work at all,"Is one of the biggest lie human has created
I tried but shit didn't change
""Mh uou shoul try harder""
Mhh fuck you

Man I hope to die everynight, sometimes i try to put something on my face and push down but I can't finish cause I can't do shit"
1970,Thoughts?,"
It’s as if you’re over exited like something crazy just happened, like a lifted feeling except it’s fear and internal screaming coming from the deepest part of your body. Like a rush almost. Something trying to escape. A whole body rage. 
Crying, kicking all held inside. 
Not knowing who I am. Why I do things I do. 
Can’t stand eating. 
The little things

Thoughts?"
1971,"My dad keeps asking me what I want for Christmas, all I really want is to feel like life is worth living again","He still spoils me even though I don't deserve anything. I guess there's a couple of games I want but apart from that, there's no need to go over the top. Along with Valentine's Day, Christmas mostly serves as a reminder of how empty and lonely I really am. Even though I don't mind the company, my older brother inviting his girlfriend round with her son these past two years at Christmas is a reminder to me that I've gone yet another year of being by myself and having not connected with anyone else. As it stands, I'm looking like the black sheep of the family because I'm pretty sure everyone else will get married and I'll end up being the one everyone feels sorry for at family functions. Somtimes I wish I could see if my death would matter to people I know or have known, or if they would get over it in a short period of time.

Merry Christmas..."
1972,My armor against me.,"Numbness is setting in again and I’m tempted to go back to embracing it.  It’s a defense mechanism against facing everything head on, but i still remember what it did to my life and I’m not yet aware of what it would target this time if I were to succumb.  I desperately want to feel better, and start something that will be forever for me.  I want to wake up every morning knowing that something positive in my life will be there for good.  This line of thinking makes me feel unappreciative of my family.  What I think I really mean is I want to have something that I had to work for, and therefore cherish in a different way than family.  I may have plenty of appreciation from family for little effort, but I feel like a fraud for accepting that sort of praise.  I feel that they must have very low standards of success, and that my misery must be masked pretty well for them to not seem to register it.  It feels like aside from mom, they think my depression is just a cute little reminder that makes me a little bit sad when I happen to think about what’s transpired these last few years.  When in reality it feels more like a steel suit that makes me move slower.  Slower from feeling any different.  The thing is, the suit isn’t even protective, because atop it sits a colossal funnel meant for collecting doubt and dread, and conveniently features a filter to keep out happy ideas, because god for bid I get to enjoy a second of serene, scenic slo-mo.  My suit hides my heart, yet bares my ass.  Any impressions made from within this suit are almost certainly against my intention.  This way of “living” truly feels worse than death at times.  Guilt has kept me from tapping out and I am logically, though not always emotionally thankful for that.  I’m finding that writing seems to be my pinhole escape from the confines of this hull I exist in, so I release these syllables to the wind in hopes they reach someone in a more dire panic than myself, and relating to my feelings be a consolation felt before it’s too late."
1973,Help me lie about my pills,Do i took some pills and it didn't work and i use those pills everyday and i took about a weeks dose and i know that mom gonna question me as to where they went.
1974,Feeling so down,Usually music is a good coping mechanism for my depression and anxiety but it hasn’t been working 😣 really need new ways to cope
1975,"I'm so incredibly unhappy and alone, and bad things keep happening to me. I feel like I'm going to have a mental breakdown soon.","I wrote about my general issues at another sub, and I think it might be best for people here to read about it before going into this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/e3glao/my_life_is_a_series_of_failures_and_i_feel_anger/

I'm feel extremely down lately. Well, actually, I've been feeling this way for years but it's been getting worse and worse. I recently went to the doctor, and she was so happy because I lost 50 pounds in about 8 months. I was surprised I lost so much weight, but I think a part of it was that I've been eating less because I feel unhappy, don't go out as much due to having no one to be with, and all that. It doesn't help that despite my diet and exercise, I still get made fun of. 

I did go out yesterday to eat at a restaurant. Of course, I am alone. I usually am. In the table beside me sat a group of women around my age. As soon as I sat down, they all began to laugh. One woman went ""Gee, I felt an earthquake when she sat in that chair."" The other went ""Surprised it didn't break."" It was pretty cruel. Despite my 'progress', I am still berated and people act like I am garbage. Everybody, including on Reddit, has assured me that losing weight will earn me respect, more chances to socialize, etc etc etc. It doesn't feel that way. 

All my efforts to improve end up failing in one way or another.

I also ended up being conned. I'll spare this sub the details, but I signed up for a clean energy program that was supposed to assist in helping the environment and also save me money on my electric bills. Turns out my electric bill tripled. I've been trying to get it sorted out but both that company and my main electric company are basically ""Too bad, so sad, moron"" about it. It adds to my depression and despair.

It's one bad thing after another after another. Plus I am dealing with all of this alone. I have no support system, just people telling me that I am worthless, ugly, fat, stupid, and so on. I'm not suicidal because I am too afraid to ever kill myself and because I keep having this flicker of hope that life might get better...even though it never does. 

I feel hopeless, and sad, and angry."
1976,"At the edge of a cliff looking down, looking back and forth at the people reaching out","I can’t remember the last time I’ve felt so low. I was doing really good. I was. I had three jobs and was going to school fulltime. Then I let myself fall, so deep into this abyss and I can’t get out. I wake up in a panic almost every morning. I wake up every morning wishing I wasn’t here. The only comfort I find is being in bed. Sleep is the only thing I can get that’s close to death. It’s like I can tune out from everything. I can force myself to go to sleep, no matter what time of the day it is. I’m scared, I’m lonely. People are getting concerned and I don’t care anymore. I just don’t care, and that’s what’s so scary. The other day I got out of the house and had a spa day. It was really nice, but after about 5 hours I needed to get home and seclude myself. It was too much life for me, even though it was supposed to be relaxing. The suicidal thoughts? Ha. They’re so bad, but that’s another thing to talk about. Which I’d rather not tbh. How the hell do I save myself? If I even want to be saved. I’ve done enough saving myself and others, I feel like it’s time for me to log the fuck out of life, but I can’t."
1977,Am I Depressed?,"For a while I have been feeling empty, like the things I normally enjoy just don't. Don't do anything for me. Sometimes I even feel pissed off from looking at certain memes or something. Even my favourite show, South Park. No. No reaction. Video games, nothing, except for the feeling that I am bad at all the games I play, even after doing so for years.


Sometimes, only at night, alone, I feel really sad, I wish I could just go back to when I was little, everything was good back then. I had friends, I was thought of highly, but now I just feel like an outcast and got kicked out of my friend group because of a series of problems. One of them smashed my watch and they all laughed about it right in front of my fucking face. High school is tough, I may be well off financially and I have a loving family but I feel hopeless, I suck at everything I try, motivation is at 0.


I'm only 13, but I think I may be depressed. I've taken online tests, but they aren't really reliable. Once I turned to alcohol and that is probably the first time in a year I had felt happy for an extended period of time. Most of the time I feel sad or empty. Just nothing. I haven't really laughed my ass off at a joke, meme, video, TV show e.t.c since 2017. I did think about suicide, once, but I'm worried about what's on the other side. It could be hell, it could be nothing, I don't know. I'm thinking about trying weed with a friend but that is just a cowardly escape.


I don't know, am I depressed or do I just think I am because it's 'cool' or 'edgy' or something. I know other people my age who are ""depressed"" with huge quotation marks, and I don't wanna be one of those people, so, am I, or just a fake depressed idiot who thinks it's cool. Only asking because I don't want to look like a dumbass when my doctor says I don't have depression."
1978,I know this ain't as big deal as everyone else's problem...help,"Well, I had this friend (female) whom I chatted with nsfw stuff ( we send memes and sometimes other things like links) while I have a gf. So that happened and when my gf knew about it and sht happened. 
Now me and my girl are kinda okay? Or are we? Everytime she remembers it, all hell breaks loose. I don't know what to do with my life now. I am really considering suicide but I am too scared of what will happen next. I am tired. I still love her. But I can't just erase everything easily. I really dont know what to do. Help? I don't even know where to post this haha."
1979,"My partner is suffering from depression, I need help decoding her message","Just a little background, my girlfriend and I broke up more than a month ago because her plate was currently full and there are times where I'll fail to understand her or times where I'm too stressed to absorb all her negative energy and be her happy pill so sometimes it leads to fights until she got to a breaking point where all her problems were currently at their peak and I had a really bad day and we just clashed. We talked a bit and agreed to break up because we currently have our issues we need to fix first and because we wanted to try again someday so we don't want to destroy the relationship beyond repair. She's suffering from depression for years now and we had a good amount of time where she didn't feel depressed but it didn't last long due to a very toxic work environment which affected our relationship a bit too much. Obviously. 

Fast forward to the present, I still talk to her regularly although it's expected to not be the usual normal cheerful way couples talk and instead it's mostly me just being there for her because she's feeling really sad.

Therr are times where she'll just be straight up really mad at the world including me (I've hurt her a lot of times too admittedly and I started the fight which led to the breakup) and she'll just say something like ""Why are you still bothering me?"", ""I'm not worth it."", ""Leave me alone."", ""You should have left my life alone."", etc and I honestly don't know what should be the right response so I just tell her thst I'll still be beside her and that she's not alone but since she has depression it's going to take more than those words to make her feel she's not alone.

Also, when she's extremely angry or sad she says something about being really tired, wanting to quit, and that I should stop bothering with her and just leave her alone. She says all these in an angry kind of way so I don't know if she really mean it that I'm adding stress by trying to talk to her or she's just pushing me away because of depression. I don't know what to say especially during those times. Should I really give her some space and not initiate conversations or be stubborn and stay with her even if she keeps telling me not to because there are times where I couldn't still be there for her hence sometimes there are false hopes? Take note that she's really alone, only her best friend and me are there for her because her parents aren't that keen to mental health issues and they're not really the great kinds of parents. So I fear that if I stop initiating conversations, she'll feel even more alone especially since she's isolated and leaving alone with suicidal tendencies lately by how she says she just wants to give uo especially since she just quit her job which was good because of the toxic environment there.

I really just want her to heal and be happy. Even if we don't get to try again. As long she's safe from suicidal tendencies and she gets to heal and achieve her dreams, I'll be really happy even if I'm not part of her lifr anymore, I really just want to help her."
1980,someone said something to me on a post that i thought was a little harsh and now i’m crying,why am i so sensitive i feel like everyone is mean to me and now i’m crying over a single sentence a stranger said to me on the fucking dogs subreddit
1981,Spending my 18th birthday alone,"Last year when I turned 17 I had a small house party with about 25 people over. All good friends of mine except for a few people, it seemed like everyone had a lot of fun except for me. Right now I’m only in touch with 3 of them because I cut most of them off during a really bad time of my life, around February this year. I didn’t think about it much back then, because friends come and go and it’s not like I cut them off for absolutely no reason, they had hurt me and abandoned me at the time I needed them most and it felt right. Around that time, I also started realizing that my then therapist wasn’t really paying attention to me and she only offered to consult me about once every 3 months which was not enough for the state I was in.  I’m terribly scared of change though and she was my therapist for 3-4 years + the person to diagnose me with depression so I admit I felt like I should stick with her. Feel like I should add that at some point she told me there’s no true hope for me because the way I think and my character itself is depressive, not only because of my illness. Still have no idea what tf she meant by that lol but I can’t stop thinking about it.

Forward to now, I started my first year in college and expected to make new friends naturally but that never really happened. I stopped going to college within the first months because I was dissatisfied with my major and I was so fucking depressed I couldn’t even get out of bed to go grocery shopping for myself. Finally changed doctors and started new meds and it feels kind of right, I’m happy with my new doctor. I had a hard time with the side effects of the new meds and I have to take like 4 of them a day but other than that I’m hopeful. So I currently hang out with the 3 people I’m still in touch with and 2 other people I met through them. I tried to reconnect with my ex best friend and apologize to her for cutting her off and she was so kind about it, it made my whole week. We met up and we’re talking regularly again but something doesn’t sit right with me, I feel like I don’t have anything to talk about and it’s completely not her fault, I just feel like my life is so empty that there’s really nothing to converse about. 

I don’t know what happened to me, I used to be socially adept despite my anxiety, I used to be able to make people around me feel comfortable and happy that they’re hanging out with me. I feel like I grew into a weirdo that no one wants to be around with because of how silent I am all the time. I’m in a constant state of apathy to my surroundings. I can’t even fake it till I make it anymore lol. So today is my birthday and I am 18 and I am most likely going to spend it alone because I feel like my 3 close friends are fucking growing tired of being my only friends and the only people I talk to anymore. I don’t know if I should try to start over and learn how to make friends from scratch again. I wish someone could convince me that this is temporary but I’ve been trying to tell myself that this is just an unfortunate but transitional phase for a year now. I’m not transitioning to shit, I’m spending my birthday making a long reddit post."
1982,What I want for Christmas? Is to be fixed..,"It seems like I don’t have any Christmas spirit this year...and every thing keeps getting worse for me...I lost someone I really loved because of my depression..

Every year I get sadder and sadder and I don’t want to contribute to anything anymore...I really want to get better and be myself again by going back to therapy but my parents won’t let me go because they don’t believe I have depression and just want attention. I’m not a horrible kid I just want help.. 

What I want is to be happy again and get the help I need for Christmas..

I feel so trapped..I’m gonna lose everything because of my mental problem..I want help"
1983,"Last week I watched my grandma die horribly, I just hit my 4 month anniversary of being homeless, and my chronic constipation is getting so unmanageable that I think people can smell it. I am gods broken mistake. I am a rotten shell. I am a crying, blubbering, dirty, gutter dwelling waste of flesh",Idk. I've never wanted to kill myself this much
1984,Just got the worst secret Santa gift.,"A damn deodorant and a snickers -.-
This isn't even 2$ and he didn't think about it at all. It reminds me of how much everyone hates me, and gives me another reason to hate everyone.
Fuck you, highschool classmates"
1985,I'll never be understood,"I'm done with life.  I've been for a while now.  December's been the worst month of my life for mental health.  I can't go a few hours without feeling like suicide is the only way.  The worst part?  I have no one.  I have no one around me because I'm a terrible person, and I'm meant to die.  I try to post here on various subs I've been a part of.  I'm trying to let them know that I'm not okay.  That I need a sign that I'm worth the fight.  Most of the comments are people saying I'm fake.  I repeat posts for attention.  They don't understand that it's an ongoing problem.  That getting professional help is not easy, cheap, and it doesn't feel effective.  No one's ever going to understand.  That's why I don't know if I can keep going.  This is hell.  This is my worst nightmare.  I'm slowly losing everything"
1986,Why does it feel like everything's out to fucking get me,Fucking pisses me off. Feels like someone's intentionally fucking with me to make everything bad. Lifes fucking retarded
1987,having suicide as plan B is comforting,it doesn't matter how much I fuck up because suicide is an option.
1988,got drunk and embarassed myself,"i know this isnt a real problem, but ive got social anxiety and phobia so listening to people make fun of me because of dumb stuff i did while i was drunk makes me wanna die. 

im a super boring and embarassing person when im sober and its depressing to think that im still like that while drunk. idk i wish i could be normal"
1989,Depression has robbed me of everything good in my life,"Everything and everyone that I once loved besides my immediate family has left me. Everything that has gone wrong is almost a direct result of my depression. Almost all of my pain and suffering is caused by this. I feel like I have nothing. Everything that was once good is now gone.

I wished that depression would take it easy on me but it’s been nothing but ruthless and pure evil."
1990,breakups suck,after breaking up with my last gf i feel so emotionally unavailable i’ve tried to date a few girls but i just can’t seem to connect with them or anyone anymore i used to able to have meaningless hookups here and there but now all i feel afterwards it’s emptiness i just want a connection with someone and it’s honestly so hard after putting so much effort to connect with someone before for them to break up with you without really giving you a reason
1991,Money,"It's pretty sad that most of the popular ways to kill yourself still require you to spend money, E.X. gun. Shows how little you can do at all without money and how almost everything is determined by money. Fucking stupid."
1992,Honest Question,"Honest question, why isnt it ok to cut yourself? 

I understand that talking to professionals is important, and I'm working on that, but what's so wrong with this? I sterilize the area and the tool before every time. I clean up afterwards and bandage. I don't care about the scars at all. 

As long as I'm talking to professionals and I'm clean about it, I dont understand why everyone freaks out when they find out why I do it so often. I don't understand why it's so odd. I don't understand."
1993,Stop your whining,Your not depressed. Stop it people.
1994,Feeling Sick of Everything,"19F, no job since 11th grade. I want to get better, take better care of myself and get more active and slim, make new friends but I just can't seem to?

I'm constantly tired of everything. I hate myself and my body more than anything else in the world. I wanna make friends but I've isolated myself from people for so long due to bullying and abuse and social anxiety. I just cajt feel comfortable around people anymore.

I feel like everyone in my family hates my pressence. Its why I lock myself in my room and barely come out. They hate I don't have a job like my older brother. My sisters constantly make fun of me and talk about hiw much they can't wait for me to be gone. Then when I get defensive or upset my parents don't do anything or they aling with my sisters make fun of me more.

Idk what to do anymore. The threat of getting thrown out is looming over me. I wish I could just disappear.."
1995,I'm gonna get the help I need.,"I keep getting distracted by my xbox, and i play all day and by the end of the day I'm so upset with myself.  I cut the cord.  I'm determined.  I need to get the help, I need to push myself.  I'm going do it."

1998,My life of ups and downs,"Warning in advance, this is a long one. Slip to the end If you want the tldr version

So in order to ask for advice I feel I need to give a little backstory of my situation. I'm a 25 year old man who up until recently when I finally straightened my life around. When I say my life was in shambles, I was selling dope at 16 and popping so many xanax that I went on a binge and blacked out for an entire week. People think this is a blatant lie whenever I tell this shameful story but it's TRUE, I'm still dealing with the side effects of bar coma.  For a long time I had full body tremors, please nobody take offense to this but my cousin has torrets and he saw me twitching one day and nearly made me to to see his doctor because he was that concerned.

BY 21 I was addicted to smoking heroin (I never shot that crap, I hate needles. I even hate watching people shoot up because its kinds terrifying. I was now doing  anything I could get my hands on (no crack or meth though, I really dont like uppers. I much prefer downers) I was wasting my life away because i was going in and out of jail which totally made my depression worse since mental health counseling dosnt exist in tdcj. I could have used my intelligence to help benefit society at least to improve the human race somehow. but I chose a temporary feeling over the feeling of having achieved something great in life,or built, or drawn. something or even won an episode of Hells Kitchen! but currently I'm just being a general waste on society.

At 24 years old on june 7th 2018 i said enough is enough and decided to get clean and sober for good this time, not one of those ""well I'll officially be done after my last hit"" bullshit. Nah, this was cood Turkey just sweating bullets and trying to max out my xbox gamerscore since I felt like I was physically dying so there's not much else to do. Then the depression kicked in. I've never felt so low in my life than when I was goin through heroin withdrawls. It's truly a weird feeling wanting to die just because your going crazy for not being able to sleep and anything you eat just ends up being thrown up. But its the price I had to pay for messing with that horrid substance. If any of you gentleman/gentlewoman are reading this and thinking ""ahh snorting one line wont do anything, trust me the road only gets longer snd longer. 

Through all this my father was very supportive. Hed been through somethin similar in Vietnam and he prepared me for what to expect and what I needed to buy and also items to stay away from.

My mother knew none of this because she was raised in a very closed off household, like no tv, all her teachers where nuns. She still has scars on the top of her hands from being hit with a ruler or whatever was in reach.  the only books they where around to read are the bible, stuff like that you know? I've seen her try and physically assault a man smoking a joint in amnsterdam because all her life she was told how evil the drug is and all that nonsense. It's insane right? Insane as in those old school anti marijuana ads from probably the 50's-late70's I cant tell you how many fights we've gotten into because she used to hit me with a closed fist when she'd catch me smoking from one of those cheap 5 dollar pipes youd get at a gas station. When I'd watch the woman take a xanax and wash it down with a glass of wine.  At. 11am. In.The.morning. I guess this was back in the days of the pill mills because I have no idea how she had literally 15-20 fuol to half full bottles of xanax because ""I'm a failure and she dosnt understand why I csnt be like my sister"" 

So when I initially approached my dad and was truthful with him about my heroin addiction he didnt seem angry with me, which I thought was slightly weird.  He told me to sit down and wed discuss our next plan of actions. He told me ""son from the moment you where born I promised to god that nothing would come between you and my love and I refuse to give up on you now"" my dad continued to tell me about my mothers upbringing and how she would essentially disown/shun me for the remainder of my life since she still believed in this ridiculous brainwashing horeshit. So my dad and I decided was him and I would go on a father sun ""vacation"" but in reality I went to a rehab program in houston texas. My dad truly is the best man in the world, even though he lived 3 houre away from my rehab he still came every single day and ate dinner with me. I truly wish I could do something or just anything to make it yo for him. I want him to know that my love for him is undying and that even though we have butted heads in thr past, hes my roll model and who I look up to.  My mom on the other hand was on one of her usual xanax benders so who knows if she even realized we had left the house let alone the state. I honestly feel like her neglect has caused some of my problems that I deal with as an adult. Especially trust. My parents are pretty wealthy but since my moms a lill popper and constantly in party mode with her ""girlfriends"" I was never tought how to spot people who want the genuine best for you and the other majority who see me on my for thr cash in my pocket. That definately caused many many broken hearts and destroyed friendships because i was too naive and trusting in everybody's good nature.

After about 2 weeks of hell I was finally free to return to my normal life. While i was in rehab i decided it would be best if i stayed in Houston becausr i didnt know anybody so it's not as easy to pick up dope from. I got a good job through a friend i met in my program and life started improving dramatically (who woulda thought?) My relationship with my parents drastically improved, probably not lying and stealing to fund a stupid enslaving habbit helped a lot lol. But once I got off the dope the depression kicked in like a jack hammer. I couldnt eat, I had no sex drive, I mean I didnt even have the willpower to speak to a member of the other gender. I was to the point where I'd rather just go home and play Playstation 4 or outer worlds on xbox one (if anybody would like to play with me dont hesitate to message me. We can get through this permanent heartache together)

Now flash forward to 2 days ago, my depression is somewhat under control. I still have my days where I just wake up and know it's going to be one of those days? Where as other days I feel like there has never been a more incredible day that this earth has seen. My mom calls me out of the blue and asks the typical christmas questions like ""what do you want for your present"" ""have you bought your sister anything"" and just asking me to bring some food for christmas dinner with the whole family. We talked about just normal mom and son stuff you know? I tried to explain the status of the Imperium of Man in the 41st millennium to her"" she said she understood but I dont think I'm too great of a story teller for her to grasp the concept lol"" we end the call by making plans for Tuesday night to have dinner since she was gone on thanksgiving and we where unable to see each other since she was visiting my dog.

We ended the phone and I start playing god of war, you know just taking my son on an adventure he'll never forget. I mean who sees the world serpent) and about that time I get a text from my mom saying "" I owe you an apology. I'm sorry but I don't know if I can have you here in the house for Christmas.  I need to think about it a bit..  Give me a few days. I'm sorry for speaking before thinking. Probably why I'm still awake. Love you. See you Tuesday.,"" this was all apparently because I was smoking heroin over a year and a half ago. I even offered to take a blood test, urine sample, or she could pull some or my hair but apparently that wasnt good enough and I dont know what to do. I havnt toughed drugs or alcohol since June 7th, 2018 ( I'm not gonna lie to you, I still smoke weed so I guess I'm not actually sober, but that's truly it. I take it to sleep since I have insomnia and I refuse to let my doctor prescribe me sleep meds because I know how addictive my personality is. so now I have no idea how she knows.  I'm not angry at whoever snitched to my mom, I'm just truly disappointed ya know? Everything was handled so discreet. I know for a fact my dad said nothing to my mom because he promised me when hed help me get clean he would not mention what I'm going through or have been through to anyone unless I give him permission because as in his words ""it's not my place to speak on another mans buisness, especially when hes trying to better himself. 

I'm truly hurt by this because everything was fine less than 20 mom ago but now I dont know what's changed. I know I've been a major fuck up kn the past but people can change for the better right? I'm not trying to open a whole other can of sorms here but my sister stole literally $22,000 dollars from my parents and she suffered no repercussions, nor does she get excluded from things. I was caught smoking weed in 8th grade and went to prison for two years for having a single thc wax cartridge.  and for some reason people seem to think that's a capital sin that's going to lead you straight to prison like those old school advertisements.

My question to you wonderful people (I'm so sorry if that's not the proper pronoun you go by, I feel dead inside and my brain dosnt seem to want to work completely at 6:35am.

How should I approach this? I know its just Christmas dinner and its not a huge deal, but the fact that my mom called me and invited me and asked me to bring food makes me unsure how to feel.

Besides feeling heartbroken because my own mother dosnt want to spend less that 4 hours with me once a year hurts. It truly wants me to say fuck it and go grab a 20 sack and just forget how the devil walks around in a 5'2"" 220pbs white woman who loves to day ""bless your heart saeetie""

The best thing is about The text she sent me basically saying I'm not welcome in the house our family grew up in. What should I say to her? Should I leave it alone? Thsts what I've been doing so far.  I didn't wanna risk upsetting her since my dad is pretty positive shes bipolar or has some sort of personality diseass. 

My next question is should I ask advice from my aunts and uncles? I know most of yall will maybe say no because my aunt/uncle will just run to my mom and say ""look what your son said"" but my aunts and uncles arent like that. Yeah family is incredibly important to then but so is the truth in the matter. All 3 of them will not make a decision till they have heard all the facts from each side. And yes I know someone is gonna say but isnt there s little bit of bias since I'm trying to win my moms sisters into my side, I'd say yes there is just because they are related. My aunts are all incredibly intelligent women and I dont think they would have gotten to their current positions by sticking to and playing one side. But I dont know, even though with everything I said in the last paragraph I still think one of my aunts and maybe my uncle will show boas twords my mom.

I love my mother dont get me wrong reddit, she has her flaws but shes been there for me when I need her.  Granted it wasn't as often as she needed to he which caused me a lot of problems when I was in middle school and highschool. But who doesn't have faults? If my writing gives you the idea I hate my mom please realize it's the opposite. Our relationship wasnt healthy fir quite a few years but now that I'm getting older our relationship is improving at a vast rate.

Do you guys/gals have any suggestions on if I should respond to her text or if I should just let it be and see if she is willing to make the first move? As I've said this crushes me inside and breaks my heart and all I want to do is be able to spend time with her because i was in jail from 18-20 and i desperately want to get those years back with my mom since she refused to visit me, which I dont blame her. I knke how hard it was to see my dad behind a few inches of glass so I can only imagine how badly it woulda hurt her. I've been feeling great since I got sober but this is starting to drag me back down that deep dark hole again and I dont know what to do. I have trouble talking about my feelings in person. If I'm talking to someone on the internet or basically not face to face I have no issue I guess because it gives me a lil more time to plan out what I'm going to say.  If anybody feels like shooting me a message and just talking about anything, I'd greatly appreciate it. We can talk about the weather, or if folding pizza is the right or wrong way to eat pizza, or we can continue the eternal debate of of Magnus did nothing wrong (gosh darn it erebus)

Or so you think I should give her space? Let me know what you think. My mom dosnt seem to love me the way i love her but i dont know if i should keep trying or if i should give up.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. If my story is out of order or there are spelling mistakes. I'm so sorry, my anxiety from everything that's happened tonight has kept me from being able to fall asleep so I'm sure there are spelling mistakes somewhere in this essay I wrote lol.

I've bad to cut off all my friends from childhood because they are all addicts now and I feel like since I did that all I can do Is sit at home and do nothing since i refuse to be around people who could put me in that situation where I'm tempted. So like i said, if your ever bored and need one extra person for a game of xbox or ps4 let me know! I'd love to join ya even if yall are strangers haha.

Thank you all from the bottom of my heart! If you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll answer them as best I can. I'd like to try snd fix this problem not lie to myself and act like everything is fine.  If there are any sections that are confusing or dont make sense definately let me know! My depression has been causing my insomnia to come back full force so I've been unable to sleep. Thank you all for reading!

Edit: edited a few spelling mistakes and runnon sentences.  Added a paragraph or two also"
2000,Today might be the day.,"I may actually kill myself...I can't get sleep anymore, i don't care about school, i feel alone despite having a loving boyfriend, i have no friends, i don't care anymore....i just want to be free of my stress and past...."
2001,im just a faillure,"im so tired of all of this,,,im a loser,,im bad at everything,,,im ugly, fat, i dont even have any talent,,,i tried my best to be at least a good student but i failed,,,no matter how hard i study i end up not getting good grades,,,im just useless"
2002,A bit about me recently,"I just lost my job a few days ago because I’ve had to have time off work because they screwed up my back by not giving me any health and safety training and giving me constant heavy lifting for long shifts.


Because of this I’m on £300 a month, £200 of which I have to give to my mum. I hate getting money from the government, I want to work and I wanted to stay working in my previous job but I just couldn’t do it for any longer no matter how hard I tried.

I can’t drive yet but I have a car my dad gave me. It’s not road insured and the only place for it to stay is on my girlfriends family drive, now her dad doesn’t want it to stay there for longer so I’m going to have to sell the car which I will only get about £900 for.

I feel like my girlfriend is about to break up with me all the time and we’ve been together for almost 14 months but lately I’ve just not felt very loved and it’s making me really depressed more than anything else I’m mentioning here.

My family is more broken than ever.

My only sibling that I live with never speaks or comes out of his room. My mum is having to provide for us all with hardly enough money to do so. My dad (split with my mum years ago) is about to get divorced with my step mum.

I’m constantly paranoid and self-loathing and have no motivation or energy left in me. I’m not suicidal but I feel like the slightest thing could make me suicidal.

I just constantly feel worthless and don’t know what to do anymore"
2003,Holidays are miserable,its just me. alone. in a room by myself. doing literally anything to give myself pleasure. but nothing works.
2004,Does anyone else get really disturbing urges to be attacked?,"I’m not suicidal right now, not super depressed either as I am on antidepressants but I still get these ”urges” to want to be hurt badly. I’m a 19 year old girl, and even though the chances of me getting attacked in my small town are very slim, they are still higher than they would be for a male. If I’m walking home from a friends house late at night I secretly wish someone would come out of the bushes to stab me and run off. I don’t want to be raped or sexually harasaed in other ways, but I’d like to be beaten up badly or stabbed so I end up in the hospital. I think this stems from wanting attention and someone to look after me and care for me. I never talk about my mental health problems and I’m not one to victimize myself, but something in me just wants people to have a valid reason to feel sorry for me. Am I batshit crazy or does anyone else feel this way?"
2005,I'm done with school,"Studying all the time, working hard only not to be recognised by anyone. I've been dealing with a rough break-up that left my heart to pieces and i havê no ideia how i've kept it together this past months. Somehow managed to improve all my grades and the only thing people told me was ""Why weren't they higher?"" ""You should have done better"".
Even though i couldnt count on my family, i knew that i had some friends who would always support me. Or so i though. Going to school is a nightmare, an effort i have to make só as not to just fade in the walls or listen to music all the time. Those same ""friends"" just keep getting further away from me and any attempt from me to talk to them only shows me how much of a nuisence and idiot i am. 
I've come to the point where i simply don't trust anyone and i feel lonely no matter where i am. 
I'm so lost...."
2006,Does anyone else look through their old texts?,"I keep doing it and seeing when things were good and I was looking forward to the future, when I had good friends and stuff going on. I wish I could just go back in time"
2007,im tired of everything,"being alive sucks,,,it really sucks"
2008,If anyone wants to talk I’m here,"Not a creep, but i am a cripple. That being said I have too much time on my hands well hand, and if anyone just wants to talk about ANYTHING please feel free to reply to this for contact indo."
2009,Does anyone else romanticize suicide?,"So I’ve been a bit suicidal for some time now, but over these past few months my view towards it all has started to change, like in my mind it’s no longer a sad thing and I have moments where I’m even excited about it, I constantly catch myself fantasizing and daydreaming about crazy ways I’m going to do it, like hanging myself on an upside down cross, or painting messages on my walls as I bleed out. I’ve resorted to cutting because it kind of satisfies those thoughts and seems to be the only thing to get them to go away for a time but it’s not a permanent solution, anyone have similar thoughts and/or suggestions?"
2010,I love all of you,You’re all fighting. You’re here reading this and that’s proof of that. Try to take care yourselves today. I love you.
2011,"My depression has somehow disappeared this month, within the last week I have got my GED, and I have 3 interviews this week. One in an hour!","I can't explain it really, I was very much considering suicide, hurting miserably...probably one of the worst episodes I've ever had... then all of a sudden something in me sort of 'clicked' into place and it was like my depression is gone. I'm not fickle enough to believe that it's gone for good, but I have this new drive and motivation that I honestly have never experienced before. I still have my anxiety, among other things, but it's really like the depression is gone. I cried because I was so happy and relieved to feel, how can I word it...free? 

I'll be 20 soon, and I still don't have my license. Got my GED last week and I'm finally ready to start my life. Going into a phone interview at a sales company 35K+commissions in an hour. I'm super nervous. I've had a job before but my mental health got in the way and I had to quit and drop out of school. SO happy and excited to finally have some sort of meaning in my life, even if this doesn't work out, I am going to keep trying. Wish me luck!"
2012,"Writing a letter to my dad, is it worded right?","I am writing a letter to my dad to open up about how I feel, I've lost most of my support by pushing them away

anyways here it is

&amp;#x200B;

 I just want to start this letter by saying sorry. I feel that in person it's hard for me to come to words to express how I feel. I want to make sure I say everything exactly how it is, I don’t want anyone to take it the wrong way. I can tell everyone is starting to see through. I know I probably come off as lazy, moody, selfish, and just overall not happy. It’s something I’m still trying to fully figure out. Sometimes with the constant pressure of school, I feel like I'm trapped. Sleep is the only “worry free” escape I have. This has caused me to push away my main support system of close friends and family. It leaves me feeling lonely in a room full of people I love. One thing I know hurts me is you being gone. Sometimes someone just being there is enough support in itself. The house changes, and it feels empty without you. In no way am I telling you to quit your job, I know it makes you happy. In fact it’s been awhile since you’ve had a job that you’ve enjoyed this much. As much as I’ve lost my sense of overall happiness the last thing I want is for you to not be happy. There are only so many years left I have to spend in this house before I’m an adult, and sometimes what the future does or doesn’t hold makes me sad. I miss you when you leave, and I hope with time it gets easier. Love you always, Sarah 

&amp;#x200B;

sorry if this isnt the place for this, and im sorry i know there are tons of other people who dont even have dads and have it worse."
2013,Made another account for this.,"I'm in Year 9 in Britain (8th grade America) and I'm a girl. 

Please take a couple of minutes to read this? It would mean so much to me If just one person could read this.

About a week ago I finally had the medical appointment at cahms in the UK (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) and I was talking to some guy about everything, and he asked me about if I ever felt suicidal - there was a huge silence and I stupidly went even farther than talking about my thoughts and told him that &gt;!I had the rope ready, !&lt;which has coincidentally disappeared from it's hiding place, I managed to keep one of my sharpener blades though. He invites my Mum back in and asks her if she thinks there are any triggers to my self-harm, and I wish I was lying when I say the first thing she said in answer to that was ""she hurt herself because I took her phone away"" and I immediately try to explain about distractions, and how when It's the middle of the night and there's nothing to distract myself from all the pain with, It's either cut yourself or go that one step further. And the doctor tried to explain to her that it's not that simple. But here we were last night with my Mum taking my phone at 8:30 pm sharp, because she knows best and she ""can't sleep knowing I'm on my phone"" but apparently can sleep when I'm cutting my arm to pieces.

Also. telling me to ""try not to focus on my emotions"" is a very helpful thing to say, seeing as I don't feel anything anymore. You might have known that Maybe if when I tried to explain my suicidal thoughts to you you hadn't told me I was ""Just using it as an excuse, to get what I want and to blackmail"".

I got diagnosed and prescribed 10mg of some medication that I've forgotten the name of, cause my Mum won't even let me hold the box or get my own tablet out, cause I'll *probably* try to down all of them.  The worst part of all was the second he said the words ""It is clear to me you have clinical depression, and I think it's severe."" and my vision went white, and I swear my heart stopped. Too bad it started."
2014,Nothing matters,"I just want to end it all,I'm a monster,why am I still alive?"
2015,Do I need friends? Do I WANT them??,"Hello all

So I’ve recently just gotten out of an almost two year depression period, pretty great! Now I don’t feel like much and I have no friends.

So anyway, I’m really fucking bad at communicating. It’s probably because I’m so negative and when people talk to me about their problems my response is unsolicited advice, which my girlfriend has told me is rude and probably isn’t the response they want but I’m just trying to help! I don’t feel like it’s right to sit there and be like “oh that’s so horrible...” and then move on...

My girlfriend also said that talk to people very badly too... honestly I believe her even if I don’t mean to. I’m bad at replying over messages and I’m very condescending but honestly for me, being condescending is an improvement because I’ve never had any emotional control and I’m trying my best to learn it! I think I haven’t been around people for so long that I’m afraid they’ll reject me so I either leave first or I push them away because I know it’s easier to not help myself than it is to try to. Yikes, am I right?

I used to be so angry about the world and now I’m just negative and I express it to everyone I talk to, like, I constantly go on rants about the things that I’m bothered about instead of “being in the moment”. I’m also hella materialistic but I’ve never had much and I feel like I always need to prove something to people but I know that looking good on the outside won’t change the awful, depressing girl on the inside.

Realistically, I know that nobody cares about what bothers me (I promise I’m not moping about it it’s just a fact and I see it too) but knowing that makes things harder. I don’t know how to act differently and to get over the things that initially bother me in that moment. I’ve been told I think I’m better than other people and that I act like it too... but I don’t! Maybe I do? Maybe it could be a defence mechanism? I honestly think everyone is better than me...

Does anybody have a similar issue? I don’t want to feel like this forever but it’s been so long, I don’t even know if I have the emotional availability to be friends with somebody at this point but I am SO lonely and I have been for years. Advice is also welcome."
2016,Anyone else lose sense of humor,I always just cover my mouth and act like I'm laughing.
2017,Medication,My doctor wrote me effexor (venlafaxine) and reading all about the side and withdrawal effects people has suffered from....makes me really hella scared to take it. What do you guys think?
2018,Always betrayed by those close to me.,"It's a long ride, but here goes, I just need a place to rant and work through some baggage.  
Trigger warning: Depression/anxiety/suicide/sex

I've struggled with depression from the age of 11, I should have been more fucked up than I am, a girl with daddy issues.  I have fragmented memories of sexual abuse, parents who made me feel worthless, and eventually my first girlfriend betrayed me.

It was junior high,we kept our relationship a secret, little did I know she was also dating another girl in our friend group at the same time. Even went as far to have us both over at the same time on multiple occasions.  We both confided in each other that we were dating the same girl.  Well, I was the one not good enough, so she continued dating the other girl then later in our adult life, became best friends with my friend. Ugh.

I attempted suicide after this.  My step parents were awful they called me fat, annoying. Looking back I wasn't really that fat but I wasn't skinny either.  They would buy food for their kids and make me feel bad if I ate any. Like, do you really need to have a slice of birthday  cake.  This led me to hoard non perishable food in case I got hungry and didn't want to deal with their judgy eyes. Did they really need to treat me like this?  I grabbed every pill I could find and took them. I did not realize how sick I was going to get.  I puked and puked til there was nothing left.  I don't remember much other than the puking and taping out asking my friend to take me to the Er. When I came home after a stay at the stabilization unit. I told them it was because of my ex gf, I didn't want things to be harder for me. 

I eventually met my now husband in high school.  We grew together but also ensured shit together.  How naive to think that watching porn was cheating, I was so insecure, I only found out when my credit card was charged

Then it was the emails and dating sites. Each incident ending in a fight, where yes, he did mess up, but I needed to be stronger emotionally. At this point I had not been on any medication. He could not cope thinking it was his fault I wasn't happy. 

He eventually had to work up north a week at a time. When he came back he would be home while I worked because not everyone can work a week at a time.  We got into one of our rare fights where I told him he needed to stay and he threw me to the ground and left.

Fast forward to five years ago. We have been through all this through 10 years, want sure we would ever get married at this point. But we continued on.

His birthday came around and we had a threesome with a friend and he took it too far and came in her.  I wondered how stupid he could be that it took us years to get to that point that he does this with her?  I would think he could at least finish with me.
I left and cried.  I wanted to die, but I let this happen. We ended up breaking up. I was so depressed I lost my sense of taste. I spent Christmas alone. When we were on the mend I found that my ex best friend was hanging around him.  I thought okay she has a boyfriend and i moved the town over that it was unfair of me to try and deny him comfort.  One night he told me he would call me when he got home but I never received a call. It had been snowing and I feared he had been involved in an accident. I called and called with no answer. Later that week I found that this friend of mine had slept over that night and she was telling him not to go back to me.

He says it was when he got too drunk he couldn't sleep and then fixed the curtain rod that she started seeing him as a better partner than her current bf, which she did end up leaving in the end.  She knew he was handy, dad material, good job, sweet, ect. And started flirting with him soon after he fixed the curtains.

I was devastated. While I had worried about him, he was banging my ex friend. Why did I let this keep happening. Why did I want to go back to him.
Did he help develop this anxiety.

It seemed the moment i let my guard down, my heart took another hit.

It wasn't until I accidentally came across an email where he wanted to pay for sex. It never went further than that one email. I've had it. I told him he needed help and he was going to therapy or I was done.

Therapy taught him how to cope. And we were happy. We finally got married, we even have a healthy baby together. Things are good. My life is so whole now. 

I was blind sided when I heard this girls name at dinner. My SIL mentioned their wedding and how unique it was and I started crying.  I couldnt help it.  My eyes welled up at the dinner table while all those feelings came and slapped me in the face. While I'm living my best life.  After a childhood of dreaming of a family dinner, I'm now eating that dinner with my family and I'm sitting there stifling back my tears because I had let my guard down. I feel so much trust for my now family that I was reminded it is too good to be true, right?

My husband realized I had not properly dealt with this and offered to talk. I was so angry at the person he was before therapy but I feel so u justified to be angry because it is all in the past.

I'm hurt, I'm scared, and I want to be stronger because I also have a new baby that needs me to be at my best. He's been really understanding of my feelings as he's going through an illness of his own and he is starting to realize how much I really care for him and he promises I won't have to go through any of that again.  

I doubt anyone has cared to read this far but I need an outlet.
I hope I'm not a fool in this."
2019,Yeah my attempt to not suicide today - But I don't think i'll succeed HELP ME PLEASE,"I have been suicidal for a while now, it comes and goes. Although the first time I tried was back in 2012, I swallowed shitload of medicines, paracetamols, 2 fist full of them, but I was fine in 2 days, long story short I have had a very rough year, ranging from insecurities, being bullied, harassed, picked on and have had my family turn against me, heck I've even had my heart shattered into a million pieces..by that I literally mean shattered. Still recovering though, all these events that folded made me insecure and made it hard for me to trust any one, some days I feel like I can trust my best friend the most and some days I feel like I can't. Imagine trusting someone so much and having stomped on..the effect lasts long. I have had argument with another of my friend who was a really good friend..he became a jerk when I told him I couldn't lend him the money when he asked me for it.. He used to be so fucking nice..and I can't even imagine he would accuse me of being a ""motherfucker"". After all the times we've helped each other out. I have written 2 suicidal notes on my laptop throughout the past few weeks, no one knows about it - just me. I won't go into the details about just how all the events folded this year, but know that I am normally a very soft and caring person, I blame myself for being born this way, I absolutely loathe myself, I've failed in 2 businesses I started. Heck I didn't even manage to graduate my high school and the regret lingers on, it sometimes makes me wonder if my girlfriend sees me as a failure too? Because my parents sure do. Of course I am not here for any sympathy from any one. I am simply not worth it. Of course people feel sad sometimes, but they have people to talk to, and they can. I can't I physically can't, I  feel lonely and I go into solitude just because I don't want to hurt anyone with my ill mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had this gush of feeling that sent me spiraling down this lane. It's not one of ""those"" days where I feel like I'm ok and the next moment I feel suicidal. Those days are still controllable but today if different, I feel so much rage especially with everything that's going on around the world. There is no sign of humanity and love left. Know this that I am not that person who takes suicide lightly, so know this I am not fucking OK. The insecurity from past months still lingers on, the bullying from my past still lingers on, some days quiet, some days intense. I don't want to hurt my girl , she is the best anyone could ever have. I don't want to hurt my parents, they are the best anyone could ever have, but I am fucking suicidal right now, I have cried so much today that I'm feeling numb to the pain. I feel so much hurt that it makes me tremble.. I feel like a mess explaining myself on the internet.. I guess its my last resort to not hurt the people I love the most. I feel like nobody takes me seriously ever, I feel that no one cares enough and I am tired of trying to be OK, I am just tired. I am heading to the beach once again... Please don't tell me to be thankful for life. I didn't ask for it, I want to be unborn right this instant because no one wants to understand me.. I was told that we will get through this together no matter how long it takes but I don't think that is in effect anymore.. I have been and am a victim of depression but i try to cope with it. People don't realize that for people like me it only takes one word to give that ""nudge"" towards killing oneself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway if you read it till here thank you so much for your time.. I wish I wasn't feeling like this and I wish I wasn't suicidal.  I wish I was better for you all."
2020,Pls read this and help me,"I seriously need help. I always have problems maintaining relationships. Everyone in my life comes and goes (including family). I've had such a harsh life since young.

My parents split at the age of 3 and my sister and I suffered living with my mum. My mother would rage over small things and shout or sometimes beat us violently. She eventually calmed down when I was 6

Besides her, I would suffer physical and emotional abuse from my maid at the age of 6 to 12. She would pinch my eyebrows whenever I try to sleep and she would shout at me over small things (like if I wanted to watch tv she would yell at me to go to my room). This cycle would literally occur every day. I remembered crying in my room literally every day. There was this one time I woke up at 8 am and decided to make myself breakfast. While pouring milk into my cup, she went hysterical and screamed behind me, yelling at me to go back to my room. I stood my ground and shouted at her. That's when her eye got so big; you could see the anger on her face. She ran to get a knife and slowly turned around and started waving the knife at me. I remembered running back to my room, crying for what felt like hours. 

I was also bullied badly in school while this maid drama was going on. There were these twins who joined my school in grade 4. They absolutely destroyed my life. They took all my friends away from me. They made sure everyone hated me for no reason. We were friends for a while but just when I told some secret that my mum smoked, they made sure to tell every fricking one, even my mum. Omg I can still feel the betrayal and fear I had when I was 10.  It was so hard in school since I had no one; I was lonely when I was in school and at home. I remembered coming back from school, crying myself to sleep every single day.

It was so hard for me. Being bullied in school and coming back from more abuse from my maid. Till today, I still have anxiety attacks when I see the twins anywhere or when someone brings up about my maid.

So at 13, I have had transferred to a different school. I thought my life would be better since my maid had left for good and I wouldn't have to see the fucking twins in my school ever again. But things got worse for me. People in school would give me an attitude because my skin colour was different from the majority of my school. My ""friends"" would backstab me and go outings without me. And over 2 years, I'm all alone. again. It really seems like I can't maintain any friendship I have ever encountered. Pls try and help me."
2021,How can u self-diagnose depression?,"I’ve been depressed lately, couldn’t sleep properly and always carry around this dark cloud over my head. I feel like I’m a terrible person and negatively impact everyone around me. If I had the choice, I would choose to die or never be born into this world, I’d die right now if promised there would be no pain. I used to be known as the unnecessarily positive girl until a couple months ago. I don’t know what’s happening to me I’m just so negative and sad most of the times and I don’t know how to deal with all these emotions."
2022,I can't trust anyone anymore,"Okay so I'm 14 and I have depression but everyone yells at me for my depression. I can't trust anyone and I need someone. I feel like God put me on this earth to suffer. Oh by the way I have autism and everyone makes fun of me for trying to get my words out. And everyone says I need to get over my depression.

Please help me

I wanna die"
2023,What’s a dropout (17M) to Singapore?,"I’ve spent 5 years in secondary school, constantly failing. I made it through in Sec 1, dropped to normal stream in Sec 2, wormed through Sec 3 and failed Sec 4. I repeated the year, but I’m not sure I can get through again.

There is a way out should I fail: private school. But it’s hella expensive. I feel ashamed that my mother spent so much money on me and got nothing in return.

I had a fight with my father about a week ago. Nasty shit. Blows were traded, vulgarities screamed, my grandmother pushed over. My phone, computer and tablet were taken away.

Today I won my phone back in a game of table tennis. Would take a couple more wins to win back my computer and tablet. But when I asked my dad whether he’ll take them away if I fail, he just said I won’t want to know.

Now I don’t spend time online usefully. Just mess around Reddit, listen to songs, write stupid fanfiction and delete them because they’re stupid, you know. But I have to use them. I can’t live my life.

When I’m on the net, I don’t feel like a failure, an idiot about to flunk secondary school. I’m an activist in the dirty world of politics. I’m the God of my little stories, birthing, raising up and killing my little characters.

It’s pathetic, but I can’t live the life of the beaten down school flunky I am. I live the lives of my regular Reddit account, my YouTube account, my writing account.

But I can’t do that any longer.

I’m lost. I’m scared. I can’t sleep at night. I can’t do anything but wait for my results to come back and crush me.

So someone, speak to me."
2024,i don't want fucking help,"yeah i know people try to be good and all, but help is not on my mind right now. wanting to get better is for those who still have that hope in their lives. but that's now nonexistent in mine, it's gone. i dont give a fuck if i die to today, tomorrow, or 30 years from now. it's all the same futile shit to me, fuck"
2025,Im Lonely,Its great to have friends and family. But my friend's never check up on me. They only talk to me if they want something or if they need someone to talk to cause their other friends aren't there. Wanna know what's worst? The only things my family talk about is my grades. They hold this weight against me because im the oldest on both sides. I have 7 siblings. It sucks ill be a disappointment to everyone who has tried their hardest to keep me on track. But ill always be a c student. Maybe i should get friends that support me. But i cant because everyone downgrades me and says that no one likes me. This is why i walk with my head down. I refuse to meet the eyes of people. This is why im anti-social in the first place. Their are people dying because they go through shit like that. No one considers how i fucking feel. So ill continue to be alone. No relationships. No friends. No communication with family.
2026,Is anyone else just scared,"It's hard to explain but I'm going to do my best. 

I feel like I constantly want to apologise to the people around me for just being around me. 

I feel scared at the idea of making connections with people, I think the idea of just opening myself up scares the shit out of me. 

My life has gotten to the point where I want to be alone but with people. I want to be invited to places and liked by people but I don't want to talk or be engaged cause I just feel like I don't know how. 

How did my life get here and how do I turn it around?"
2027,I just want everything to stop. - 拒絶,"#sorry for my bad english.
I’m not looking for love, just acceptance. That I exist. The last thing i need is rejection. I lost count of how many times I got rejected. Small things, but they keep piling up, eating through my insides slowly. I keep trying always putting on a smile but it never mattered. 
I just want everything to stop."
2028,Anyone else have this feeling?,"I've been wrestling with a singular idea in my head these last few months, and no one else I know can relate, so I'm shouting into the void of reddit and hoping someone hears me. 

It's not that I want to *die*, per se. I just want to *cease*. 

If I could just be wiped out of existence with no trace, that'd be ideal. The main thing that stops me from ending it all is the fact that everyone that has even a *slight* emotional connection to me will be impacted by my death in some way.  I'll be as much of a burden in death as I was in life, and I don't want that. 

I want to be *erased*. To be never born, never grow up, never die. That's what I want.

Anyone share my sentiment? Or, if not, any ideas on how to deal with this outlook?"
2029,I tried reaching out but I was turned away,"*WARNING THIS IS REALLY LONG SORRY, I JUST NEEDED TO GET THIS OFF MY CHEST AND I HAVE NOBODY TO TURN TO*

Hi, I’m posting this about a day after I lost all my friends because I’m too much for anyone to want to be around me. 

For context, I overthink EVERYTHING. My best friend/almost boyfriend had a friend over this weekend, so naturally a number of nights out and days out happened. I know this friend quite well, I thought, so I was looking forward to seeing him again and catching up. Tbh, I was looking forward to catching up with everyone because I’ve been the biggest recluse for the past few months. 

So, I’m talking to my best friend on Friday,saying about how much I’m looking forward to going out with everyone on the night. He doesn’t give me a straight answer on what’s happening, so I wait. And I wait. And it gets later and later and l don’t hear anything from anyone. I get upset because I start overthinking- have they gone out without me? What did I do wrong? Do they not like me? I don’t drink much because I get sick easily, is that why they didn’t invite me?

Eventually, after a night of panic and crying, I go to sleep. In the morning I message my best friend again, asking what happened. He still hadn’t replied to my last message. Eventually, at around 4pm, I get a short reply of ‘me and my friend just went to pub for a bit, you live far away so it wasn’t worth you coming’. At first I think ‘ok, that’s fair enough’ because it does take me around an hour to get to where he lives (same city just bad public transport). So I ask how his night was, he says it was ok, and I move on. I’d planned a big night out on Saturday with everyone, so I was looking forward to that. 

So, I’m sat at home all day (my family we’re away across the country). Part of me expected a ‘want to come for food?’ or something, since his friend was only here for a few days. I didn’t get anything, so at around 5pm I ask my best friend what’s happening about the night out, what time we’re going etc. I get a reply saying everyone is out at the minute, and have been all day, so he doesn’t know what time they’ll be going. I read the message and get really upset, because why wasn’t I invited? Did he really not want me around? We were meant to be together, but he’d gone out of his way to avoid me this weekend. I overthink everything again and come to the (maybe logical) conclusion that they all hate me and have been laughing behind my back. I get openly angry at him, just wanting a proper reason why he’d been avoiding me when just 2 days ago he’d been saying how much he liked me.

Eventually, I calm down- there was no point spoiling the night I’d planned and been looking forward to for so long. I message later that night asking about timings again, and arrange a meeting place etc. I start getting ready and packing my bag (because I was staying at my best friends house). Then I get a message from my best friend saying he doesn’t know if he wanted me to go. I ring him, asking why. He says he doesn’t think it would be a fun night with me there, because I’m upset and he doesn’t want to deal with it. At this point I’ll clarify we’re basically together, so I was a bit taken aback by him saying this. It was a complete turn from the original plan, when he sounded happy to have me there. So obviously I start overthinking, cry all my makeup off, get really really sad and start just feeling suicidal. I really couldn’t get my head round my best friend, my boyfriend, not wanting me at a night out ID planned. I message him saying how upset I am, and he rings me saying he’ll come round to my house to make sure I’m okay/don’t do anything stupid. I say alright, but say he doesn’t have to because I know he wants to go out. At this point I kind of expect something, but the replies stop. I start to feel worse and worse, like spiralling. I message him asking what his plan is, whether he’s still coming because I didn’t feel safe on my own. No reply. 
I sit awake all night crying, wondering why my best friends care more about a night out than making sure I’m ok. My best friend knows how bad I can get, but still he didn’t seem to care. I end up ringing my mum for help, but she couldn’t do anything because she was away. Eventually I go to sleep, I wake up in the morning at around 5am feeling just as awful as I did before. I check my phone hoping for a reply of any kind- nothing. I check Instagram, only to see a story from one of the people that went. It’s a big video captioned ‘best mates’. Low and behold, there’s my best friend, drunk, having the time of his life. It dawns on me that none of them really cared, not even him. I message him again saying I’d seen the video, and that I didn’t want to see any of them again. At this point I had it in my mind that this video was posted purposely to make me upset (it probably wasn’t but idk that’s how my mind works). I’m hysterical, crying for hours and hours until my parents come home and then I just cry at them some more. I explain the weekend and they assure me that my best friend has been out of order. 

So Sunday continues and I’m crying for a good portion of the day. I can see he’s online, just ignoring my messages. Eventually I get a message from another friend asking if I’m ok, and if I want to go out for food to take my mind off everything because he’d been telling everyone what I was like at the club the night before. I reluctantly agree and go. At first I start to cheer up, finally feeling a bit of relief from the awful weekend. Until my friend tells me that, no, it wasn’t a few pints at the pub on Friday. It was a full blown night out, and everybody went. Everyone but me, who was ignored all night when I’d made it so obvious how much I wanted to go. So obvious. Now I just feel like I’ve been played, like he could’ve lied about so many things. Did he get off with someone? I wouldn’t know, he’d lied about going out. 

as the day goes on I decide to bite the bullet and meet up with him, hoping to get things sorted so I didn’t feel awful anymore. I needed to work on Monday, so I had to feel somewhat capable of getting out of bed. So I ring him, because he was still ignoring my messages. He answers, and agrees to meet up so we can talk. We agree to meet in the station here, since it  as late and quite empty. About 5 minutes after I ended the phone call, he arrives. But not just him. Everyone. The same crew that went out on friday, all day Saturday, Saturday night... all of them were there to spectate and see how upset and mental I was. I felt sick. I was so angry he’d brought an audience of my friends to watch me have a breakdown, especially when he knows how anxious I get. 

So I kick off at him, saying I’m not talking to him while they’re around. He’s reluctant but agrees to move away from them so they can’t hear us talk. Then we proceed to be there for about 4 hours, talking and talking. He refused to accept he’d done anything wrong, no matter how I explained how bad it made me feel. He said he was right to prioritise the night out over me, because he ‘thought I was ok’ and ‘knew I wouldn’t do anything stupid’. The thing is, I really did consider it on Saturday night. What if I had? I was so upset by his blatant dismissal of how I felt, I just didn’t know what to say. I questioned him  on Friday, asking why he didn’t invite me and why he so blatantly lied. He first denied lying, until eventually he said he didn’t want me to go because I ruin the night all the time and he feels like he has to take me home etc when I’m upset. I’m just confused, because I’d drop everything to make sure he was ok. I’d go home from a night out to make sure he didn’t kill himself, so why wouldn’t he do the same for me?

Eventually it gets to the relationship stuff, and he tells me he can’t be with me anymore. Why? Because he doesn’t want to deal with my depression. He doesn’t want to have to talk to me when I’m depressed. He doesn’t want to be there for me. Although I’d do anything for him, he won’t for me. He tells me that nobody would want to deal with me. Nobody would ever want to be with me because I get depressed. He says he still wants to be friends, but he doesn’t want to hear from me when I’m depressed anymore. This is the person I confided in the most, dropping me because I’m too depressed. 

Weirdly we left on forced good terms, he took me home to make sure I was ok then left. Obviously as soon as he left I felt so empty. So horrible. I cried all night, because nobody actually cares. Even the people that say they do, don’t. I have a massive panic attack, end up messaging him for any kind of help because nobody else is awake, and he replies ‘can’t talk now I’m watching a film’ then ignores me.

I haven’t gone to work today, I can’t do anything. I don’t know what to do, when all the people I consider my friends think I’m too mental to want to have anything to do with me. This has happened before, with every friend I’ve ever had. I’m just unlikable, unlovable and destined to eventually end my miserable existence. Nobody would even realise I was gone."

2036,"I thought that I was getting better, I was wrong","A few months back I started my medication and went to therapy. Someone convinced me to do it and pushed me forward. 

For a while, I was alright. Things were finally starting to look up for me. I was starting to see a future that I wouldn't be spending alone.

Yesterday, I lost that someone. I loved her, she was the one to get me out of the hell I've spent my life in. Now I'm back at the bottom.

Life is cruel, I want to go back to cutting, alcohol and every other thing that would end my life just a bit faster.

The time I spent with her made me realize what life actually feels like. I might have hit the bottom again but I want to feel that same feeling again.

I want to live, not just survive. In order to achieve that, I have to keep going.

Life hasn't heard the last of me yet."
2037,"Having aspergers and being ignored in school when suffering from depression,can anybody relate?","I am an 18 year old teenage boy who was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome from a very young age.

Throughout my life I have always had learning difficulties for example learning to not use capital letters in every sentence and even difficulties with math in school from a young age.

Luckily though I finished most elementary school subjects except for math which I never got any higher than an F but I catched up on it in high school.

This is where the subject of this thread starts because I started in a remote private boarding school specifically made for people with things like autism or ADHD.

It was during my first 4 months there I suffered from a depression that may or may not have been caused by me leaving elementary school and starting in high school.

The worst part about this though was that to my parents I acted like everything was fine and in school I was tired all the time from sleep deprivation caused by the depression.

Here is where it baffles me because none of the teachers who had lessons with me even remotely acted like they acknowledged that I had a depression and they acted like everything was fine.

Eventually I tried hanging myself in the bathroom at home by using a shirt hanging on the towel hanger tied to my throat.

After several failed attempts I gave up although once I could actually feel pains in my head but I am not sure if it meant it was working.

I only got out of it by telling my mom I was depressed and not feeling alright and suddenly it was as if a heavy cloud had just been lifted from my head or a prisoner breaking free from his chains.

And yet here I am now 2 years later going strong and getting good grades with a bright future ahead of me.

Can anybody relate to this or is it just me?"

2039,Being ugly is not fair!!!!,"That's all... People look you weird, weirdo! I can do the same joke someone beauty does and people won't even smile to me. And yeah, of course, the worst part, girls will never like me. Since I was 5~6 (I'm 26 now), I remember people from school yelling at me, making jokes, because I'm too ugly, and I know, I really am.

&amp;nbsp;

It is not fair, life, God, or whatever mystic force guides us. You know, right? When you go to a party, every friend find a girl, but you, haha, you're disgusting, girls don't even look at you. Once again, thank you, God, for this!

I promise myself: Next year I'll not make a post like this, because I will not be here anymore, I hope so!"
2040,I am only alive so I don’t ruin my kids lives.,"This has been the worst year of my entire life. My 33rd birthday is on Christmas, and I wish so badly I didn’t have to wake up that day. I want to go to sleep forever, but I don’t want to break my kids. 

Dying is all I think about. The last 24 hours have been filled with obsessing how I would do it. I spent 2 of those hours looking up a therapist in my area. I wish I could take a week away from being a mom, so I could check myself into a hospital and just be alone. And I know that wouldn’t make me feel any better, but I need a fucking break. 

I’m so reclusive and alone right now. We moved back in with my parents in October, and I’ve been working and trying to save money ever since to move out because my mom is a toxic asshole, but I feel stuck. 

I have consistently wanted to die for years, and the only reason I haven’t is because of them. Because if I die, that means my parents have to take over, and my mom will ruin them just like she ruined me. I fucking hate myself. I’m so fucking lonely, and I’m scared because these thoughts are getting worse, and it’s getting harder to hide them. 

I don’t want to reach out to anyone, because I don’t want to bother them with my shit. But I need help. I’m not going to survive this without help."

2043,I had a hell of a rough week and when this happens i always dream with an old crush.,"Short story: My father is an alcoholic and me and my mother kicked him of the house for a day and told him that he could come after he went to the doctor, he agreed and came back home. I'm proud of him going to the doctor but the ammount of anxiety he gave us on those days was some of the worst days of my life. Also he went to talk to his mother and sister. His sister has some mental problems and came to our house almost kicking our door down and threat us. I won't blame my father, he was drunk and drunk people don't know what tthey are doing but he told us he will talk to his sister because she has no rights to do what she did.

&amp;#x200B;

Dream part: This isn't the first or the second time it happened. I always dream about my old crush when i had 15 years old which doesn't make sense to me because i'm 25 now and had more girls i liked after that. I have to say now that at 15 years old i was deeply in love with this girl. I have cried so many times after she went to the other side of the country.  Here is the dream. i was playing pool in a competition, i lost my first game and went outside to get some air and guess who was there to watch the games as well? My old crush. I talked to her and told her that i am sorry for always telling her i loved her everyday. She said that that it is in the past and its ok. I told her that i don't like her in that way anymore and i just want to be friends but what i felt for you before i never felt it again. You know when someone walks in the room and your day just got suddendly better? That's what i felt i would look at your eyes and see the paradise. Your soft and soothing voice would calm me down and make me happy. Then she leaned and kissed me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then a truck went into reverse in my street, started to ""BEEP BEEP BEEP"" and woke me up. I feel depressed asf, almost drop a tear and i'm either with a cold or flu.

&amp;#x200B;

How does my brain process this and make me dream with the girl i had loved the most? It's not like she is a safe place because i got rejected. I don't feel anything for her anymore in my day by day."

2048,I'm done with life,"I feel so demotivated to do anything. I mean nothing bad is happening to me right now, I dont cry as much. I just feel ""blank"", however I still regularly think about suicide. I don't know if it's getting worse or getting better. I've had some bad stuff happening to me in the past - bullying, heartbreak (?) etc. Which I'm pretty sure is kinda normal for people around my age to experience 

But I just can't handle it, I don't have the will to fight back, I just let it happen and hide my feelings to not seem weaker than I already am, people say I have a lot more issues than depression like anorexia, anxiety etc. Which just makes me more depressed-
I feel weaker, I feel like I just want to stay in my bed the whole day and do nothing - I can't even do some of my hobbies since my friends keep making me play some other game that I don't have interest in anymore. 

I always feel like I'm the problem of somebody, if I'm going with a relative to a party as an example, I'm going to feel like everyone doesn't want me there, if I go to a public place, I'm going to feel like I'm ruining everyone's fun. I wish I didn't mess up a ton of relationships with people because of how bad of a human I am. 

That's the blank feeling I'm having, I've cried so much, been lying in bed too much. I've just felt these emotions way to much that I'm used to it and it feels blank, now don't get me wrong. It still does hurt, just so much that it doesn't. 

(Sorry if the post is all over the place. It's currently 3am and I can't sleep)"
2049,I don't want to tell my friend that im seriously considering suicide as a last resort,"My current friend group I'm in right now has been the best one I've ever been in, but I've never felt safe enough to tell them in detail my dark and depressing thoughts. There's no reason to me not feeling safe enough to tell them what I'm actually feeling, I've never fully expressed my actual inner thoughts to the full extent that they reach. I made a private snap story with the people I trust the most on it so I can actually get these thoughts out, just very toned down obviously. It has helped a bit, getting something out is much better than keeping it all inside and never telling anyone how you feel. The people I have on it respond to it often and are very supportive and always tell me how much they love me and all that stuff. And I'm very thankful for that, don't get me wrong, but I kinda feel awful that im not truly expressing how bad shit is getting. For instance, for the past few days I've been seriously considering suicide if I get put back in high school classes. I go to a highschool program on a college campus, so you have to basically prove yourself worthy that you can take the actual college classes that they let you take after you've proven yourself. This semester I pretty badly failed my Calc 1 class, and for a lot of cases when people fail a college class, they get sent back to highschool classes for a semester, and those classes are actual hell trust me, I'd rather take another calc class. I had been going for a Math &amp; science degree until this point, and early on in the semester I realized I absolutely hated what I was doing, and that just turned my mental health to absolute shit. Whatever I did, I just couldn't get motivated to pass the class, and I could never find a reason to do good in the class, I never even went to the final. And with all that explained I can get back on topic sry lol. I'm really really fucking scared that I'm gonna get put back into highschool classes, I haven't been told if I'm gonna be sent back yet or not, but it fucking terrifies me that I might get sent back. Being sent back to those classes for a semester would put me at my absolute lowest point I guarantee it. I've been seriously considering suicide if I do get sent back, because I don't think I could handle 15 weeks of those anymore, my mental health was bad enough when I was first taking them to prove that I could take college classes. The other class I took this semester went great for me, it's a great example that I can pass college classes with good grades. I haven't told anyone about these worries, or that im seriously considering bad shit if it does go as wrong as my mind tells me it is, I'm scared to tell them because i think it's going to hurt them, which is the worst fucking feeling. unintentionally hurting people with your own hurt is the worst fucking feeling in the world. They say I can tell them anything, but I seriously doubt they want to hear that im seriously considering suicide as a last resort. idk what's gonna happen at this point, so wish me luck peeps. sry for getting hella off topic every 3 words, this is more of a rant if anything"
2050,I’m losing it. I don’t know what to do.,"I’ve been skipping my meds and I refuse to take them. I’m scared of the future and what’s to come. I don’t know why this is happening to me but I’m afraid I might do something to myself. My friends all left me this week because I’m moving, they just ditched me like nothing, they didn’t even follow me when I sent them my social media. They’re just gone. So I’m friendless and worry some. I’ve tried to reach out to mediums and tarot readers but it doesn’t work, the answers are all different. My anxiety and depression are so bad right now. I just want to know the future, I have no idea what’s wrong with me."
2051,Why am I so mentally fucked up?,"I have a pretty normal life. I had a pretty perfect childhood, I have loving parents, I have very few, but good friends. I know you can’t help having depression because of chemical imbalances in your brain, but I have awful thoughts. I have rape/abuse fantasies, I think about self harm, when I’m driving I think how nice it’d be to drive off a cliff, I look in the mirror and I’m disgusted by what I see but cannot control, I think about drugs and getting shitfaced, I think about disappearing, I think about destroying my life, I tell myself my boyfriend doesn’t actually want to be with me, I dissociate a lot. The list goes on. Nothing about my mental health is healthy, but I can’t seem to figure out why I have SO many issues. Anyone else feel this way?"

I don't know if talking can help me."
2055,Why this is happening,"Last night when I went to the bed early because  I was feeling pretty bad, my head was hurting a lot, I started getting insona about 3 months now but only this month I have been waking up between 1 and 2 times per night every day, last night wasn't different but when I wake up in the morning, I was feeling happy I don't know why but I could smile I thought I will be able to enjoy my day, but why I keep thinking about suicide. It was good when it lasted now I feel like shit again."
2056,The point?,"“What is the point of it?” A question I always come back to. Sometimes I wish I disappeared. I have this mental loop where I think about how every interaction I have and every action I take is absolutely pointless, my entire existence will come and go. And at some point in time a person will have the last thought of me ever. Then poof, I vanish into nothing as if I didn’t exist in the first place. So is it really a big deal if I vanished now? The pain my absence would bring would be temporary, but the pain my existence brings will last my whole lifetime. How can I just escape this nightmare and stop being so sick? I occupy my time with the gym, which I’ve been recently inconsistent with. And trying to find some sort of love while also looking for what I’ll have as a profession. But my 18 year old self is quickly becoming less excited about my future and I’m beginning to feel very unmotivated. I’m not sure what to do. Please have me in your prayers, whoever reads this."
2057,I need some advice,"What is the best way to get rid of scars? I have them on my leg and I am so self conscious due to them, I cant wear a bikini or swim suit if I go on holiday, I cant wear dresses or skirts in case they get seen, I cant wear shorts, does anyone have any tips on how to make them fade?"
2058,"I had made plans to kill myself at the beginning of January. As the date moves closer, it's like every emotion that I've bottled up for the past several years is coming to the surface.","My girlfriend and I broke up in 2015 after being together for the better part of four years, and I never cried or mourned her. But lately I've been imagining what it would have been like if her suicide attempt while we were together had been successful, or how I would have felt if she had died somehow. I'm literally bawling my eyes out over a fictional death, and I think it's because I never allowed myself to grieve over the fact that we split. 

I've been crying from shame about porn I've watched and horrific jokes that I've  told years ago. 

I cry for all of the horrible deaths I callously watched on r/watchpeopledie before it was banned. I try to make up for that by holding their deaths and lives in my memory, and making sure that they're not forgotten. 

I just responded to someone else in r/suicidebereavement about my grandmother, who I never said goodbye to even though I knew she was dying and she had tried to contact me, and I'm feeling guilty about that. 

I've been crying that I don't feel close to or even know if I believe in God anymore, and how I wish I hadn't been raised in a such a fire-and-brimstone church that made me fear and hate Her rather than love Her (my therapist suggested that I should think of God as a female due to my daddy issues and problems with my gender identity). 

And of course I cry over what my suicide would do to my family, even though I have a lot of unspoken resentments toward them and I don't really understand *why* they would miss me. I just desperately want relief from the mental illness that has absolutely haunted me my entire life, that no drug (prescription or otherwise) seems to be able to mend.

I'm deeply sad nowadays. I feel like a sociopath that's experiencing emotion for the first time in a long time. In some ways it's a gift, but in others it's a curse and I don't know how to bear it."
2059,Starving and bingeing,"For the last 6 months or so I have found that my mental health has really effected my eating habits. I feel like a go back and forth between not eating for a full day or binge eating junk food. When I don’t eat I get depressed then when I binge I get depressed. It’s really effected my weight and skin, this makes me feel ugly and fat, which just leads to more starving and bingeing. Any tips or strategies? 

Also I know I should try meal prepping but it’s so hard to have the energy to do so."
2060,Whats the point,"Thats it i finally have hit rock bottom

Nobody loves me 

Thats the coldest feeling

Im sorry"
2061,"I really must be horrible, i deserve this.","Nobody ever likes me, I've never had friends, I've never even hugged anyone.

I use to be happy alone, but comments from others, the absolute lack of anyone in my life giving a single fuck about me, and my growing realization that people just don't like me, eventually suppressing my emotions backfired.

I'm obviously pretty horrible, i just annoy people, and i deserve to now be depressed and lonely...

And now i made this thinking selfishly maybe someone will care...fucking pathetic 

I honestly just want to die already"
2062,A rabid animal,"I suffer from nihilistic depression, exsistential depression, anxiety, sexual and physical abuse..... I find no inherit joy in life, I have little to no purpose, I don't feel emotions at all I wear them like a mask. I smile but my eyes are dead. I'm more of a hollow shell and have been diagnosed with sociopathic tendencies. I don't feel emotions I wear them like masks and underneath is a constant state of fear, stress, and indifference. I find it easy to manipulate people into doing whatever I want and I can take advantage of them for personal gain but I don't act on them. 

I don't want to live but I could never kill myself, I've tried and failed on two occasions and my therapists don't give a shit as long as I don't kill myself because that's all they're paid to do they only care because I paid them to care. I don't know how to live alone because being alone with my thoughts drives me insane so I date women in order to fill a hole that will never be filled. The only way to end it all is to kill myself but I can't do it. I just can't......

Nobody gives a shit about you or your mental health because at the end of the day only you can fix your life and everybody else worries about their own. I don't want to be medicated, because I don't want to rely on an artificial drug to make me seem happy. You can take all the pills in the world but it will never solve your problems or fix your broken soul. Your life doesn't matter, nobody is born for a purpose, and everything will be destroyed when the universe collapses in on itself destroying everything you and whatever else humanity has achieved or ever built. You're life and the entirely of the human races is nothing but a blink in time compared to the endless universe. 


I just take it one day at a time as cliche as it sounds but its true. I wake up everyday wanting to die in the hopes I'll get killed by an accident or whatever but I still keep going. And it's truly a living hell I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.....  I have more money than I could ever want and yet I'm still never happy. 

Idk man, I knew life was never easy but I'm only 24 and if this is how my life is gonna be like then idk how long things will go. I'm terrified that when I get older I'll lose my mental state on the idea of suicide and do it and that idea alone will terrify me and haunts me. 

I don't need people to fix my problems because there isn't anything they can do. My mind is a rabid animal and the only thing that keeps me afloat is a sliver of hope but even that fades from time to time and I truly am not happy nor do I ever feel happy. Even on good days my happiness I know is a mask that I can easily switch off......

*Sigh* so yeah, that's my problems and forever will be them."
2063,Appetite,"Hey guys. I have been struggling with my lack of appetite and I'm losing weight like crazy. Even after exercising, I just can't seem to eat more than a few bites of anything. Not even my favorite foods, nothing. Eating with this lump in my stomach seems impossible. Do any of you have any tips on how I can improve that, other than exercising and eating foods that seem appealing?"
2064,I don't like the weekends,"At work I'm distracted. There is someone next to me to talk to. I have a task. A goal. 

On the weekends I feel a pressure to be social and if I'm not due to not having friends or my family is busy, I feel like garbage.

I feel alone. I don't have a goal. I don't hav someone to text readily iwth random thoughts.

I did but it feels like she doesn't want to be my friend anymore for some reason. 

There is a void in me now. My therapist can't find me friends. My coworkers are only friends to a certain extent.

I'm so sad."
2065,Advice for dealing with a depressed friend? (Tw:selfharm),"How is the best way to help a depressed friend? One -if not- my closest friends has been suffering from depression... I belive. Shes never gone to a Dr 

Ive always try to cheer her up, encourage her to go out and hang out etc ( she works and according to her she has no friends. At all.
She has worked for a year and doesnt talk to any of her co workers) so shes not home alone with her thoughts, bur lately i just feel like
im at my limit? And it sounds awful 

But everything i say she turns into something sad and dark is kinda brings me down too , for ex:

‘im looking for a gift for secret santa, what do you think i should get?’ ,She says ‘idk ive never received a gift in my life’

I said ‘oh tomorrow is my niece bday and we are gonna get some cake’, she replies ‘cool, nobody cares about my bday ever’

Like everything she finds a way to twist it , Ive try to not get hurt or lose my temper but idk how to deal w it? I have my fair share of problems to deal with
 
Shes often on Twitter saying like she hates Instagram/Facebook bc all she sees is people having fun and shes a loser , stuff like that

She always calls herself fat and ugly, Ive told her come to the gym w me and well have fun together and then finds excuses to not go anywhere 

Ive recommended her multiple times to go to a therapist and get professional help, Ive gone to therapy my entiere life for eating disorders, childhood traumas and self harm and i feel she would feel much better if she gets professional help and a diagnosis no? But she refuses to go.

A couple weeks ago I hit a low and self harmed and I told her I did it and that i was feeling off , she was quite shocked that she didn’t knew I self harmed since high school , although Im fairly sure ive told her before ... days went by and then i told her like oh my arm is better im ok now and she was like ‘oh why? what happened to your arm? And it really hurted me since im there everytime shes down and i try to help and she doesnt even pay me the same level of attention or support when i need it?


I really love her and want to see her get better and I dont wanna ice her out of my life. We used to text every day but lately I just stop replying after she makes a comment that makes me
Uncomfortable and just let it be for a couple days. But i feel like im reaching my limit , idk what to do and I get scared she might hurt herself or also her negativity to bring me down and make me Self harm as well 

What do y’all think i should do?"
2066,Miserable PS4 players - What are your favorite games?,"Christmas is coming and I would like to hide from my life in games, which is the only thing that helps anymore,  so I was wondering what games depressed fucks like me like to play"
2067,Triggered by movie,"This weekend my friends came over and i was in a bad place. I decided we could watch a movie. (so i can distract myself)

We found a movie in the comedy genre. I don't remember what it was about exactly but it started with a depressed dude who wants to kill himself. I don't want to kill myself but everything else was exactly how i felt and it triggered me when my friends laughed about it. It felt like they were laughing at MY life without them even knowing it. I know it's a comedy but i couldn't laugh about it since it was prettt much the story of my life, played by someone else.

At this point we were only 10 min in but i couldn't take it anymore and said ""this is a way too dark movie right now and i don't even think it's funny. Let's try another movie""

A little back and forth but we searched for another movie. This one i did like. It was overall a really lighthearted movie but at one point the main characters say:
""let's play a drinking game"" 
""what about a cutting game?"" 
(this shit was not funny, added nothing to the rest of the movie and kinda mocks self harm to be some kind of ""fun"" after school activity)

At this point my heart sinks in my chest for a moment because i had self harmed that same morning. Other than that remark, it didn't trigger me at all and i laughed my ass off.

The thing i'm wondering... Has there always been this much reference of cutting/suicide in movies (even when it adds nothing to the plot) and i just only now start to realize it? Or was i simply unlucky with my selection that day?

Also when i'm watching alone in my room, suicide/depression/self harm in movies doesn't phase me at all. Maybe because i can cry if i have to. Maybe because i don't want my friends to see i'm dead inside? 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I would love to hear it."
2068,"i'm just an attention seeker, i guess","i try to open myself up to people and all they do is tell me i'm looking for attention and that if i was depressed and suicidal i would have killed myself ages ago.

and you fucking cunts wonder why i'm so closed and private when it comes to my depression. when i finally die you'll be like ""oh wow, i didn't know, aw that's sad, i guess""

i feel like i'm the villain, like i'm the only reason to be sad. ""cheer up"", alright, fucking help me cheer up then. like you'll ever miss me. only thing i ever do is make people sad, angry, annoyed and generally bring the whole class down. hope you have fun spitting on my grave, if my family can afford it.

pretty ironic isn't it? that i'm using this post to get attention (kind of)."
2069,I hate myself on a large scale,"I can't seem to do whatever I plan on doing to improve myself. I make distinct choices, but, my inner desires seem to always preside. I took a 5 hour energy today and experienced way too much erratic movement to focus on the exam that I was studying for at 1 in the fucking morning because I had never studied for the class in my entire life and btw that exam is later today at 10 am. I'm the cause of all of my failures. I want to change my behavior--I say this all the time. And it just seems that I always fall into the same pattern. The key concept here is that there is no ""it gets better"" there's only ""a temporary time of content that which will pass by the never-ending pain and sorrow of being an inconsistent bastard"" I'm late to honestly everything. Instead of complaining about my shit I know that I need to get up off my ass and do the work to ensure I don't end up in a pattern like this again, however, I continually wobble between being alright and being holistically saddened by any discrepancy that interrupts the new path I had been trying to forge to betterment. I critic myself way too much. I obsess about the right way to do things. The right way to eat, exercise, socialize, flirt, joke, work, learn, teach, write, etc. (the previous sentence was in the order of my most consistent thoughts about myself these days). I hate the way I look. Whatever I do to feel alright is never enough. I'm told by several people in my life that the way I think and deal with the things that plague me is unhealthy. I stress myself to sadness. It starts off small then grows and grows until the belittling I instill upon myself has reached an entirely new level as I realize any terrible thing I, or others, have had to say about myself is true. I am the person I try so hard to not be. The entire month of November I spent smoking and drinking, hanging out with friends, staying up past 2 am, barely putting effort into school, and avoiding working through the self-esteem issues I was having. My self-esteem has reached a new low!! I haven't felt this worthless in the longest time. I feel so inept--it's funny, really. I mean, I'm pathetic. I'm really fucking stupid in the sense that I can't get myself to do the simplest of tasks. December has been fucking rough. why the fuck do I keep typing in short sentences. I have so much trouble taking care of myself. It's that I don't care. I remind myself that I should care and the fact that I'm not caring for my body further pushes me into the depths of my despair. fuck why is this edgy. this is so stupid. I can't bring myself to open up to a partner because I'm so scared that what I share or whatever relationship we hold means little to nothing to this other person. I know I'm not lonely because whatever I'm feeling isn't a loneliness, I've felt that before. I feel anxious at multiple times of my day. I make as many connections with people as I can, but I don't share so much my personal issues because I don't think they need the burden. I have a frantic need for socialization as it distracts me from my responsibilities. The thing is, I want to be vulnerable with people so bad. I want to be able to feel unwavering trust for another person so bad. But, I can't help feeling that everything someone tells me is a lie. I truly feel crazy. I can't trust my fucking self to stick to my obligations and to decipher the truth in the words of another person. No one really cares for me. All anyone wants is someone to complain to. I don't like complaining as it makes me realize how stupid my complaints really are.  I'm literally so dumb. I'm a fucking idiot. Can we just take note of that fact that the entire time I wrote this lengthy shit that I'm sure no one will read because of how long it is, I was supposed to be studying for my final. ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. I also laugh as an automated response to discomfort, stress, and pain. This much is true. I think. Idk if I used that right bruh im so dumb I need to study. this was so erratic holy shit my bad aahahahahahahahahhaha im sorry if this doesn't belong in depression but I've been in tears for about 80% of the last 2 weeks because I'm really shit. It just seems no matter whatever good thing happens, something that reminds me of my pain occurs and I'm back in a dark place."
2070,i in that point of my life where i will just beg someone to love me,"idk what is wrong with me but i want to feel loved like really loved.i don't just want someone to use me for the body i have.nobody has ever loved me and now i don't know what to do....i'm not happy with myself nor my life i just want to end my life



P.S. sorry if this is the wrong subreddit"
2071,"i suffer in silence and im really good at it, i dont even know how to reach out anymore","My boyfriend isnt the touchy feely type, but i need affection so much. 
were living together now and ive come across an internal issue of needing affection because it makes me feel better when im really down, but not bugging him about it. so i just sit there or lay down trying to calm down but in the end i really do just end up messing myself up even more 
i try telling him but i never talk to get it started because i dont want to come across as needy, but i really do need some sort of affection on a regular basis or i just get so down and i start telling myself that im really not worth anything to anyone 
i dont know how to handle myself 
i really do just want to end it so i dont bug anyone with my needs 
nothings really keeping me going and its because i dont talk about it 
but at this point what even IS the point if i cant talk about it"
2072,I dont know why," I feel so sad. Like this cloud is following me. I have so much to be happy and grateful for. These past two weeks should have been the super great. But I just mindfucked myself, and cried."
2073,what do you think dead is?,"I'm always thinking about dead and how dead must feel, and its a really deep thing to me."
2074,"My psychiatrist suggested I take my anti depressants after breakfast at 10 AM everyday, I was wondering if I could switch it to after lunch 2 PM, is that alright?",
2075,He was right,"I am going to die alone. My ex was right. I have no friends and no future. This didn’t come from out of nowhere, just that he finally admitted to what I’d been upset about while being with him. Not being able to provide him the happiness and drive he’d been looking for. He had said that he was delusional about me and being with me. That hurt a lot even though I had been saying that while we were together. The confirmation of that was devastating to hear even if I knew it was the truth.

No one calls to check up on me, I don’t have any texts and I haven’t been able to work properly for too long. Being successful and seeing the fruits of my labor aren’t meant for me. I have no purpose here. And I don’t see the point of success if you’re just going to be alone. If I’m going to be so upset all the time then I wish i had the ability to express that but I still don’t even have that particular strength and probably never will. I won’t be getting a memoir from someone I love. There isn’t a story to tell."
2076,"Today, I finally lost the will to live","I feel like I've been fighting a losing battle with myself. For the past few months, I've been slipping further and further down a depressive spiral. Everytime I feel like I've hit rock bottom, life keeps deeping straight down. I've lost motivation and interest in almost everything that I used to love doing like learning guitar or riding a bike or finishing all the video games and TV shows I told myself I would finish. I've been eating poorly and my sleep schedule is all over the place. My grades have been dropping. I've started from not drinking a drop of alcohol to becoming wasted every week this school semester. I can't talk to my family about myself freely since they spent the majority of my life constantly pushing me to be better than what I'm capable of and ignoring my emotions. I've come to the realization that the majority of my friends are superficial and unhealthy to be around. The few remaining friends I could potentially open myself up to are dealing with their own battles and having another issue to worry about could make them feel even worse. Everyone I know is talking about things they want to do over the winter break but I haven't been personally invited to anything for months and I'm tired of hitting up people to have some form of social interaction. My crush has flaked out on me multiple times to do her own thing and even cuddled someone in front of me yet I'm still in love with her for whatever reason and I hate myself for so. I don't know what to do about myself anymore. Everytime I try to pick myself up, I always end up somehow worse off than before. I finally hit that breaking point where nothing is worth doing and I can't do this anymore. I just want to sleep until better times come."
2077,How to deal with depression and isolation?,"My depression has caused me to want to isolate myself a lot- mainly to prevent myself from hurting others or myself. I’ve become very bitter and angry and extremely sad and incapable of hiding it at this point. Sometimes I will say offensive things to my family and when I’m with friends, they unintentionally make me feel worse by how great their lives are going (they’re successful, pretty, and get to travel to beautiful places). This all has caused me to want to isolate myself even more, but this only makes me more depressed too. It’s just bad either way."
2078,I don’t know where I’m going.,"I’ve kept this in for a long time. I don’t have a consistent person in my life, and I’ve lost all of my trust, so i don’t have a person to talk to. I’ve realized it’s okay to be alone, but the mind is such a dangerous place and it honestly gets the better of me, that’s why I’m posting this.

I’m 19. I’ve been dealing with depression / mental illness since I was 11, on a regular basis. I love smoking, to ease everything, drink occasionally. when it’s all gone and I’m all by myself, I find myself feeling lost again.

Over a year ago, my parents divorced. I’m happy that they stayed together until I was older, but things changed a lot. my dad moved, got married again. my mom lost it, got ill and got a drug addiction. she eventually moved away with her boyfriend. I live with my brother now.

August 14th of this year, my girlfriend of 3 and a half years left me. my depression played a factor. I’ll admit, the last month of it I was lacking. I was just so confused, because I 100% thought I found my soulmate. that was my best friend, literally my only friend, in my mind. I was devastated. It hurt the most when she said something along the lines of “we’re so different, did you really think we were going to work out?” I planned my life out with this person. My trust in people really fell all the way. my lover, best friend switched on me like that. now it’s 4 months later, no communication ever since she came to get her stuff and I can’t help to feel like a failure as a boyfriend and as a person. the thought of it just makes me sick...

That’s just the surface of recent things. and I’m still here.. trying to love like I’ve never been hurt before and I pray every night for progress. I guess I just miss it, what we had. I will always think fondly of you, even if you gave up in the end.
I will always have a place in my heart for you, even if it’s not the same back. But I wish you would leave my mind, like you already left me.

I guess the lesson is never get too comfortable. all of these nights crying, I just feel like a fool. I’ve lost so much, but still manage to be thankful for what I do have. It just hurts, I have nobody I can trust and truly talk to.."
2079,When I finally thought I could be happy...,"The whole class starts rehating me again for no apparent reason. My family, teachers and everyone says it might be my fault, ""I can't just say it's eveyone else's fault"", so it's me.

How? Why? Why is it so hard to not be hated?? What do I need to do to make everyone neutral to me again? Is it because of my face? Am I ugly? Do I not talk? Am I aggressive? Am I mean?

I'm out of this shit! Seriously! This is demotivating me on so many levels!!!! I can't even study anymore. I'm so fucking destroyed.

Fuck everything."
2080,I feel so lonely.,"Attending class is painful, I am surrounded by people talking and enjoying each other company and i am completely alone, dreading for the lesson to start just to have one less thing to think about.."
2081,My life is pathetic,"I’m just so sick of it at this point. I wish I could just end it and be at peace. The problem is I feel guilty about even trying because of my family background. I just want out though. I’m 27 is this all there is to my life? 
I just want to be at peace why is that so hard for people to accept? I have nothing that I want to live for anymore. So why the heck am I still here?"
2082,Been trying to beat for a long time . Need help,"Hey everyone , I’ve dealt with depression before when I was a teen and it was a really tough time and ever since I’ve been in a battle with depression . I do try to not fall into but I’m so sad and ashamed to say that I am once again deep into my depression . I feel ashamed bc i let it beat me . I have no one to talk to about it . I miss my family and I feel alone even though I’m not . Which makes me hate myself even more I try day and night to keep thinking positive and smiling and making myself get out of bed but I feel horrible I feel like I lost myself . I hate every little thing about me and my life and I’m so tired of hearing that “I’m in the place I’m in because I don’t try “ I try everyday !!!! I get jealous of the people that seem to be stronger then I and move on . I can’t concentrate at work . I feel scared all the time anxious and like the world is out to get me . I feel I can’t do anything right"
2083,I have it better than so many people.,"My life is so much better than so many people; I’m not a starving Syrian child on the frontlines with a Kalashnikov in my hands, a directionless squatter in - a Romanian apartment block, or an evacuee suffering the latent effects of the Chernobyl disaster. Everything’s somewhat stable in my life; I don’t have the right to feel sad or be depressed. How can I deserve to feel sad if so many have it worse than me? I feel like an ungrateful piece of garbage for being depressed. I hate myself for this - for everything. Fuck me."
2085,"Tackling so many different health problems at a late age is causing me depression, what activity can be done to provide some temporary escape and happiness?",
2086,"Tackling so many different health problems at a late age causing me depression, what activity can be done to provide some temporary happiness?",
2087,What’s going on?,"Hi guys.
I’ve been suffering a deep depression for the last 9 months, but it doesn’t seem to be like actual depression. Unsure. Basically, the part that I seem to focus on the most is that I don’t dislike myself or think I deserve anything bad, I’m just super sad and upset all the time. Thoughts on what else I could look into that’s causing this other than typical depression?"
2088,I feel useless to the point of wanting to self harm,"I m trying but I can’t. I try to do my work for the family business. But I can’t. It’s...so frustrating. Like a wall that I can’t brute force my way through. 
U don’t like the family business as I was practically forced into it with my brother in a position of power over me. He is bad, very bad.
I can’t do what I have to. I want to end myself. I want to beat myself again, but I know I shouldn’t. It’s like a storm inside. 
Help...help...my meds seem to not really help.
This morning I got a call from my mum, who has nothing to do with the business, asking if I m not doing anything for this shitty fucking business. I tried to explain, but how can I. She said it isn’t much to do. How to tell that amount of stuff doesn’t matter. What shall I do? Help."
2090,Unhelpful doctors,"I have seen quite a few doctors for my severe depression and anxiety, they gave me all kind of meds, but at the end, I feel like I am bothering them and they tell me stuff like « meds don’t do it all, it has to come from you ». No shit? The only reason I get out of my house is to see my doctor once every month. I have been analyzing myself, my emotions, my anxiety, my triggers, my relationship with myself and with the world, I have analyzed my childhood, because my depression is deeply linked to it... But I have 0 clue what to do. I keep convincing myself everyday that going better is the only solution. The problem is no one really knows the « recipe » to get out of depression. All you can find are questions, and you have to find the answers yourself, and I just have no idea. I feel abandoned and helpless."
2091,"i've watched my life fall apart in front of my eyes, and it's all my fault.","i'm not quite sure how to properly phrase my thoughts because it all just kind of hit me at once, so sorry if i seem like i'm rambling.

everything i've done - every person i've talked to, every assignment i've finished, every test i've taken, every game i've played - it's all been for nothing.

i know as a college student that i should be living life and going out and doing dumb shit and planning for my future, but i just can't bring myself to that mentality.

ever since i was a kid i used to be the smartest one, the ""prodigy"" meant to create a cure for cancer or become the man to extend the lifespan of the human race. but that's all sort of fallen apart in the last 8 or so years.

i don't exactly know when it started but at some point i stopped being able to keep up, even though i started doing everything i could to do so. i can't remember how many days i wasted, how many people that asked me to hang out or go see a movie or get dinner or something, how many of those people i denied just to put my all into what i thought i was destined for.

i gave up everything else for just a shot at what i wanted. and i might have just given up my last hope.

having to restart with a couple handicaps wasn't a big deal but still giving it your all and not being enough is something that i don't want to accept, especially after how i used to be.

in middle school, i was a straight a student, part of model un, made it to the state spelling bee, competed in chess tournaments and even took down some of the best in my area. and i did it all without batting an eye. quite literally a prodigy. i had a dream - to become the best at whatever i set out to do - pretty ambitious yea, but i was 12 give me a break. what i really wanted was to get into the university that - if i made it through - would set me up for life in the best possible way. i'd make my parents happy, i'd be happy, i'd have my friends by my side, and everything would be great. but that vision started to fade on march 21st 2014. that fateful day in eighth grade where my life started to crumble in front of my eyes.

about 4 months prior, i'd submitted applications to a magnet high school and an ib (international baccalaureate) high school - those that would give me the best chances of getting into my dream university. but on the day that decisions came out, i watched all of my friends get into the school they wanted, while all i saw were rejections. at the time, i figured it was a minor setback, i'd still go to my local high school and crush it there and make it in the end, boy i couldn't have been more wrong.

in high school i watched myself get my first c's ever, and at that point i thought it was over. sophomore year i fell from rank 1 down to rank 151. at the time, i figured if everything else went well, i'd be okay, that i'd still be in the top 10 in the ranks of my class, and everything would work out in the end. but in those 3 years i watched myself tear apart friendships and give up everything i used to care about for school. i thought to myself, it would all pay off in the end, my hard work and determination would let me win.

senior year, up to that point i had taken 12 ap classes, while still taking 6 more that year. it was the toughest and most mentally consuming year i'd ever been through, and at the end of it, i came out at rank 8 out of 650 people, with just 2 c's on my report card and the rest a's. along with this i was a part of multiple honors societies, ran varsity cross country for 2 years, running on the team for 3 years total, and taking some of the hardest classes my school had to offer. and at the end of it, i watched history repeat itself, and went through the same grief i experienced 4 years ago in middle school. i watched all my friends get into their dream schools, while i got into just one of the 17 schools that i applied to. 

this was just under 7 months ago at this point, and i had given up everything for this, and yet, my efforts were in vain. i stopped trying for anything, losing my drive and my will to better myself and become sufficient with what i had. i watched as my parents started arguing with me a lot more, telling me that it was my fault, that i could have done better, and me wondering how i could've done better than my best efforts. i've stopped trying in almost every aspect of life. all my friends that i had in high school and middle school don't even know what school i go to, and i can't be bothered to let them know at this point. and everything i've worked up to and sacrificed has all been for nothing. i want to keep trying and say that even though the last 8 years didn't go my way, maybe something will change.

but i know nothing i do will change the outcome of my reality. so i've stopped trying - i've stopped trying to make friends, i've stopped trying to find interests, at this point i've stopped trying in school, now getting c's in classes that i breezed through in high school. i've stopped trying to better myself as a person, i've stopped trying in life, and the only thing i haven't stopped yet is living.

i've learned in the last 8 years that life isn't fair at all, and sometimes even your best efforts aren't enough. but if my best efforts aren't enough, then why bother?

i'll give myself and this life one more chance to let me win, after being beaten down for the last 8 years. i'll give myself until next november to try and find a reason to change and become better. because if nothing's gonna change in the next 11 months, i don't expect anything to go better for me until i die.

sorry if i've sounded pretentious or arrogant that i should be able to breeze through life without lifting a finger - i don't mean to sound like that at all. i'm just tired if giving everything i got and getting fuck all in return.

there's a lot that i didn't cover here that i don't really care to unless you want to hear it for some reason. i guess i just need to find something to care about that doesn't make me feel like an utter failure.

tl;dr - i used to be good at everything but for some reason am no longer good at anything and i'm giving up.

thanks for reading this - please don't try to help me, i'm sure i'll figure something out sooner or later."
2092,Is this subreddit making depressive worse?,"Yesterday I had an discussion with my gf about this subreddit. I told her about it and that it feels ""good"" to know that there are other people out there who have a similar view and suffer from similar things. She asked me if the input of this subreddit doesn't make my depression worse. Which I denied. But after some hours of thinking about it, I am not that sure anymore.
What do you think?"
2093,Growing up SUCKS,"Today, in two hours exactly, I (F22) will be traveling with my boyfriend to another city since we're about to move in together. I can't stop feeling nostalgic, reading Harry Potter, kinda not getting it. I find myself with a job, going to college and talking about finances, going to the bank and many other awful/stupid places for my paperwork, but at the end of the day I'm just a little girl on her pink pajamas, reading this stupid novel and hopefully, waiting for the weekend to play videogames and eat sooo much icecream - without those romantic shitty movies - all night long, just to see how I fail in my attempt to lose weight the following week. 
All that shit to wake up the next Monday to go back to work, without any support from my parents since my mom passed away and I haven't seen my dad in years. I'm just lonely and I keep surviving while I see how the fuck I keep growing up. I just wanna go back to high school, I wanna smell the kitchen's air while my mom is cooking. I wanna fall in love again and not being trapped in this 6-yrs relationship with I guy I don't really love but it's ""good"" to me. 

I can't help but feeling depressed about it. Is this normal? I feel extremely overwhelmed, not happy at all. 

PS: sorry for my bad English, it's not my 1st language - clearly -"
2094,Honestly.... I’m just always sad.,I have zero motivation to do any thing let alone lose weight. And I’m letting stupid internet stuff get to me
2095,Male depression being a joke to people?,"How is everyone acting like you’d just need to speak up and they’d help you, but if you actually try they just think you’re weird and start avoiding you. As a guy they just want you to be masculine, tough and stuff.
I might actually put more energy in convincing people that I ain’t got problems so that I don’t have to bother them and they still treat me the same way.  
Anyone can relate?"
2096,i’m scared,"idk what to put here. so i guess i’ll be introducing myself first. hi, i’m 13 years old and i can’t do this anymore. i’ve been cutting since this january and every time i think i’m okay enough to stop, a night like this comes around. i’ve never cut enough to be hospitalized, just enough to draw blood and have a bright red scar for a week or two. 

my parents know, but honestly that makes it worse. in june, my best friends outed that i’m gay to my parents. they’re christian, and obviously they didn’t accept me. i’ll try to make the whole story short, but this happened less than 3 days after i turned 13. my parents took me down to their room to yell at me, i don’t want to repeat what they said, but after that, they sent me to talk with a pastor and a youth pastor. neither of them helped at all, i’m still gay. the youth pastor talked a lot about sex and made me really uncomfortable so i don’t see her anymore.

my parents found out that i cut in june too. my dad? he did what he usually does and just ignored it and went on with life. my mom did a lot worse though. she told me she should take me to a third world country so i could see what real suffering is. i don’t know if you guys know how bad it feels when your problems are made insignificant. 

i never cut too deep, i do it just enough to see lines of red smear my wrist. i want to be able to control some kind of pain, so i guess i turn to physical.

but i genuinely cant do this anymore. i think about suicide daily. but i won’t do it until my best friend dies. she’s an online best friend though and she lives on the other side of the world. she’s my entire life, she’s the only person that i know loves me for sure. i know that me dying would hurt her, and i couldn’t live with myself in this life or any afterlife knowing i hurt her.

i need to know if anyone out there is going through what i’m going through. i need help, but i can’t. i do online school, so i have all day alone with my thoughts.

so in summary, i’m a gay depressed 13 year old with unaccepting parents who has been outed to over 6 people by my 2 closest friends. i think about killing myself daily. give me some coping methods and something to be happy about"
2097,I have barely gone to school since grade 6,I dont know  if this is the right place to but is but Im 16 and I have barely gone to school since grade 6 and it making things herder every day all I do is stay in my room 80% of the time but I dont know why I cant go I want to go but i cant I have ADHD anxiety and depression but still i should be able to go to school i have no social life either and that does not help and im at my breaking point as/is any one going throw the same or some what the same.thing and how do you get through it
2098,Yesterday was my Birthday,"My Birthday is always one of the hardest and loneliest days of the year for me. My depression, anxiety and multiple chronic illnesses have caused me to push many of those who were close to me away. So I’ve lost a lot of friends through the years. I can understand why people don’t want a depressed friend who often cancels plans, but it’s always difficult to see how much love other people receive when it’s their Birthday."
2099,Over and over and over and over,"Its the 6th time this year that my mom has kicked me out of the house. She has something wrong with her but she refuses to get help. She goes overboard with everything and actively causes scenes that i have to clean up or keep her away from. This time it was no different and all of it because she didn't like the fact i spent the night a town over for a birthday party. Not only had i told her i was gonna be gone but that id be back before noon the next day because i had work later. I don't even go out often because i have no friends infact the only reason i went was because its an excuse to drink and because i got invited by one of the last people i still keep in touch with. 
But she just goes overboard the moment she saw me back today she started going off about the fact that i ""couldn't even finish a semester of college without breaking down about it like some faggot"" and shes not wrong i still hate myself everyday for dropping those classes but i dont need to hear it from anyone else i know i fucked up i hear it in my head every day. She was doing it to tell me to stop being lazy and to do something with my life when i AM, Im fucking trying i have two jobs to make up for the fact i screwed up my first semester of college . Im trying to make up for the fact she hurls insults at me whenever i do take my adhd medication and as a result i never ever have them not for months straight because as my mom likes to say ""only drug addicts NEED pills"" then goes off about people using adhd as an excuse despite she being the one who had me tested as a child. Its all so confusing and 100% why i avoid her like i do but im just so tired of this constant fighting. I always give in i don't care about being right or wrong i really don't i just want peace is that so much to ask for ? She yells at the top of her lungs and throws things at me i don't know how to calm her sometimes and alot of those times she will try to throw punches at me or do her favorite ,make me sleep at the neighbors because they're nice enough to let me stay when she loses it like right fucking now . im just so tired of it all i really wish i could buy a gun and get it over with but no im too much of a pussy to finally do something I want."
2100,Pregnancy would be my breaking point,"I’ve been through a lot, rape(2), sexual assault, emotional and physical abuse... but if I ended up pregnant, I don’t think I’d come back from that."
2101,"Opened up to group of friends, was told to fuck off afterwards in school.",No more opening up I guess.
2102,"Depressed, paranoid, intrusive thoughts","My mind isn't clear rn so this might not make sense but 

Over the last 2 years I've had this kind of slow psychosis (if it's appropriate to call it that) set in and it's not going away. 

Basically there's been a lot of tragedies in my life, pets dying because of the irresponsibility of others that I trusted them with, a lot of rejection, and my dad passing away (last month) 

And I feel like it's personal?? If that makes sense. Like something out there hates me, wants me dead and is guiding me towards unhappiness and suicide. Like a demon or something. I know that this is an irrational thought and is actually probably just a description of depression, but fuck. Why can't I catch a break? 

Also dealing with a lot of social paranoia, like, when I go to talk to friends it's like they all have excuses for why they can't talk (I've known some of these ppl for 5+ years.) But again, I know that's probably just me personalizing and having harmful thoughts toward myself... but still it makes me want to withdraw 

Idk haha. I'm a mess. I'm trying to get back into therapy though"
2103,depression anxiety overthinking idk what's wrong with me :/,"i just need someone anyone to help me, im 16 and about 2 years ago my mind and my life just went down the biggest hill ever. i got hit with something, i don't like to self diagnose but there is something seriously wrong with me... i wake up and i'm just sad.. one little thing that goes wrong just sends me spiraling and it can ruin my whole day, mainly because i let it ruin my day because i'm just so tired and so lazy that i don't feel like fixing it and i don't have the will to get better and it just sucks so much. i come home from school and take a 4 hour nap because my sleep schedule is all types of messed up but i don't FEEL like fixing it. i don't have any motivation to do absolutely anything anymore. i overthink like crazy. all my relationships have been screwed because of my anxiety or overthinking or whatever it is. i blow things so far out of proportion and my mind just creates so many random scenarios that don't even make sense but in my head they do and then i just accuse them of something so stupid and then i argue and argue with them and it just ruins our relationship. i just feel so empty and i have no emotion at all like it sucks so bad but someone close to me could die and i swear i wouldn't feel as sad as someone should feel. i just have such a careless attitude towards things. i never ever care about my future and i just care about things that happen in the moment and i'm a sucker for dopamine and having gratification in the moment and not thinking for the future and thinking about what might happen if i say/do something. i'm just in such a deep hole and i don't know what to do. i have yet to see a therapist but i've talked to people who say meds don't work, and i vent to people a lot so i don't see a need for a therapist. i'm just so sad all day long. NOTHING makes me happy, granted i could get a girlfriend or a pizza right now! those are happy things that we get happy about but for me i'll get happy but for about a minute or hour and then i'm just right back to being sad again:( i'm never truly happy and any happiness that i get its only temporary and it just sucks so much. my life is just awful. i have so many good things in my life and i can't seem to figure out how to be grateful for them. i also am addicted to nicotine which has no help towards my case but it's just so fucking hard to stop. my willpower to stop is just nonexistent and i feel that ill never be okay again

tl;dr my life fucking sucks"
2105,I think about dying every night,"I’m stressed. I’m currently a high school senior and I’ve been pressuring myself to be absolutely perfect academically. If anything disrupts that, I break down into shambles. If my depression or whatever this hell is breaks loose, I started biting my fingernails until they bleed or I can’t stop shaking in fear. When I get home, I let out all of the tears I held in for that day.

I also moved a countless number of times, almost every year. I’ve also had big issues with my parents because they seem to be always fighting about money or their jobs and my dad is constantly convinced that I hate him. I know somewhere deep inside him, he’s not particularly fond of me either."
2106,Can anyone answer me on what 'strong' means?,"I'm starting to get really annoyed with people saying, 'I'm not strong,' or 'I need to be strong.'

Seriously, what in the he$@ does that even mean?

I'm trying to make peace with those comments so that I don't get upset when I hear someone repeat them.  :D"
2107,How do you even get a girlfriend?,"I really hate the position I'm in. Some girls take interest in me, but then I ask them out and they friendzone me, say they don't have time, or literally any excuse to not be with me. I hate being alone."
2108,I fucking hate everyone and everything,You know when the depression and the feeling of being miserable has built up for so long that the suicidal ideations just hit you full force? I don’t know what else to say other than i’m fucking done and I know the day is soon now.
2109,Is being dumb and stubborn part of the disease?,"Dumb might not be the best word for it, but it seems like I simply don’t listen or understand what everyone else is saying. 

For example, I personally don’t have any valid reason to feel insecure about my appearance or work, everyone around me encourages me, they all say my work is great (I’m an artist), they all seem like they really care for me and love me, my so never ever judged my appearance, my parents always encouraged me, etc.

I’m constantly feeling unworthy of love, ugly, I’m desperate to change, like I’m not too girly so lately I’ve been buying makeup and jewelry but they obviously don’t fit on me. I’m 30F and if feels like I live in my own parallel reality."
2110,I really just need to ramble about the annoyances of depression/bipolar,"I have struggled with my mental health for over a decade and I NEVER open up about it because people immediately come back at me with reasons why I should be “happy”. People who haven’t suffered from a mental illness don’t realize that it’s literally an imbalance in your brain making you feel the way you do. You can do well in school, have a job, have a family, and still want to fucking die every single day. Don’t assume because someone is successful on the outside that they are not struggling and barely hanging on. I told a close friend that I was suicidal and they blew it off and told me to check my blood levels for a vitamin D deficiency..... OK guess I’ve been vitamin D deficient for 11 years—where the fuck are my rickets ??

I also fucking hate how it’s a trend now to “be depressed”. It belittles those of us who actually suffer. 


I don’t want to die necessarily. But it would be really rad if there were like a room of nothingness I could just sit in forever. I’m afraid dying would hurt. 


I’m just tired of this illness. I finally sought out help and am taking lithium. Convinced myself I was doing better until tonight. I guess that’s part of being bipolar. A week of feeling like I’m fucking high on life and I’m not “sick” then I crash and all I can think about is dying. 

This rollercoaster fucking sucks. But I am going to do what it takes to overcome this. 

Thank you for reading my ramblings."
2111,I’m just... feeling done,Idk why but every time I feel like things are going right something brings me back down to a point where I feel like life isn’t worth living any more.. I don’t know what to do anymore
2112,"At this point, I am too afraid to think positively of myself. It's too weird.","And by let's say, should I force myself to slowly start thinking positively I feel like I am setting up some expectations which I will most definitely at the end fail. Then I will feel even worse..."
2113,I got into shit at work today. I got ditched. I hurt my jaw. Fuck today.,"A couple weeks ago I was rushed off my feet and didn’t follow procedure for something  and I’ve been bitten in the butt for it.

And also, Now someone is filing a complaint against me.  I’ve got all the proof I need that I did nothing wrong but still. How fucking awful. I feel fucking awful. I feel guilty even though I’m in the right. Even my manager said I did everything right but this person is still complaining. The anxiety of it is awful.

Today has been an awful day. I’ve been ditched, fully in the cold and that shit burns like nothing else I’ve felt before. It hurts. 


And I cracked my fucking jaw and it hurts so fucking bad.

Everything is just impacting my emotions today. I just needed to vent it out.
Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
Still trying to stay positive."
2114,Please help me,"I'm not strong anymore.

It's not working, it not.

I can't

I'm so tired

It's just the same thing so many times

I hate my brain

errrrrrrrrrrrrr"
2115,Distractions = Reality Checks,"I’m curious as to what you guys think. Or if you have similar situations?

__feel free to ignore this is you simply want to share your stories/experiences. I’m all ears... or eyes in this case.__

I tend to distract myself with music or videos. Anything related to music or comedy. But I have this tendency to realize I’m enjoying myself then get this sudden shock of anxiety like I’ve distracted myself from reality too long that, it becomes too much. Somewhat of a existential crisis feeling. 

I won’t say, I don’t feel like me ,or that reality feels “unreal.” I’m very self aware that I exist. I’m just constantly depressed and constantly trying to find ways to distract myself as much as I can. And the more overwhelming my current situations get, the more I dig deep to the point I feel like early death is an inevitable conclusion."
2116,"quarterlife crisis, just want to chat"," going through my so called quarterlife crisis, thinking a lot about my past, what i could have done better, how i could be better, and the lot.

its been a rough life, 26, have a good job but im not happy. i cant remember the last time i was. my friends have all moved away, my boyfriend and i are growing apart, im picking up a nasty habit, and reverting back to old tendencies that hurt me in the past. just could use a friend, chat is easiest."
2117,I'm done,"a little over a month ago I tried to kill myself because of how shitty life was. my parents made life living hell every single day, and I was just tired of suffering. one of the only 2 people that actually cared about me found me and saved my life. 

after that I wanted to try and get better, I reached out for help before it happened, but then people actually realized I needed help. my parents started to show some care, but not enough. they came too little too late. 

now I'm down to only one person that cares about me and she feels like a ghost to me. I try to do everything I can for her and it just feels like she's gone. nobody cares, I'm just alone and suffering. I'm tired of it. after an hour an half phone call yelling session from my parents I finally broke. I'm done with everything. I'm tired of suffering and it's not going to get better.

after that call something finally snapped inside of me. I want to be alive anymore. I have nothing left, no one left. I am alone and suffering. 

this sub is truly amazing and I'm grateful that there are people out there who care for total strangers. goodbye reddit."
2118,Am I broken?,"I have a good life with a wonderful family and friends but I still feel a shadow behind me ready to strike at any moment. I never feel good and always pretend in front of everyone. I’m scared to die but I don’t want to live too
."
2119,Change,"Sometimes I feel like quitting my job, selling all my shit, and leaving everyone behind to travel across the country and restart somewhere else..."
2120,"Nobody in my life cares about me, no one at all. I'm sick of feeling so alone.","I'm left with absolutely no one who cares about me. And the people I'm around are only around because the feel like they're obligated to be, aka my family. I always think about how if I were anyone else, they would probably not want to know me, just like everyone else.

People always say that you should go to your friends and family if you want support. But nobody cares, and I cant believe it. I feel so hated, like it's supposed to be this way. Like maybe I've never even been the slightest bit likeable ever. And the thing is people used to care, at one point my family was so much gentler and kind and compassionate with me. And I used to have a lot of friends. But now I can feel how I'm bringing everyone down when I talk to people in my family. It's been so long since I've had someone just hug me and try to understand. It's like everyone just gave up on me. Most of my friends left all at once, and the rest trickled off one by one. The last friend I had (who unfortunately I had feelings for and still kind of do) stuck around for a lot more than the other and I thought maybe they'd be the one I could count on. But of course, they stopped talking to me and I still dont know what happened. Now I see them interacting with their new friends on social media, and looking out for them and saying nice things. And I'm happy that at least they're doing well, but I cant help wishing they would still be there for me.

I cant even make one single friend, and it's been three years since I've been trying. And I've been trying so hard. I feel so alone and trapped where I am, I just cant take it anymore. I want so badly more than anything sometimes to get better and prove to myself that I can do it. But other times I'm reminded of what's going on, and I'm really afraid that this is it and theres no way to get out.

I kept thinking to myself that I would never post here because it would be admitting to myself that things are actually this bad. But they are so what's the point. I'm so tired, and so upset it hurts."
2121,No one ever listens,"I have been depressed, suicidal for quite some time now. I thought or atleast I've read, if you tell someone maybe they will help. I finally found the courage to say something to someone, which was my mom and she said ""ok and?"" It feels like no one will actually care until you are dead. What is the point of asking for help when no one cares?"
2122,Fuck it,Literally just fuck it lol fuck this fuck that fuck me always going back to square one which is just being alone crying then trying to numb it only to act like nothing happened tomorrow and no one knows I’m just living this sad ass life alone but you’ll catch me posting on my story like I’m having the time of it and fuck that too I hate it
2123,Why did I think I was finally past this last night and feeling so low today?,"22m here, last night I went out and drank a bit with two friends. I was kinda meh most of the night when I got home I popped my earphones in and listened to music a little drunk, I danced in my living room to my music and I finally felt free of depression. I could only think about how careless and weightless I felt and I kept telling myself I was finally free of the sadness. This morning I woke up really sad again. I thought I had finally found myself for once. How do I bring back that feeling or carelessness.!"
2124,"I’ll be lonely forever, no matter what.","I’m in a long term relationship, reconciled with most family members, have friends, and yet feel completely alone in this world. 

I feel like there’s not a soul that truly knows me or knows what I’m talking about when I try to explain the way I think. I feel like I can never get through to people and they can never get through to me.

I remember being a little child and feeling alone. As an adult I’ve learned to accept that I will always feel this way. I’m just glad that I learned to be nice to myself so at least I have me. 

Sometimes I dream of disappearing into thin air. But even though I feel alone I’m still aware that I have people that care about me. It might sound terrible but they just feel like chains keeping me here. If it weren’t for the people that care about me, I’d be gone. But I’m stuck here because I don’t want to hurt them:/ 

Bleh."
2125,Yeh thanks guys soo much,Thanks “FRIENDS” thanks for joking and making fun of my depression... my hobbies. It’s really making me happier thanks alotttt
2126,Having friends and doing things doesn’t make me feel any better,"I still feel isolated romantically and physically I still think about suicide daily I still can’t even think straight I still miss my ex despite all the tinder matches I still am completely useless and I still am gonna fuck up college as soon as it starts and I don’t know what I’ll do after that. I know it’s going to go terribly, maybe I’ll finally strap some balls on and do it"
2127,"Genuinely, Help doesn't help me.","In the past few years for me, I have been extremely fucking depressed. I fucking hide all true feelings about depression from family and therapists, &amp; doctors. I live behind a false fucking mask to them. Recently I went to a psychology ward for help from the school's therapist. I was reported from an ex-friend of mine the morning before to the staff &amp; therapist. After that week, nothing changed. I fucking lied to everyone just to leave. I have had psychology therapy for depression over the past 2 weeks. Shit doesn't fucking help me. Nobody understands. I've come back to where I was before going to the psych ward. I am literally lying to almost everyone I know, I say almost since there are dark jokes I say in classes here and there. I am literally on the edge. So much contemplation, but I feel like I can't do it yet if that makes any sense. I feel like i am just rambling here. Sorry.. Though my suicide will happen soon enough. I feel it within the next 2 years. Anyone who says go get fucking help can fuck off. cause it never helped me. nothing has or ever fucking will.

fuck life i want to fucking die"
2129,I have no idea what to do with my life anymore,"What should I even do with my life anymore, I just feel trapped. Everything has just became too overwhelming for me to handle.

 Me and my closest friend drifted apart, she meant everything to me and she always had my back and I always had hers. Over the years I noticed that she didn't want to spend time with me anymore, our conversations have gotten shorter and it just wasnt the same. 

I wished it could've lasted a little longer, I wish I can be in her arms, I just wish we could've done a little more before this. She was everything to me but now it's gone."
2130,Anyone just trying to get past Christmas?,"I really hate Christmas. My presence in people’s lives is required, not requested. 
It seems the worst thing in the world I could do would be to show or worse, act on my depression - ‘but it’s Christmas’.
I just imagine over and over again my parents not being able to enjoy Christmas anymore because I couldn’t wait. I’m actually at the age now where I remember thinking the exact same thing last Christmas....just get through Christmas - then you can do what you want. Now I’m here again, a year later, and I feel the same way. Little things have kept me going this year- I couldn’t possibly before my nieces christening, before my sisters wedding etc etc. I think at this point I live my life in increments, in ‘just get passed this event’, for them. Christmas is only the latest one of those increments."
2131,I dont know anymore,"I'm 22 years old, very obbesed, jobless, no friends and i hate my self more than anything. Affraid to end my life but yet my existance has no purposed. Is anything will get better? Because i think no light in the world will overcome it"
2132,"Feeling depressed, sad. Being jobless...","Just wanted to share my feelings. Not sure if I am depressed but reading here I do feel connected. I do want to get a job someday in the future but not something like cleaning the toilet. That outlook just makes me feel more sad and I know that I can do so much more just my inside and outside are not align....
Feeling like I have no clear way. 
Thanks for reading!"
2133,No one understands,"Sorry English is not my first language. 

I don’t know if I’m really suffered depression or not, but no one around me understands it. It’s not like I’m sad, because of my exams or my relationship. I can’t get out of bed or sleep before 4 am, I can’t get up to wash my clothes, or the dishes, or even to cook. I skipped breakfast and lunch, not because I want to, I can eat like a horse, but I can’t get out of bed to do so. So in others eyes, I am a lazy, dirty shit. And I won’t ever change, I use depression as my excuse. My roommate is the type of person who is clean, healthy regulation, self-disciplined. Last night, she just can’t handle it anymore, she talk about how can I be so lazy, and dirty, why don’t I want to change? I don’t know, maybe because I can’t change, when there is this thing, it tortures me, in my thoughts, I can’t even explain it and she can’t understand it, she will never understand it. So she is moving out, I’m going to go back to my routine, but like losing some friends. 
I’ve known her 10 years, but we weren’t meant to live together, we’ve just live for a year, and everyone else in my highschool won’t ask me to hang out in groups anymore because of our conflict"
2135,Fuck,"I just wanna be tranquilized. At this time of night, my body's up, but my brain's dead. Maybe that's a sign of things to come, in life, once again."
2137,Mirror,"I'm fine until I look in the Mirror.
I can wear a mask for everyone else, but the Mirror shows me the truth. 
No one can see me through my mask, no one knows it's a mask at all.
I feel great behind the mask and all is well.
Then I look in the Mirror. 
It all crashes down when I see myself in the Mirror.
There is no escape from my own eyes in the Mirror.
My eyes know the truth, me eyes see through the mask. 
The man in the Mirror knows.
He knows how pathetic I am, he know how much I've messed up, he knows all my faults, he knows all the mistakes, he knows all my insecurities, and his eyes in the Mirror crush my soul.
The mask falls away in the Mirror.
I hate the Mirror.
The man looking back in the Mirror hates me.

Depression is a horrible thing to have for anyone, being a 50 year old male in a good marriage with good kids and grandkids.....its a NIGHTMARE.

The mask is my only protection, my only defense.

Depression is like a hunter that never sleeps, never let's you rest to catch your breath.

Be strong!! 
Never show weakness! 
Men dont have depression! 
Have a beer, it will pass! 
Dont be a pussy, get over it!
Work harder!
What you need a shrink!

Fuck it, I'm going into my middle age, I can wear the mask another couple decades, my family needs me to.
I hate the Mirror, I really do.

""Puts mask back on"" 
I'm sorry, I'll be on my way. 
Have a good day!......"
2138,I know a bridge in my city. I will jump from it tonight.,"I can do it at any time. In a way this brings me peace.

At any point. 
I will just not exist. 
The easy way out.
I will do it tonight.
 They would never find my body.
 The current would simply carry what is left of me away. 
Me and life are simply not compatible.
I don't want anymore of their ""help.""
I don't want anymore of their platitudes.
I don't want anymore of this. Nothing will convince me to care about a worthless existence.

Aside from random internet people no one will know what happened to me. I will just disappear. And that's how I want it.

Goodbye, brothers and sisters. I will see you all on the other side, if there is one. And if there's nothing, that's fine too. Nothingness is better than this."
2139,I just want to die,"I lived a pretty normal life until things started going downhill and my dad died 2 years ago, I've been depressed and wanting to end it all every day, my gf was the only person helping me through this and then she cheated on me, every night I cry myself to sleep and all I want is for this to be all over and the only way I can find is ending it for good."
2140,I feel like I cant get help,I was diagnosed a while ago. None of the medication works and Ive had so many suicide attempts. The most recent werent calls for help. I really wanted to go. I dont try anymore because it seems no matter what I do i survive. I dont see a therapist anymore because i cant afford it. Ive recently considered that I may have had adhd this whole time as well. Long before the depression even hit. I went to the doctor to talk to them about it and I was dismissed because of my age. But he said he would put in  a referal and i was then put on a waitlist. A waitlist for fucks sakes. Even after getting off those waitlists appointments can be a year out. I tried just calling a place and setting up an appointment and it worked but I can afford to go. I feel like I cant afford to be alive. I sleep all day. Im always worried about money. I dont have any friends. I dont do anything and I really really hate myself. I cant do anything right. Ill try and Ill try and nothing. I dont want to have to go through this for the rest of my life. I used to be able to go to work no problem but now I want to call in sick everyday just so I can sleep some more. School is absolute hell. I never know whats going on. Ive spent my entire life failing every class I take and having to work 5 times as hard as the person next to me. It takes me days to do one homework assignment and others are done in an hour. I dont know what to do anymore. Im just tired.
2141,I'm beyond burntout,"I have no motivation to do anything. Everything and I mean literally everything feels impossible to do. I have a final exam in literally 9 hours, and I've barely even started reading one of the 15 60-page lecture slides. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I haven't been showing up for classes unless it's for quizzes or midterms. I have no faith at all for passing any of my courses this term. It's like, I wanna start the engine and get my ass to actually save my term, but the tank literally doesn't even have fumes to burn. 

It's just so difficult."
2143,I need to seek help but I just... can’t?,"Hi,

I’m (F20) in an intense depressive period and have been for a few months. It’s starting to negatively affect those around me but I just can’t make an appointment. I usually make normal doctors appointments online but my hospital makes you call to schedule mental health appointments and it makes me extremely anxious to think about. I am so miserable but making an appointment is so hard for me. And what if I go through all of that trouble and end up having a psychologist that’s not right for me? Then I have to go through the process all over again..."
2144,I lost my best friend because I was too depressed,I don’t know what to do. She told my other friend she didn’t want to hear about my problems anymore. We’d been friends at least six years and I had a bad year and she threw it all away because of that. No happy birthday. Refuses to see me. Doesn’t say hi when she passes me. It’s like I’m dead to her.
2145,PSA for any Zoloft newbies,"My doc prescribed me low-dose (25 mg) Zoloft. I took my first dose without issue, second dose (which was tonight), I was a dummy and forgot to take it with food. Don’t do that, guys. Learn from my dumbass mistake as I sit here with the worst goddamn heartburn I’ve ever had in my life. Eat a piece of bread or cheese or something with it. Just don’t repeat my mistake, and forgot god’s sake DO NOT DRY SWALLOW IT. (Something else I did wrong here). This has been a PSA, thank you for coming to my TED talk."
2146,Anyone wanna Talk it's at its worst,Got rejected today and its 3am dont want to sleep and ig just want someone to talk to

2148,“You are in charge of your own mental state”. If only it was that easy my friend.,"Everyone lives their lives. They carry their own problems, their own working lives, their own social lives. I don’t understand. Nobody, not one person goes out of their way to help me or others in terrible pain. Nobody asks ‘are you ok’ unless you show signs. People say ‘the change starts with you’. How do i do that when i don’t have the motivation to do so? I look and look and i cant find it. Ive been looking for so long. Its not there. This world is fucked up, guys. You and i are the only ones who see that. Everyone is for themselves and they see the world in colour. We see the world in black and white. Theres no depth, no volume to anything. We only see the two shades that make up this universe. Light and darkness. You live in the light you get shot down by others. You live in the dark, nobody can see you. Im too far into the darkness. Nobody can see me anymore."
2149,Support from the Internet means nothing to me,"I keep hearing these comments telling people to keep going but even if I got a million comments on this post telling me to keep living it won't do anything at all, you don't know me. A complete stranger can't truly entirely care about someone they don't even fucking know. Why would you even want to care about me, a stranger on the internet?"
2150,I think my meds are working,"Its been 2.5 months and I'm starting to ease up. Had to change the meds once but i think fluoxetine is working. 

There's still hope guys, good luck"
2151,Realized i was depressed today,"I’ve been feeling lonely, unenergetic, and sad recently but today was the first day it really hit me that I am depressed.

This sounds like a bad thing but there is a bit of weight taken off my shoulders. I’ve acknowledged this problem and now I can try to appropriately deal with it"
2152,I'm afraid of my own shadow,"I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm running in circles trying to run away from the shadow, while also being self aware enough to know that I shouldn't be running. I feel like I'm detaching from reality. Almost like I'm developing psychosis or something. My thoughts are erratic. I can't seem to focus on anything for more than 3 seconds. It's almost like being in a constant state of adrenalin. It doesn't stop. I'm taking meds for my MDD btw. I can't stop looking around. I think random stuff at random times, I feel like I'm getting dumber by the day. I'm even becoming less and less mature if that's the right wording. I don't know what to do. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. I'm just afraid."
2153,Tonight I mourn,"tonight i mourn over myself, for i am weak. i cannot live through a semester without failing a class. i cannot function without a support animal. i cannot let a day go by without disappointing my loved ones. 

i mourn for my strength that carried me through my childhood. i mourn for the laughter that filled my breath. i mourn the good times that died so long ago.

tonight i remember the days i could go to sleep and think tomorrow will be better. tonight i go to sleep knowing it'll all be for nothing. tonight i remember my sisters, my precious sisters, who love me with all their hearts. tonight i remember i am not a good example for them as i promised i would be.

i mourn myself, since i am different, a void, lacking, unhappy, depressed, forgotten, weak."
2154,Being alone just fucking sucks,"Straight up. The single life is not for me. I'd like to have someone who just willing talks to me often and hangs out whenever possible and actually wants to. Building such a strong bond with someone in that capacity is so appealing to me. I just can't seem to be able to find people. I'm just so romantically starved. That kinda makes it dangerous because I don't want to jump into something too quickly, but I also feel like I'm barely in control. I'm not banking on a romantic relationship to fix my mental issues, but I think it would definitely make life more bearable and I know it would give me some sense of purpose. I know I would still be able to maintain my independence though because I don't want to lose my mind if things don't work out. Maybe I won't even make it that far. Everyone in the house will be gone for new years eve. At least 3 hours. Maybe more. If I just swallowed a bunch of pills, there would be no saving me. If I slit my wrists, or hung myself. It makes me feel wrong for thinking these things, but I do it all the time. In class, during conversations, walking around. All the time. Constantly. If I'm honest, I'm probably beyond help at this point. There just isn't much left for me. I used to feel better after writing things like these, but now it almost makes me feel more depressed knowing that nobody really reads these and I'm just always screaming my thoughts at a void. Everything just keeps getting worse and worse. I don't want to talk about it anymore, I just want it to be over, or maybe this is just my cry for help. At this point, I don't even know what's going on anymore. I'm just so weak and I'm not sure how much longer I can make it on my own"
2155,The foreign concept known as “work” - Why in the actual fuck would I want a job?,"It’s not like I’ve never had a job. Shit, some jobs I’ve had I was actually kind of good at. But the type of job is ultimately irrelevant - all of them possess the same, universal soul-sucking quality that turns my life into a cycle of: wake up, hate my life, go to work, hate my life, go home, hate my life, sleep, repeat. 

Work, without fail, consumes my life. Hobbies and things I once found enjoyment in go right out the window, landing softly in the bushes right next to what was left of my sanity. The second I get off work, I have to begin mentally preparing myself for... another fucking day of work.

Any time I try and talk with people about it, I either get hit with the age-old classic “Hurrrr DURRRRR THAT’S LIFE, WHADDYA GONNA DO?” or they’ll say “Maybe your job just isn’t a good fit for you. What’s your dream job? What are you interested in?”

I’m interested in not fucking working. Thank you for asking.

I really can’t do this for the rest of my life. Is this really what my life is going to be? I go to work at a job that I can’t fucking stand, just so I can make enough money to stay alive, just so I can continue to go to work at a job that I can’t fucking stand? And I do this until I die? Why wouldn’t I just cut out the middleman and skip to the credits of this fucking nightmare?

I can’t be the only one who feels this way, but I’ve yet to find someone in real life that does. Sure, I know many people that don’t *like* work, but they deal with it because it’s something you have to do.

I can’t deal with it. I really wish I could. I’m past the point where I can even pretend that I can deal with it. How the fuck am I going to put on a smile again when this is sucking the life right out of me?

If I don’t work, I’ll die, but I’m fucking dead inside already"
2156,Anyone else feel like they are the most boring person on earth,"I’ve always been a very quiet person, I keep to myself, but like GOD DAMN every time I open my mouth it’s something stupid and meaningless. I have nothing interesting to say ever, I don’t do anything cool so I just sit there and wait for the other person to make conversation, and I even struggle to keep up with it. I just can’t think of anything funny, smart or human to say anymore I’m just a FUCKING robot at this point. I’m so exhausted mentally that I just can’t think anymore, I can’t do it."
2157,Falling asleep,"Just for a bit of backstory' I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety and mild depression.

Idk what it is but i cant fall asleep at night when I'm alone. When I was with my ex I never used to have to be on my phone to sleep. Simply being there next to her kept my anxiety down and I was able to sleep very easily. 

Unfortunately we broke up about 2 months ago and I've been really struggling to find a way to fall asleep like I used to. Typically when I go to bed I will set my phone down with my alarms but I cant fall asleep. I'm talking like 2 hours of just laying there in my thoughts not able to even get drowsy. For the past week I've found being on my phone scrolling through reddit helps but it take quiet a bit of time to fall asleep. 

Is there anything any way for me to fall asleep easier that anyone knows of? If questions are needed I'm fine with responding."
2158,How to make friends while having depression?,"Like the title says.   I’ve lost a lot of friends because of depression, either through isolation or my irritable-ness.  So, I have a few friends at home and none at my college.  Have any of y’all been able to make friends while being depressed?  If so, how?  Thank you and try to have a good day."
2159,Sometimes I question whether any of my friends actually like me,"There's always this looming feeling that they just hate me and get annoyed when I talk with them. Like whenever I speak to them, they just want to avoid and leave me. Maybe it's true. Sometimes I wonder if they only talk with me because they feel bad and that they're stuck with me. I mean I get where they're coming from. It's not really fun being friends with me. I suck up all the joy and energy and I'm just a terrible person overall. I always have this fear that my gut feeling is right and the truth is, they just hope to get rid of me as soon as possible."
2160,I couldn’t do it,"My friend just turned 21, and she’s having a party. Myself and a couple other close friends were invited. We all showed up and there were a lot more people than I expected. My friend’s 21 now so of course theres people getting all sorts of fucked up, but I’m DD so there’s no way I’m drinking. But even if I did drink, i feel like I wouldnt enjoy myself. I’ve suffered from social anxiety throughout the majority of my life, but here it peaked. All these people here, from college frats or sororities, these people who all know each other, smoking and drinking their lives away, but then theres me. I’ve gotten better since the start of college last year, but only with one small group at a time and this... was different. My friends split off to their own groups, and I was just left there, hands shaking from my anxiety. That’s the worst feeling. I hate it. Being the odd one out. its happened so many times before. Yeah I’ve tried joining in the conversations, but no success. So I left, and now I’m here, typing this in my car. Alone. Contemplating why I even came in the first place."
2161,i’ve been listening to the same music for 2 years straight,listening to new music takes so much energy ): also with movies. i’ve had so many movies i’ve wanted to watch this year but just haven’t. i just spend my days sleeping and scrolling through twitter
2162,Good Ol Quarter Life Crisis,"I couldn’t find rules for this sub so I’m sorry if I break any. I just don’t know what to do and I’m using my last resort of reaching out to strangers on the internet, which I know is risky because even a single “kill yourself” or “you’re being over dramatic” comment might send me over the edge tbfh lmao

I think I’m in a crisis. Or I’m on my way to one at least. I’m trying to prevent the crisis, but it’s like trying to build a wall to prevent a tsunami. Only the wall is made out of twigs and hot glue. Also it’s only 10 feet high while the tsunami is a mile high.

I’m just so fucking scared of what I may do in the next month or so. I’ve been feeling like I’m “on my way to kill myself lol” for a while now. It feels inevitable. I talk about what I want my future to be like, with a career and husband and kids and house, with no real hope of that stuff actually happening because “I’ll be dead lmao.” I keep joking about it because it’s all I can do.

I feel so scared and alone. Everyone else seems to have their shit together. Even the ones that claim to be depressed seem to be going to work and school and social events with no fucking problems. Then there’s me, who has to smoke weed every day just to feel like my day was worth living through. Getting high at night, my boyfriend, and my cat are the only things I’m living for tbfh.

I’m close to self-harming again, which I don’t wanna do because of what happened last time I did it (I traumatized myself lmao go me). And my scars healed not long ago, so do I really want to ruin my 1.5+ years of sobriety from self-harm?... Not really. But I feel like I’m gonna do it anyway because... idk, I guess I’m so stuck in my own head and tired of feeling things that aren’t real (depression, anxiety, irritability, boredom, insecurity, lack of energy, etc.). At least physical pain would be real. 

At what point do I go to the crisis center? I’m not self harming or attempting suicide... yet. But I’m afraid I will get to that point if something doesn’t give. I resent going to work because it just makes me so. fucking. MISERABLE. No, it’s not just “the daily grind.” It may be to my coworkers and every fucking body else on this planet. But I don’t see it as a means to an end. I see it as THE end... of ME. 

I just don’t know what to do. Group therapy sucks ASS, NO it does not help me, YES I have tried it multiple times thanks and I think I know what works for me better than some stupid fucking studies that aren’t 10000% accurate. 

I’m just so mad at the world and feel like no one would give a shit if I offed myself. I’m too scared of dying though to actually do it. So I’m stuck in an endless cycle that there seems to be no breaking out of."
2163,I'm a delusion for my father and i can't stop being it.,"In the last week, i told my parents that i want to change school. Now i am in a scientific school and i want  to attend a musical one, instead.
Since i was a little kid, i always told my father that i'll become an architect, but three years ago, i understood that that work isn't for me. I really love playing the guitar and i'd love to become a guitarist in the future. So, today i had a bad quarrel with my father because of my dream and he called me a delusion. This hurt me a lot, because i always wanted to be the perfect son for him and now i just can't stop being a delusion. I only wanted to make him proud."
2164,A letter to myself.,"I’m sorry for hurting you. I’m sorry for putting the opinions of others before your own. I’m sorry for using unhealthy coping mechanisms to heal but you were hurting yourself even further. I’m sorry it’s taking you so long to learn how to love yourself and to accept the past because you fear it’ll be your present and future. I’m sorry you aren’t good enough but I’m even more sorry you think that way because of your horrible mistakes, but that’s all they are; mistakes. I’m sorry it’s taking you so long to learn that they’re in the past and it’s taking you forever to accept that you cannot change them and you have to live with it but more importantly learn from them. I’m sorry you let yourself be belittled so much by people you thought cared for you but they were only manipulating you. I’m sorry you’re still using unhealthy coping mechanisms right now to make yourself feel better but you know it’s only hurting you just like it did in the past. I’m sorry you think you’re not good enough. I’m sorry for hurting you and not feeling like you can change. I’m sorry you think you’ll be the same person you were 5 months ago, more importantly 7 months ago when you made a huge mistake that makes you think that’ll be who you are forever. The biggest mistake of your entire life. I’m sorry you feel like you’ll be that way your entire life and that’s your identity; a mistake you made because of your self-esteem. Your low self-esteem. I’m sorry for putting you through so much heart ache and letting you feel like you deserve nothing because of mistakes you made. I’m sorry you’re depressed because of your past and that you think it’ll be your present, future, and identity. I’m sorry for hurting you.  I’m sorry for blaming you for every single thing that happened to you. I know you made your own mistakes but you’re still blaming yourself for mistakes, maybe even just actions; I don’t think they see it as mistakes, maybe they just see it as actions and don’t feel regret. It’s not even a maybe, you know they don’t feel bad. I’m sorry you think that if you were better, they wouldn’t treat you like this. I’m sorry you’ll feel that way for a very long time. I’m proud of you for getting the help you need and bettering yourself, or just even talking to someone, someone professional. I’m proud of you for recognizing these unhealthy patterns and wanting to make a change. I’m proud of you for slowly, very slowly, putting your foot down and allowing yourself to be happy again even when you think, or know, you don’t deserve it because of your past. I’m sorry you feel you can’t forgive yourself because if you did you’d be okay with the mistake, the biggest one you ever made, you’re bound to do it again. I’m sorry for treating you lesser than a person."
2165,Anyone experience extreme boredom on Abilify?,"I started abilify not too long ago and I can’t even describe how incredibly dull everything feels. I find everything super uninteresting and can’t hold my concentration on anything for very long. I can’t find anything appealing for more than a few minutes and it’s making me feel like I’m mentally coming unhinged from how dull life is. I never know what to do during the day because everything seems so boring. Abilify itself doesn’t seem to have the direct side effect of making me more depressed, however, the resulting boredom is making my mood worse as time goes on. I had the same experience with Geodon and I’m wondering if other people have had similar experiences with Abilify/other antipsychotics or have some insight on this situation."
2166,Anyone found a way to manage oversleeping/hypersomnia?,"I sleep 12-14 hours per day and sometimes nap, too. I am *always* tired and I genuinely don't remember the last time I felt awake/energetic.

I take Wellbutrin and it helps with some aspects of depression but not at all with oversleeping. It's ruining my life because there aren't enough waking hours in the day for me to actually work/eat/shower/fun. 

Has anyone else found meds that help?"
2167,My mom died yesterday and I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault,"Ever since my parents divorced and my mom moved away for work I started seeing her less and less over the years, but every time I did I could see she was getting worse mentally and physically. She was overworked and I have no idea how stressed she must’ve been and I just feel like I pushed it over the edge. We argued more and more as time passed and I just stopped wanting to visit her or call her because I just knew what was to come and I didn’t want to deal with that. She’d text me saying she loved me and wish I’d call her and talk to her and I just ignored and now I’ll never get the chance to talk to her again. I already knew she was going through a lot and I feel like had I just talked to her maybe even once more she’d still be here. I’m so sorry mom"
2168,I was doing so good.. damn,I usually just get drunk when I start feeling sad and then I’m good for a little while until I drink again. I’ve been good for months but now that I’ve decided not 2  drink this shit is catching up 2 me and I’m feelin down.. damn
2169,My relationship of 5 years just ended.,"I don't do much, and all I did was with her. What am I supposed to do? I just wanna sink into the floor and die. It would hurt less than anything else."
2170,"I am trying to hard to pull myself out of this secluded, uninspired depression, but every time I try to socialize I feel like someone pushes me out.","I just really feel like I'm always the person to get interrupted. Every time I try to be a part of a conversation it happens, or someone like, hyper-corrects whatever I'm saying and it turns into an argument. I even work at a bar, where you'd think I'd be a part of social situations anyway, but I'm just not a person people have any interest in talking to I guess? And this isn't for lack of trying, I try to involve myself in conversation in my friends' group chat and feel like I'm just shut down or argued out of participating, and I'm never even trying to argue. So I lay in bed all day and don't eat or do anything productive because I'm just dreading the next awkward moment that I try to have conversation and am shit on. I also try to just socialize by commenting on reddit, and I'm always downvoted or attacked or something, and I really don't know why this happens to me. My husband says that it isn't me and I'm just overthinking it, because i also have wild anxiety, but if that's the case why tf does it happen daily? I'm just trying to be a person but all I want to do is hide, has anyone here overcame that feeling?"
2171,Please help me ...,I’m just so far gone right now... I can’t think of any reason to keep on living for people. I’m just a disappointment to everyone and nobody cares or wants me in their life. I care for everyone who comes in my life but the way the world works is just getting me more and more depressed.
2172,I don't know if this is good or not but I wanted to post it,Dearest dark you've eaten me whole with glutenes intent with no remourse if you somehow manage to see this please let me go...
2173,I don’t have a best friend,"I’m afraid of being judged, some of my past friend groups were very judgemental and would often throw insults at each other such as, “dumb ass”. I had this one friend who was the most negative person I have met in my life. These are the following things she has said about others: “I do not want to marry someone who has genetic health issues running in his family” and “I want to get into Medical School to become a radiologist so I make big bucks and don’t talk to people” you get the picture. 

These are the following things she has said to me; pathetic, dumb, dumb ass (I don’t even remember the rest). She would make lots of morbid jokes and suicide jokes. In fact, the last time I hung out with her in person was with our other friend Anna* and she told me how she wanted to get a tattoo on her arm. As a joke I told her she should get my face on. She said that she would add a noose around my neck and have the rope trail up her shoulder. I was mortified. When Anna left, I confronted her and told her that it wasn’t cool and she said “I’ll try to not be a douche bag next time”. Later I confided in Anna and she told me she took it only as a joke. Weeks passed and I couldn’t shake that off. I decided to have a talk with her on the phone. I told her how I found her judgementalness to be difficult because I don’t know if she’s judging me or not and how I’m afraid about expressing myself. She told me she doesn’t judge me. Then I told her that the joke really bothered me because she knew I was suicidal and dealing with depression. She told me (and I will never forget these words) “I can’t know what you expect me to say” and that was it. I knew then and there our friendship was over.   Anna was still friends with her.

Now it’s been two years, I transferred Universities for other reasons. Just last night Anna had a birthday party. People could sleep over if they wished, I didn’t because I knew that my ex friend would be there. (Anna told me she was coming and that I don’t have to come if I don’t want to). I decided not to sleep over because I wasn’t sure if she was. She ended up sleeping over. 

Throughout the evening Anna was oddly friendly towards that ex friend, for example, calling her babe numerous times and after reading her bday card say “awwww baaabe” and my card she didn’t say anything. 

Night came and I was tired. My friend and I were making plans on what time we should leave. The ex friend peeped up and said “you guys should do the skid-addles soon”. Basically, I felt very uncomfortable and awkward and out of place. I felt like I was the bad guy and Anna was just pretending to be my friend or something around those lines. I felt very unwelcome and I regret going. Right now I’m quite upset and I’m seriously questioning my friendship with Anna. She does not try to keep in contact with me regularly and she would text me once every two, three months (she says she’s too busy because of Nursing school). I’m at my wits end. Should I just keep her as a casual friend? Or should I burn this bridge? I’m really not sure what the best option would be and I’m so confused about my feelings. My depression has been getting bad and I’ve been crying lots. I just don’t feel like I have a friend I can really rely on. I always feel like they will get annoyed with me or something. I just wish I have a best friend. Anyways if you read this far, thank you, you’re the real MVP."

2175,Hopeless hope,"You might say that I'm insane but that's just how I like it to be, because I would rather be my own freak than anything even close to you. You can take your shot and say what you want because that's all that you have got. You can bring me to my knees and see exactly what you've done, broken dreams and false regards are all that I can see."
2176,Afraid of death,"I know when I'm going to go and how but I'm still afraid. Not of dying, but scared that I might survive it. I can not face anyone i know if it doesn't work. I've already started making my amends with friends who I've had issues with and I'm just waiting now. I can barely sleep without nightmares of either dying painfully or surviving. I just want everything to end now. Please that's really all I want."
2177,What's wrong with me?,"I don't understand what I ever did to deserve what I'm going through. I've always been a great kid, I never got in trouble at school, my grades weren't great and to this day in my senior year of high school I still struggle with doing my homework. I'm never rude to anyone unless they give me a reason to dislike them, I never ask for much. The most expensive thing I've ever asked for was a Nintendo 3ds when I was 11. I've recently starting fighting a lot more with my family, but before I was extremely close to my mother.

I can't think of what I possibly could have done to deserve the years of abuse I've suffered through.

I don't get why so many people hate me, or why I'm not important enough to be anyone's priority. Why are my sister's suicidal thoughts more important than mine? Is it because of something I've done without realizing it? Am I not good enough for anyone? Is it simply because of the way I look?

What's wrong with me? Why does everyone hate me?? I haven't done anything wrong..

I'm such an outcast that no one here sees anything I post, and even the other outcadts in my school don't want anything to do with me."
2178,Today was the closest I have come to killing myself,"I’m a 35 year old male who has recently lost his job, his girlfriend of a year, with less than $100 in the bank and am now soon to be homeless due to my girlfriend wanting me to move out. I never cheated or was abusive but my depression and low self esteem has driven everything important to me out of my life. I never would have thought that I would be in this position and honestly have never been so scared, embarrassed and ashamed. I have struggled with suicidal ideations a lot this week and today everything came to a head. My glock was loaded and in all honestly I just held it and thought ill kill myself in one minute, ill kill myself in five more minutes. I don’t know why I didn’t and I’m scared that at some point soon I still may. My therapist saved my fucking life today and I can’t stop crying. I’m going to quit drinking and try my best to stay positive. If you feel like hurting yourself please know that you aren’t alone and there’s always someone that cares even if its a stranger on the internet. If you read this thank you for letting me vent, as pathetic as it is, my therapist and this sub were all that i had today and im grateful for everyone here. Hope you guys have a great night."
2179,smile,"i live with a hole in my chest. i fake my smile to everyone i see and sometimes it feels real, but other times i break down in front of my boyfriend and no one else because he's the only one i respect enough to cry in front of. my cat gives me company, though. my life is good and great, just sometimes i'm fucked in the head."
2180,i have no idea,"i don't feel anything

I don't think i am depressed i dont even know what i am i just dont feel anything

im sick of everyone im sick of all my friends because no one really cares about me or anything else

everyone is selfish and everyone only cares about themselves in the end

i would love to go off the grid and lose connection with everyone i have ever known

no on is reliable in this world and you cant trust anyone or count on anyone to do anything and i am so sick of it

this world is evil and im sick of seeing it everywhere 

i feel like im going crazy and i feel like im losing it i feel like i am the only one who is seeing all the bullshit in this world and seeing that everyone only cares about themselves and no one truly cares about anyone else im not sad im not happy i literally do not feel a single thing i feel absolutely numb i cant even form the words to express what im trying to say

basically i wish i could drive and never look back and throw my phone away and live somewhere with no internet or television or anything but also the thought of that isnt exactly exciting i dont necessarily want to die but i have zero interest in living the bland life that i live right now i feel like i live the same day over and over again and all the months are running together and time doesnt even feel real because it all feels like the same day .

im finished hopefully there is one person in the world that can relate to this because i feel alone in my thoughts"
2181,I feel so lonely,"im 16 and ive dealt with moderate to severe depression and anxiety since i was about 14. so at school im seen as the weird queit type so no one really wants to talk to me other than 1 of my friends. ive never been in a relationship so i dont know what love is like from someone other than mom. even then she talks bad about me because my grades are bad.

honestly i feel stuck and i just want out of this.
the only time i feel ""alive"" is when im at my friends house during the weekends. but other than that ive got no REAL human interaction other than people that think im weird and my 1 friend.

what do i do?"
2182,I can't stop feeling bad for people I shouldn't,"My parents are probably mentally disabled in some way, because the way they act makes my heart ache. They also hate each other. One time, my mom threatened to commit suicide over an argument, and we had to call the police and be interviewed. 

Seeing my parents become children, seeing them have no power over me or my siblings feels so wrong. I want to respect them as parental figures but I just can't, because they never were. My siblings and I have so much hate towards my dad because he used to be physically abusive, and it would make sense for me to constantly be angry at him.

...But I feel so bad for him that it even affects me. What kind of grown man has to lock himself in his hermit bedroom because his kids scolded him? He's not of retirement age, but has been unemployed for 9 years. He's been a hermit for 9 years, abusing us for part of it and I know he's depressed I know something in our family is so wrong and I know somewhere in my genes is the reason why I take antidepressants too.

But I can't help him. He's a depressed person who has stayed in his bedroom, useless, for 9 years. When he does come out, most of the time a fight or argument breaks out. When was the last time my dad was ever happy? Has he ever been happy... the marriage turned bad pretty quickly after all.

I can't stop crying right now because an arugment broke out between my siblings and him as usual and it ended with him feeling offended and locking himself in his room again. I can't look at him like my dad and it hurts. I don't like seeing people suffer, let alone my parents that were never really my parents...

I hate that I feel bad for him, it's a sick feeling. I wish I was angry at him, and I should be.. He's part of the reason I'm depressed, and he sure as hell never helped, but I don't think anyone in the world should feel that way, even though there are so many who do..."
2183,sadness b weighing me down,"i told one of my friends about something that's been hard on me and made me want to die. when i told my friend how i felt they told me ""it isn't truly that bad."" it really hurt me but i still ended up having to a apologize. I understand things could be worse but are my problems not enough for you to care? i get it that i shouldn't be treated like a baby but her words really hurt me. I guess i just sound pathetic and like a loser to everyone at this point when i explain how i feel."
2184,I just wanted to say we can do it!,"Whatever it is you need to or want to get done tomorrow you can do it! I’ve been a mess lately. Everything has just dumped on me lately. The realization of another year’s passing while I remain stagnant has compounded on a host of other issues I’ve been having lately. All that on top of a longer period of depression I’ve been experiencing since around September or October. Tomorrow is all about me. I’ll be spending most of my day in nature (the best medicine imo) hiking and doing some landscape photography. I already dread getting out the door to do it, but once I’m out there I’ll be happy I made it. We can do it!"
2185,Is getting a tattoo a good thing to do to distract yourself?,"I now just permanently parted ways with the girl who I was in a relationship for a year and a few months. This has really let me hit rock bottom. Is getting my first tattoo a good way to distract me from her? I can’t stop thinking about her so much that it affects my work, it keeps me up late at night and it makes me want to do something to myself."
2186,I'm finding it harder and harder to want to continue living.,"I'm a 19-year-old male with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and attention deficit disorder. I've been wanting to end my for a long time, but I'm too much of a lazy coward to do anything about it. I have no skills, barely any money, an awful education that's getting me nowhere, not a single ounce of love in my life, and the list goes on for a long while.

I greatly need help, but I just can't get it anymore. I'd love it if somebody would like to chat with me, because being alone is absolutely the worst thing for me. I just don't know how to go on with my life anymore. I just need like an intervention or something, because I can't help myself. I need somebody to be there with me, but I don't have anybody."
2187,"It’s not that I don’t have a reason to live, it’s that I’m tired.","Things have gotten better for me over the years, materially speaking. But the loneliness never goes away. I’m tired. The sadness never goes away either, even on my best days.

I’m tired of people telling me to get help. I’ve tried it, hasn’t worked for me. Eating healthy, exercising, social media purges, working on passion projects, talking to professionals. Nothing works. I’ve accepted that there’s something innately wrong with me. Bad wiring, I guess."
2188,I don't want to wear sunglasses anymore,"TLDR: very sad, do drugs, don't eat, kill the rich, don't trust people, let teeth rot, shit year, try again 2020.

this is a vent post because I am likely not going to the doctors until the new year (unless I do something stupid or it gets worse which is pretty fucking likely tbh but I try to be optimistic because I guess that's all I can do)

sorry4badenglish, thoughts are a bit chaotic and structure is not my forte. left out stuff but hey this will do. peace.

Before I started this year I was 90% sure I was depressed, the other 10% accounting for the fact that I might have tricked myself into believing something that isn't true (something that is not unfamiliar to me). Now I am 110% sure.

tried trusting people this year after years of being a distant nonperson, and all it got me was a broken laptop and legal threats due to rent arrears I wasn't responsible for too  (I allowed myself to be naive, thinking that people are inherently good and don't want to hurt one another).

I had a breakdown earlier this year at the end of July, in reaction to the betrayal of one of my previous housemates (who sent the entire sum of the rent money to his child support instead of to the landlord resulting in us getting evicted) and the overwhelming hostility of estate agents and other bill collectors who want money that I am unable to produce (and they know this but yet they treat you like a criminal regardless).

I started crying at work and couldn't think properly, thoughts were racing and I felt like I wasn't in control. I haven't felt like this in a while, but I could feel myself losing control. I told my boss that I had to leave and that I was too stressed/depressed to function as I felt like I was going to quit my job on the pot and that would only fuck me up more and was the worst thing to do. I left and ghosted my work for the next week.

During this week I almost went to the hospital, this is big because I don't really recall a time in my life where I have been to the hospital for a general checkup as my parents are pro homeopathy/anti pumping your body full of drugs. every time I suggest that I go to the hospital because I think I have a problem (have mentioned my heart before but it has been written off has likely indigestion) they say don't go because whatever problem you have they will prescribe you drugs and there are alternative solutions than drugs. 

Anyway I digress, I almost went to the hospital ready to confess all the reasons why I think that I am depressed and check out the myriad of physical health problems that I also possibly have, but didn't manage to find the energy to fill in the appropriate form (and didn't have 2 forms of proof of address) so just didn't.

since then I think I have been having a depressive episode, I say think because I haven't had a diagnosis but regardless, everything went dark here.

I started showing up late to work more, I started smoking more weed to deal with the increased amount of stress in my life. I started doing more risky things (i.e things at work which could get me in trouble/doing MDMA whilst knowing that my heart doesn't feel as healthy as it should be), but I didn't break down again after this. I just kept going, because if I let myself lose control again it would all be over. game over. can't lose job can't lose house not allowed to not have money.

actually got through the house situation and managed to find a new place to live, but since then I have pretty much ceased putting all effort into my life.

Over the last 2 months I have:

\- Stopped cooking for myself, all I do I eat crisps and chicken slices from the corner shop everyday, I know this is unhealthy. I am unsure if I am doing this deliberately in order to harm myself or if I just don't have the energy. regardless I know it is significant because I have dropped from 72kg to 66.5kg from this new 'diet'.

\- I have gave up on my New Years resolution to stop drinking energy drinks, now drinking 2 a day (one before work, and one in my break) to make my work day as easy as possible. the reason I stopped in the first place was because I felt it was negatively affecting my heart and I still believe this to be true but don't really care anymore.

\- Continued increased substance abuse, primarily smoking lots of weed to stop me from feeling negative thoughts and help me get to sleep easier, but have also had increased alcohol use, alongside some MDMA, and Cocaine (which I wasn't even planning on trying but did it on a whim, which is very like me I guess but not necessarily the controlled decision I would like myself to have)

\- Stopped brushing my teeth (brushed them under 10 times in last 2 months)

\- started stealing from the company I work for, not for profit, but instead to spite the company and to distract myself from my negative thoughts  by focusing on how/what I am going to steal . 

\- intentionally relapsed into an older financial addiction in order to cripple myself for December.

\- complete neglect of living situation cleanliness, not quite neckbeardnest level but close

\- I am a passenger in my life, just watching it happen, not putting any effort in beyond the bare minimum.

\- ALL THOUGHTS ARE NEGATIVE, ALWAYS ANGRY ALWAYS SAD NEVER FREE

Lmao are you still reading? 

I have spent the last 6 months pondering whether I should kill people or not.

at first I think I wanted to kill people (not anyone specific just killing for the sake of killing) because I felt as though I wasn't in control of my life and I wanted to be heard. and you can't really ignore someone who kills someone. but that's a stupid thought, would just end up looking like some crazy fuck and get thrown in prison. I wouldn't allow this to happen, I would kill myself before allowing myself to be locked up for the rest of my life. so maybe this wasn't about regaining control but rather me contemplating committing an action that would push me towards ending my life. I have tried to end my life before, with copious amounts of alcohol and a walk down the motorway, but ultimately decided that I am young and owe it to myself to at least let myself try in life before I decide to end it prematurely.

on the same subject with the uk general election coming up (and now gone, fuck the Torys) , I am hateful of our government and large corporations exploiting so many people. why is it ok that some people are earning £15k a year after taxes and some people are earning £800k a year. these people are evil. if you put me in a room with someone who harms more people than the benefit they bring to this world, then I reckon I could kill them only feeling but a modicum of guilt. there are bad people, they have lots of money and this keeps them in control, people have been fighting against this inequality for years. the only way to stop them is violence. democracy doesn't exist.

I don't want to kill people nor am I currently anywhere near doing it (don't have a plan, the internet says plans make it serious), I just don't think killing people as black and white good or bad we are made to believe.

I work alongside someone with a net worth of £400m, I disagree with his existence entirely but yet I have not had a plans to be violent towards him. I respect him as a person and would like to talk to him about why I think this way and his view on this. I isolate myself a lot and sometimes get into thought bubbles, talking to people who think differently from me helps get a more realistic view of situations. but I don't think this will change my opinions.

I want a peaceful future but I do not think I am getting it. violent protest is the only way to stop the rich.

seeing people in their 60s working the same shit job as me is the opposite of hope, even if I do have a successful life will I really be happy if so many people are not.

I don't know man, I am on edge. I don't want to destroy my life but a feel myself losing control more and more. I just want to drop out of society and lay down to die. I am hard playing against myself at the moment. but hey at least I'm still showering. 

I don't want to live in a world that is so hostile and unfriendly towards its people over money, it disgusts me and I want it to change and if it that is ultimately futile I will leave this world and put my trust in whatever alternative death may bring.

In the new year I hope I find the courage to go the doctors, before I harm myself anymore. I think a diagnosis will help me to assess how I am going to progress with my life and remove at least some of the uncertainty I have about the future

but for now fuck it all, gonna keep floating and try to not to die, because that's what life about right? hahaha..."
2189,7 trash bags,"In an attempt to pull myself out of my depression i cleaned my room up a bit. I have a vary bad habit of just throwing my trash on the ground by my bed when im in this state of mind and i never have the energy/motivation to pick up except for once in a while.
Today was 7 trash bags of trash. I feel (and am) disgusting."
2190,No type,"Why am I nobody’s type?
Why can’t I have the perfect body? When any guy talks about there type why don’t I fit the description?  I’m tall and skinny but I don’t have a flat stomach. I’m not “thick” and my face is average. My hips are kinda wide, my rib cage shows and that grossed out most people. My personality is average but someone else always has a better one. 
All my friends have guys all over them and I can’t get one. 
Why am I nobody’s type?"
2191,First post on reddit ever,"Hey

Just wanted to talk about what I’ve been going through recently because I read through a lot of posts on here and thought talking to you guys might help me a bit

I started college this year as a freshman and was really excited at first, I was entering a new phase in my life and it was exciting. I’d been depressed over the summer and had recently broken up with my first girlfriend about two weeks before college started so I couldnt wait to be out of my house and make new friends.

I am rooming with two long time friends and the first three weeks were great, kept my mind off the break up and was making new friends. But quickly my mental health just plummeted. I found myself getting really angry at my roommates and friends and felt like I was a bit bipolar as my mood would go from good to bad back to good constantly throughout the day. I was also seeing a massive decline in my self esteem, which has always been low ( I don’t think very highly of myself) but I started shit talking myself in my head. I started telling myself I was boring, unfunny, stupid, a nuisance, told myself I was ugly, and even convinced myself my friends hated me. As time went on it only got worse and my emotions were all over the place. I’d cry in my room and then 5 minutes later be out laughing. For the past month or so though I stopped feeling happy. No more mood changes. Nothing. Just unhappiness and it’s really started to wear on me.

I’m still able to hang out with friends but it just feels forced. I feel like I have to be there and fake a smile, participate in conversation I really dont care about. I’ve lost interest in a lot of things I enjoy doing and I’ve just become numb. It hasn’t affected my work though, one of the few things I pride myself on is my work ethic, but it has affected my grades. I’m struggling to maintain a 3.0 gpa and get the hope scholarship which pays for 80% of my tuition and this has only made things worse. I feel extreme guilt for being lazy and avoiding school work until the last minute and getting shitty grades but I just can’t force myself to care about it anymore. Eating has become a challenge too, I eat 1-2 meals a day and have lost about 10 pounds and I’m already skinny as shit.

Life has really just become a drag and I feel empty inside, I have no real ambition to do much of anything and I don’t see myself going anywhere. I just see myself as a burden to my friends and family. I’ve been losing contact with a lot of my friends and I’m scared I’m just going to end up alone by next year.

It’s also very hard for me to make friends on my own, I have really bad social anxiety and I don’t really meet anyone new unless I’m with my close friends, it gives me comfort and helps me feel comfortable socializing with new people."
2192,Tired &amp; Broken,"Last night, I told me husband how I feel like I cant go on anymore. I'm just so tired and feel like I'm at the end of my rope. He cried and it broke me even more. I don't want to hurt him but I'm just so lost. I feel so broken and defeated but I dont want to hurt my husband."
2193,I haven't slept in my bed or cleaned my room in over a month.,"I recently got dumped by my long running GF who was my first serious relationship. She was the only girl I've ever been seduced and in love with. She was my first experience for everything.
She had a baby daughter and I loved the two of them more than anything and tried to give them the world, spending every dollar, every hour and every night I could with them. 
I gave her a promise ring and offered to buy us a place, and echoed her constant mention of marriage and kids saying I want to make a real proposal with those things to follow soon. She said yes. Then I found out she had been cheating. She left me for him after I found out. 

I've also since realized that she was always just as horrible and untrustworthy from the start. Always abusive and manipulative, making me change from ""how could I have made her stay"" to ""how can I be such a worthless piece of s**t."" I can't feel good about myself or keep a smile long for many reasons, including feeling like I'm not ever gonna get better because I bring these things to myself. 

I haven't been able to keep any consistency or good thoughts long since. I've not slept in my own bed once, my room now looks like an episode of hoarders, I either don't eat or sleep at all for days, or I eat just enough and sleep all day feeling like shit the whole night and the morning after, wanting to sleep the pain away. Everytime I decide to try and clean my room I immediately lose the motivation to. 

I feel like I'm living a shell of my life and would rather continue than find my strength. 


Tl;dr. Gf cheated, left with her daughter I'm attached to and took care of for a long time, went from blaming myself for her leaving to blaming myself for not seeing she was always abusive and I'll never be happy."
2194,Does anyone else lose words mid sentence?,"Lately I have been having a hard time with memory in general, but more annoyingly i have been having a hard time talking. 

For example today I was talking to a friend about my new to me cast iron pan. Even though I had just said the word cast iron earlier in the sentence, and we were talking about it, and the object was within sight, it took me so long to remember the words. 

This has been happening a lot lately and I don't understand why. I have always had a hard time keeping my mind on track with what im saying, but it has been so much worse now. I got used to saying to friends/therapists that if i pause for a long time I am just trying to remember where I was going with a thought or a word. I just need a moment to remember. (I get interrupted a lot because of the pauses). But now rather than it be like 5-10 seconds, its been 15-30+. I am starting to feel embarassed about it. 

Its worse when I am in a loud place or where there is a lot of movement. I honestly get so easily pulled away from my words that I can't make eye contact when im speaking. I get distracted by eye color, their eyebrows, their expression, wrinkles, anything honestly."
2195,First Post,"I think I was diagnosed with depression several years ago but I was too chicken shit to read the diagnosis. I was prescribed Lexapro and Adderall but stopped taking them as they were making me feel  worse. 
I had a history of smoking a ton of pot and drinking which is what lead to the prescription and to a diagnosis. This was all in 2011 when I started my college career. 8 years later I’m still in school and not feeling better. I feel like is holding me back from living at my best and that the debt I got into was not worth it because the work I want to do is not related tonight degree. Classes are redundant and I am no longer learning anything. Don’t think getting into more debt is the answer.
I guess I was posting because I was hoping to hear some thoughts leaving school for alternative schooling. Feeling lost is all"
2196,Am I a fool? (long story no tldr),"I've struggled with depression from the tender age of 11.  I have fragmented memories of sexual abuse, parents who made me feel worthless, and eventually my first girlfriend betrayed me.

It was junior high,we kept our relationship a secret, little did I know she was also dating another girl in our friend group at the same time. Even went as far to have us both over at the same time on multiple occasions.  We both confided in each other that we were dating the same girl.  Well, I was the one not good enough, so she continued dating the other girl then later in our adult life, became best friends with my friend. Ugh.

I attempted suicide after this.  My step parents were awful they called me fat, annoying. Looking back I wasn't really that fat but I wasn't skinny either.  They would buy food for their kids and make me feel bad if I ate any. Like, do you really need to have a slice of birthday  cake.  This led me to hoard non perishable food in case I got hungry and didn't want to deal with their judgy eyes. Did they really need to treat me like this?  I grabbed every pill I could find and took them. I did not realize how sick I was going to get.  I puked and puked til there was nothing left.  I don't remember much other than the puking and taping out asking my friend to take me to the Er. When I came home after a stay at the stabilization unit. I told them it was because of my ex gf, I didn't want things to be harder for me. 

I eventually met my now husband in high school.  We grew together but also ensured shit together.  How naive to think that watching porn was cheating, I was so insecure, I only found out when my credit card was charged

Then it was the emails and dating sites. Each incident ending in a fight, where yes, he did mess up, but I needed to be stronger emotionally. At this point I had not been on any medication. He could not cope thinking it was his fault I wasn't happy. 

He eventually had to work up north a week at a time. When he came back he would be home while I worked because not everyone can work a week at a time.  We got into one of our rare fights where I told him he needed to stay and he threw me to the ground and left.

Fast forward to five years ago. We have been through all this through 10 years, want sure we would ever get married at this point. But we continued on.

His birthday came around and we had a threesome with a friend and he took it too far and came in her.  I wondered how stupid he could be that it took us years to get to that point that he does this with her?  I would think he could at least finish with me.
I left and cried.  I wanted to die, but I let this happen. We ended up breaking up. I was so depressed I lost my sense of taste. I spent Christmas alone. When we were on the mend I found that my ex best friend was hanging around him.  I thought okay she has a boyfriend and i moved the town over that it was unfair of me to try and deny him comfort.  One night he told me he would call me when he got home but I never received a call. It had been snowing and I feared he had been involved in an accident. I called and called with no answer. Later that week I found that this friend of mine had slept over that night and she was telling him not to go back to me.

He says it was when he got too drunk he couldn't sleep and then fixed the curtain rod that she started seeing him as a better partner than her current bf, which she did end up leaving in the end.  She knew he was handy, dad material, good job, sweet, ect. And started flirting with him soon after he fixed the curtains.

I was devastated. While I had worried about him, he was banging my ex friend. Why did I let this keep happening. Why did I want to go back to him.
Did he help develop this anxiety.

It seemed the moment i let my guard down, my heart took another hit.

It wasn't until I accidentally came across an email where he wanted to pay for sex. It never went further than that one email. I've had it. I told him he needed help and he was going to therapy or I was done.

Therapy taught him how to cope. And we were happy. We finally got married, we even have a healthy baby together. Things are good. My life is so whole now. 

I was blind sided when I heard this girls name at dinner. My SIL mentioned their wedding and how unique it was and I started crying.  I couldnt help it.  My eyes welled up at the dinner table while all those feelings came and slapped me in the face. While I'm living my best life.  After a childhood of dreaming of a family dinner, I'm now eating that dinner with my family and I'm sitting there stifling back my tears because I had let my guard down. I feel so much trust for my now family that I was reminded it is too good to be true, right?

My husband realized I had not properly dealt with this and offered to talk. I was so angry at the person he was before therapy but I feel so u justified to be angry because it is all in the past.

I'm hurt, I'm scared, and I want to be stronger because I also have a new baby that needs me to be at my best. He's been really understanding of my feelings as he's going through an illness of his own and he is starting to realize how much I really care for him and he promises I won't have to go through any of that again.  

I doubt anyone has cared to read this far but I need an outlet.
I hope I'm not a fool in this."
2198,thoughts. hurting ones.,what if the negative thoughts were true? what can I do? they said keep the negative talk away but when it comes it almost felt like it's the reality.
2199,Can love but do not feel loved??,"Hi! So I have always been a super intense and loving partner in relationships. But I always seem to run into this problem of not feeling loved enough. It’s like I can pour all my love onto my significant other and they can do the same for me in a way that definitely speaks to my love language and such, but I just don’t feel loved. It’s incredibly frustrating. I love my bf so so so much, but me not being able to let his love in is driving me crazy. I am currently in therapy and on meds. How do I work towards making this better?

Side note: My parents (especially my dad) were emotionally abusive towards me. I was loved immensely by them but also screamed at a lot by my dad to the point where I was crying so hard that I would start hyperventilating. This would happen on a consistent basis. Even me asking a “why” type of question would get him going- I was in no way a bratty child.  

tl;dr I love but do not feel loved in relationships that are definitely adequate enough. I am on meds and in therapy. The emotional abuse I suffered as a child most likely led to me not feeling loved and hating myself. How do I work to bettering this and letting love in?"
2201,Having a depression episode in the middle of my trip...,"Hey everyone...
Hope you guys are doing well...

As the title suggests, i am having a depression episode.
I'm on a college trip, and i was sure this trip was going to be memorable. Its turning out to be quite the contrary...

It started on day 1 when i forgot my ID and had to rush home to get it, 10 mins before departure...
Second day, i broke my glasses.
Day three, our trip organisation is a mess. We're just going from hotel to hotel. Not staying anywhere and not being able to enjoy the scenery. 
We haven't visited any temple, or any tourist attraction. Or anything worth remembering either... 

Yesterday was just a complete mess. Had to deal with multiple problems and had a slight panic which was induced by my bestie..

And in the morning today, i lost my wallet...

So ya... My depression period is literally triggering after staying dormant for quite a while.
I'm literally close to crying... After years and years worth of being welled up...

So ya..."
2202,Hatred,"I hate me.
I hate my body.
I hate my face. 
I hate my personality.
I hate my life. 
I hate me. 
I want to disappear.
Do you think someone would notice? 
Do you think someone would care?
Do you think someone would try and find me? 
I want to disappear.
Am I wanted?
Am I need?
Am I cared for? 
Am I important?
Am I wanted?
I hate me.
I want to disappear.
Am I wanted?"
2203,Really want to just talk to someone,"All of my friends have been abandoning me because I'm too much to handle. I feel like I can't trust anyone to actually be a shoulder for me to lean on and all I want to do is talk to someone, be able to trust someone. And its compounding. The more that people leave the harder it is to not be insufferable when someone actually decides to stick around, until they inevitably start to leave me on read and give two word answers and decline my attempts at hanging out. Again and again. Endless relentless cycle."
2204,Happiness is not a fucking choice,Every time I feel like shit I’m spoonfed this happy go lucky shit. Every time I feel like this my moms mad at me for putting her in a bad mood. Now it’s 12:30 and it’s not like sleep is worth it to go through the nightmares. To hell with it all I want to politically identify as a anarchist at this point.
2205,Depressed about the way my life is headed. Wish I could be happy while toiling to escape,"I haven’t felt real happiness, belonging, and sense of purpose for about a year. I’m a 21 year old student and college is just a backup. I’ve wanted to be my own boss since I was 14 and had my first business till a year ago. When I lost it I made the realization that if I don’t make this new thing work with the potential it has - I’ll be working for someone else the rest of my life with 3 weeks vacation being something I don’t want to be then I’ll die. I envy people who just want a regular time but it’s not who I am.

I had a new business idea a year ago but it’s not working yet and it’s really been a struggle for me. I’m working so hard and coming to the realization I still might fail. I’m miserable and overworked but I just need to keep going. I wish I could find some more balance but I don’t know how given school and Plan A take so much of my energy. It isn’t sustainable long term but I hope I make it out of the tunnel before I go nuts and kill myself."
2206,"Lonely, can't sleep, miss holding ex and her daughter, what do I do?","I recently came out of a long, serious relationship. Had a long time GF and her daughter I called my own that I'd hold every night in my arms. We split and now I can't stand being by myself at night. I try to hold pillows and force thoughts of holding someone, child or lover, close again. I'm planning on getting a weighted blanket, but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or ideas on nightly comforts or anxiety/depression reducing things? I've always struggled with feeling touch or like I'm loved or like I have someone to hold close and make them feel loved and safe, and now I struggle not having a child to provide that safety and warmth to."
2207,Just want notifications,"Nothing is happening in my life and i just broke up with my girlfriend. Used to wake up to 'i love you' s and now i get nothing at all . Not from friends , not from anyone . Its god damn empty and sad . All i want is you to comment whatever you want ."
2209,How do you stop thinking about something that hurts,A really upsetting situation happened in my relationship and I want to try and work around it but my brain just keeps going round and round on the problem like torturing myself. Any ideas on how to stop thinking about something traumatic and start to heal from it? I havent slept at all and its 530am and I'm just smoking weed again to try and deal with the problem which is only going to make it worse once I come down or wake up tomorrow morning
2210,Negativity,"Everything is so negative now, why does everything have to be shit? I used to be interested in politics but it seems now like a big game of who’s throat to jump down next. I used to like people but they really fuckin suck now, everyone is so involved in themselves they don’t see anyone around them. Parents don’t pay attention to their kids, just ignore every action and noise. the world feels numb, disconnected. I have friends and family that love me but I feel so far away from them. My doctor said to exercise more to improve mood but it doesn’t help. I can’t sleep and when I do I don’t want to wake up. I don’t know where I am or what’s going on and everyone seems so content with being in a happy bubble. I’m not happy or sad or angry, I’m just not here anymore, so far away from people that I can see but can’t see me. I’m mad at myself for feeling this way, people care, and I care about them but it’s this weird fuckin feeling that I haven’t had before. I don’t know how to explain it but it feels like a weight. I feel heavy and slow and distanced. I feel like shit but don’t want anyone near me. I need help but no one can help me. 

does anyone feel this way?"
2211,First time going to a doctor.,"If I make an appointment with a doctor, can I tell them I have no interest of seeing a psychologist? I just want to see a psychiatrist for the meds. I don’t want to talk to anybody about anything. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts and severe social anxiety for twelve years now. I just want the strongest thing they can give me so I feel no pain."
2212,I cry myself to sleep tonight. I’m not making it to 2020.,
2213,Why do I even give a fuck,"Everything I feel is temporary. Mother dead? oh yeah, you're allowed to be sad for like a week, and then it can go over here in the corner and fade away. Dad abusive? mhm, yes, ok, you can be mad at him for a day, but then it can go over here, and oops! it's gone. What am I to do? feelings of intense depression? yeah, sorry, you're not allowed to work through or feel that, no, not allowed, it's just gonna go over there.. oh yeah, what feelings again? Identity crisis? ok, I'll let you have that one until you're just starting to figure things out, and then poof! back to square one. Sorry, it's the rules :) I'm not allowed to feel apparently. It all just fades into the mush and sits there like a pressure against my head. All that remains is anxiety and a whole load of nothing. I live in a fog world, left uncomfortably numb by whatever this is. I don't know why I even try, nothing comes of anything, I'm too lost to be productive. One day, there will be nothing left of me. I'm looking forward to it."
2214,How do I get myself to go to therapy?,"Hi guys, I told my parents (I'm a teenager) about me feeling really bad and said that I wanted to go to therapy. They weren't entirely supportive but agreed. However, their English isn't great so I have to make the appointment myself and I just.... I don't want to. I guess I don't want to go to therapy because I've been so depressed for so long and I kind of like it. Being sad makes me feel safe. I know that's bad but I don't know how to change my mindset and make the goddamned appointment."
2215,I have never treated,"If I make an appointment with a doctor, can I tell them I have no interest of seeing a psychologist? I just want to see a psychiatrist for the meds. I don’t want to talk to anybody about anything."
2216,Do you want a ride? Did you take your meds? Every morning and every night,"Everyday I ask the boy I like if he wants a ride to school, everyday he says yes, every night I remind him to take his meds, he says ""yes ma'am"", everyday after work I drive around with him and my other friend, every night we have a great time
Every night I feel more attached 
Every night I hate myself more for knowing he would never like me back and I'm just hurting myself more 
Every morning I hate myself for knowing that I'll never tell him how I feel"
2217,A little story,"Today, I did something terrifying. For the past month, I’ve been hooking up with my ex, and never really got over her. In the moment it felt good, but looking back it made my depression much worse. I had this feeling like, ""well no one will ever want me sexually again, so take the chance now before it’s gone forever."" 

I don’t know what changed, but this morning I had an epiphany. Even though my mind is constantly telling me I don’t deserve better, like I’m sure many people here can relate to, it’s just not true. Our minds make us think that this is all there is to our lives, being sad, lonely, suicidal and depressed. Tell us we're stuck in this place and we will be for the rest of our lives but it just doesn’t have to be that way.

It’s funny, even writing this that little voice in my head is saying that idea is stupid. It’s saying I messed up by breaking it off, because now I’ll be alone forever. I’m sure your minds are saying similar things to you, perhaps about vastly different situations and problems, but the same sentiment is still there.

I just want to let you know that even when we convince ourselves otherwise, we do deserve better. We deserve happiness and fulfillment even if  we don’t see it all the time. If anyone here would like someone to talk about their problems with, my PM's are always open. I hope this made sense, and I hope you all know that even if you don’t believe in yourself, I believe in you. 

We can do this, guys."
2218,Anyone?,"Hi reddit, it's been a rough day? week? Month? Honestly I'm not sure anymore, I'm just sure I feel like a waste, like of space, of potential, of time, and like in general. 
This last couple days have been rough, my roommate left for the holidays and I didn't realize how much it helped to mask the feeling of loneliness I have. Actually that's the reason why I'm posting, Im a mess, and thought maybe writing would help me. Right now I'm thinking it could be good if I just don't wake up, like it's the only time I'm completely fine. It's not like I've been going to uni anyways. I just stay in bed doing nothing, I can't find the motivation to do what I should, and even when I do I feel like I'm wasting my time. Honestly I'm not completely sure why I'm writing here, maybe I want advice, maybe just talk with someone that gets it or that could tell what it's wrong, probably nether considering I doubt anyone will read this."
2219,I need help or advice,I have one friend that I text or FaceTime every now and then and that’s it. I try to put myself out there and put on a happy face but no one wants to hang out with me or be friends. People put me down or are negative towards me but they don’t hate me. I also have my Nana who is a few months away from death due to cancer. My nephew had cancer but now it might be in his lung. My dad might have cancer in his bladder or kidneys and my youngest brother is mentally insane and my older brother died almost 3 years ago now.I don’t really look forward to anything anymore and I just feel hopeless. I
2222,I DONT WANT TO FUCKING DO THIS SHIT ANYMORE,omg i really cant do this. I’m so fucking tired of crying dude i just cant. My god please i dont wanna cry anymore please i fuckinghate myself
2223,My life just fucking sucks,I have nothing and I’m just stuck in the box. I’ll never live up to what I’ve wanted to be. I just wish something would happen to me so I don’t have to live anymore.
2224,My dating history,Just need to voice this and I dont know where else to do this except here. I am still deeply hurting over my ex and I really dont know why I should be she was literally the worst gf I have ever had although all my exes were similar such as being from single mother households 2 out of 3 were only childs all 3 were sexual abuse victims and had daddy issues now I'm not saying dont date people like that I'm just wondering why I always end up with girls like that I'd like to try dating a different type of woman like from a two parent household but I'm feeling like I could never attract the type and that I'm missing out on a potential mate that's a great fit I have to work on myself romantically speaking but I probably won't get the relationship I want so why fucking try anymore should I give up or not fuck it
2225,i’m so fucking lonely,"i feel so purposeless in my life right now and i don’t know what to do about it. i feel so invaluable at my job. my work schedule is so irregular and i get so much anxiety thinking about when i might get called in to work without notice. i can hardly plan anything because i’m always expecting to get called in last minute. 

my breakup keeps getting brought back to the surface after i feel like i’m done with it. i’ve gotten closure but now i feel like something will just keep happening and i’ll have to deal with it all over again. 

i’m literally in the worst shape of my life and i have no motivation to use my body for anything besides eating and sleeping and jacking off. my eyes constantly feel tired and swollen and like they’re sinking into my skull. i get fucking emotional randomly for like 5 seconds and then feel numb immediately afterward.

i’m so lonely and desperate for someone to tell me things are going to be okay."
2227,Just wanted to share it,"I can't stay alone with my thoughts. It's like I want to see myself suffer. Every day i think about things that makes me angry and depressed. Even when i try to think about other things, it doesn't work, I can't stop these thoughts, unless i think about death or ways of killing myself. I would love to die right now, but sadly it doesn't work that way. And there are to many people around me, so killing myself would be wrong. For the last 4 years i can hardly find energy to do something productive and make any impact on my ""life"". Why everything must be so complicated. I don't know how long can i go through this, sometimes it's just to much to handle."
2228,Im so lonely,"Yes i know that everybody on this subreddit has made a post about being lonely but i just want to get this off my back.

I've been so loneny for the past 2 years.
All my friends are gone. Two of them moved out the neighborhood without telling, another one became a peice of shit just coming to my house to play fortnite on my computer ( im not kidding that actually happened and every time i tell him that my pc is broken he just... leaves) and the other just disappeard.
 
In my school nobody talks to me im the ""lonely one""

I tried to make new friends but nobody seems to like me."
2229,I'm not suicidal or anything but I would accept my death under any circumstances,"To be honest, I wouldn't mind if I die. Getting robbed/kidnapped and killed or getting hit by a car accidentally, I really don't care if this happened to me. I'm not like suicidal or something, but if I'm going to die, that's fine for me."
2230,Anyone else that doesn’t care about making close friends or relationships?,"I moved in my junior year of high school and never really made any close friends. It’s no surprise that after high school ended, we haven’t talked at all. 

I started college this year and it really struck me how hard it is to develop close friends and relationships. I don’t think my body and mind and willing to put in the time and effort it takes. I’ve been isolated from a whole. The only social interaction I get is at work and college with coworkers, classmates and customers. Aside from that, I’m always home. 

I think my body is getting used to the isolation and my motivation to make friends is sinking. I feel completely okay being alone every day, every hour. 

Anyone feel the same?"
2231,I need to be loved,"I cant go without having someone, I need to be loved, I cant handle break ups at all Im so obsessive Im such a mess Im going to shit"
2232,I keep having panic attacks about my biology final Tuesday,"I'm so scared for Tuesday,  I keep having panic attacks.  I have to get a 50 out of 60 to pass the class and I have 0 clue how the hell to do this.... i hate this!"
2233,I’m getting too comfortable being alone,I’m starting to severely isolate myself. I tell myself that others don’t want to hangout with me. I feel like I’ll inevitably end up embarrassing myself. I sometimes go days without speaking to anyone. The only person I hang out with is my roommate and he’s gone 4 days out of the week. I desperately want to move out of my hometown but I’m afraid. I don’t know how to better my life because I’m always afraid I’ll fail/be just as unhappy elsewhere. I just don’t know if this is depression of if there’s something more serious going on. I feel very lazy and I just don’t really have any motivation to make changes even though I know I need to change.
2234,How do you live life as being an awkward person?,"Literally everything I do is awkward, my arm placement, the way I talk, the way people look at me, basically everything is awakward for me. How do I live life like this? I wish I had more friends, but it's such a pain in the ass when your awkward."
2235,My mental health roller coaster,"Life if messed up it sucks being alive I have been bullied at a young age. My friend bullied me in 2ed grade and I guess from that I grew self esteem issues. I moved to a new school and had no friends and I kinda enjoyed being alone I’m the oldest one out of the kids in my family so I was use to being alone, anyways I did met two friends in 3ed grade in Girl Scouts. (they are still my friends today) However I didn’t have any friends at school until 4th grade I ended up liking him and when I told him and when he said he didn’t like me in that way I was broken to the point I stoped talking to him. In 5th grade my mom started fighting with her boyfriend every night for hours I couldn’t sleep my mental health got worse from there I started wanting to cut and I started to cry so much to the point i couldn’t cry anymore and I started to hid my feelings I made myself go numb to the point where I couldn’t feel anything. 6th grade was fine except I didn’t do my work my mom had stoped fighting with her boyfriend and I started to make friends my mental health kept on getting worse tho I couldn’t Bring Myself to do work. I’m 7th grade I stoped eating and fainted which made me see thing and have a really bad memories I kept on getting worse I made new friends and I started having mental outbursts oh I got a boyfriend In 8th grade my mental health and self-esteem went way down after my boyfriend started wanted to have sex all the time and was always busy I started to cut and when he found that I wanted to do more cutting he left me he was everything to me at the time. After that I started wanting to die it was hard to go to school I didn’t want to be seen everyone knew because he told everyone. I was bullied/picked on more and one kid threaten to beat me up I wanted to die but at the same time I didn’t i started to have dreams about people killing themselves and became scared of dieing but still wanted to die I talked to the school counselor asking if I could get counseling they said they would ask my mom but it’s been 2 months and I didn’t hear back my mental health is getting worse I started drinking mouthwash to make me drunk gagging as I drinked it I want to stop eating again....I just want to be happy I’m sorry if this short story of my mental health sucked but I just can’t bring myself to do much writing this is helping me I like talking to people about my problems it makes me feel better and I want mental help I don’t have energy to edit this so just read it however you want :) I try to make sure that I’m positive and happy but it’s hard when you just want to cry and when you feel like your drowning and your memory is getting worse and worse thank you for reading this and please I don’t know what to do about my mental health."
2236,anyone else here with chronic depression think that romantic relationships are futile or not worth the trouble at the expense of mental health?,"my background:
have had depression since my very early teen years, perhaps even as young as 11.

started getting treated at 23 via counselling and ssris. have ptsd from a traumatic event in my life at 22, i still have vivid nightmares almost daily and am afraid to fall asleep. had social anxiety from 2011-2016 due to ptsd which now has significantly subsided and i just have the run of the mill general anxiety.

in 2017, my partner of 7 years and fiancé for 2, abruptly left me 3 weeks before our wedding. he said the cause was that i was leaning too much on him (i’d argue he was equally if not more reliant on me).

i took this break up very bad. every bit of progress i had made since 2016 just dissolved and i was in much worse shape than ever.

i then met my most recent ex almost a year later and we were together for a year and a half. i told him quite early on i constantly have suicide ideation, had attempted many times in the past and recent and that i had ptsd and severe major depression. he didn’t seemed phased. but worried about displaying my depression, i mostly hid it from him. the only thing i was open about was when i was discontinuing a drug that i didn’t want to be put on anymore. i had migraines for about 3 months, was very moody. 

recently my family life has deteriorated and it affected my deeply. i began just being distant and cold and a bit of a hot head. i was going through so much turmoil in my mind that i neglected him. then he decided he didn’t want to be with me anymore, and said that i needed to fix myself and that he wanted to date other girls.

i feel very abandoned again, ideating about suicide often again and attempted suicide several times. i am a little better now but i’m so overwhelmed by sadness and sometimes can’t get out of bed.

i try to be more social and have been going out quite a bit. everyone thinks i’m doing really well and i seem fun and happy but really i’m a really good actor and liar. 

several guys have seemed to approach me romantically but i just don’t see the point. at some point my depression is going to get in the way or life will happen and i will be devastated again. i’d rather be alone and safe and enjoy the company of my pets. sure it would nice once in a while to be with someone but i don’t have the heart or energy to be in a full time relationship. i don’t think it’s worth it for all that heart ache, pain, doubt and sliding several steps back into a deeper depression.

does anyone else feel this way? i just don’t think it’s worth the trouble and pain."
2237,Why does no one care about depression?,"Such a serious issue, yet no one cares."
2239,Feeling of emptiness,"I made the decision to separate from you, but did I make the right decision? You're a great girl but together we become toxic. The amount of pain we both sustained in this relationship was just too much, and I genuinely hope you can find someone that can treat you the way you want to be treated. 

Is this what sadness feels like? I just want to be alone, but at the same time I feel so lonely..."
2240,Holiday hell,Is it just me or does anyone else get crippling depression and anxiety when the holidays roll around? I just want to lock myself in a room. How do you push through without self medicating or isolating yourself?
2241,"I want to end this, but Im too nice to do it.","To be honest i don't even know what to say. 

Im gonna start from the beginning. Im really sorry if this sounds confusing.

I haven't been able to cry in 10 years. Im 23 now. I purposely started to bury my emotions when I was 10. I grew up in a big family of 6 kids. My father left us when i was 2 and my stepdad came to our life when i was 11. My mom was never abusive to me or scary but I often had terrifying conflicts happening in our home during our childhood.  I don't know when but i think after I turned 13, they started treating me as I was the oldest in the family. 

From every issue they had was poured on me. Wether it was my mom and stepdad having issues, or my big brother not coming home for the night or babysitting my step brother. Relatives contacted me frequently aswell because my other siblings wouldn't answer them. So I was the guy they turned on to. When my mom often called for help, my older siblings had excuses or my mom didn't count on them because they let her down so many times. Probably most of the times they did it on purpose. 

I started working when I was 13 because my mom saw that I could manage myself and didn't buy any electronics anymore. But bought for everyone else.

 I had to give away my first big pay when I was 15 and celebrating my birthday. My little brother needed a flight ticket from africa. It was 500€.


I didn't work until I was 17 and after a year I had saved 4500€ while doing an school intern and working for 6 months. My mom told me i had to go to africa with her. I had to buy a ticket to africa and had to give away 2000€ so I lost 3000€ in the process. My relatives knew my mom didn't have any money and that I did so they made her ask me. 

So when I came back I realized my racist manager fired me for not coming for my shifts. ( I was on a holiday leave but she altered the dates so she could fire me). So when I came back I got depressed. I turned 18 that year so I moved out. It took me 2 years to get back to work life. But it became worse. 


They saw I could manage myself so they started asking for money. First job I took in 2 years i worked my ass off and paid all my debts and started saving. But when my contract ended, my family took 5000€ from me and I lost my rental house and another 3000€ in the process. 

And it took me another year to get back to work because I started to get anxiety attacks and couldn't go to work everytime I had a shift. Now im working again but the problems are coming back, as if they know im back on my feet. And I don't know what to do. 

It's so hard to say no and walk away. My mom was in the hospital again because of her anxiety issues and high blood pressure, I hate to see her like that. I got 3 older siblings and they are not doing shit. They couldn't even visit her at the hospital that day.

2 of them even went for a 8000€ trip last year and left me to pay for the 5000€ that our family needed. They know Im depressed but it's not a thing in my culture. It's just.. I honestly don't know what to do. 

Everyone sees me as the nice guy and thinks that I can take anything. But honestly it's too hard. I wasn't supposed to act mature since I was 14. But im deep in this shit and I don't know what to do. The money isn't wha bothers me the most. It's the time im wasting. I don' have a clear picture of what I wanna do anymore.

What should I do?"
2242,hello wurld,"im 20 i havent hung out with friends or anyone in over a month. Today I went jogging and spent time making youtube videos which is what i love doing. I feel so alone reddit. Thoughts of suicide have entered my head everyday for a year. I cant escape. 

I quit my job at a fast food place yesterday and walking out of that shit was so satisfying but then I realized i just cut off the last social interaction i had. After i quit i went to the park and drove around in a snow storm and smoked a bunch of weed and i had a good cry. 

ive been crying almost everyday also for a year. tears are running down my face as i type this. 

if i had a bottle of xanax i would take it all and drink to death 

thank you for reading my uplifting post"
2243,I just don't know what to do anymore.,"I'm a 21 year old guy. I go to work, school, and even play soccer that used to take my mind off of everything. I've felt like utter crap for the past 5 years now, and there have been no signs of it going away. I've cut a few times, and have often thought about just ending it all. I have people that treat me like the scum of the Earth at my job, I can't seem to focus in school, and I've been playing like crap in soccer and feel like I'm letting my friends down all the time. I recently had went to the bar and saw this girl that I liked, and we ended up chilling for a while that night. I wanted to get my feelings out, but I hate myself way too much to even tell her. I feel like shit everyday and struggle to get through the day without thinking about ending it all.

I try to put a smile on my face as much as I can, but recently it's just been way too much. I let everyone down in my life, especially myself. I try to be a better person, but I just can't. I really want to talk to someone, but everyone I know would just treat it as a joke. Even my parents yelled at me when I tried to kill myself back in high school. 

I have this inner battle with myself. One half of me says, ""You'll get through this, you just have to keep going"". Then another part of me says, ""It's pointless to keep lying to myself that I'll get better"". 

I just feel useless to everyone I know. Talking about this stuff to people I know will scare them, and drive them away. I build all these thoughts in my head, and now it's just starting to overflow.  That one night with that girl was probably the happiest I have been in years. But I feel like I'm just an inconvenience to everyone, so what's the point to keep going? I'm falling behind on my degree in school, and feel awful that my parents are using their money on a POS like me.

I'm sorry to post such a long and whiny post, but I have no one else to talk to about what goes on in my head."
2244,Do you ever get in moods where you can’t even listen to music because every song reminds you of how unhappy you are?,"It seems like I can’t put my Spotify on shuffle anymore.  Nearly every song brings up some horrible memory or mistake of mine and I can’t shake it.  Even songs I love just remind me of friendships I’ve ruined, bad jobs, a shitty ex, middle school, you name it.

Music used to be my refuge.  I know that’s stereotypical and yada yada, but...  I was a band kid.  Then I was a grunge kid.  I got fucked up in a mosh pit at a concert like four months ago and was black and blue for days afterward and loved every second of it.  Now, I have to just throw on a podcast while I drive so I don’t sit in silence and let the emptiness eat me from inside because I can’t even tolerate the bands that got me through high school."
2246,I just want someone to talk to,"so this is my first ever reddit post. i dont know who else to talk to. i have a boyfriend and a family that i live with but idk i just cant talk to them they dont understand me at all. 
im not sure how people talk on here, so is this a thread or do i write a long post about myself and i read comments about it..help"
2247,i can't do this anymore. no one can help me. im finished,"I'm at risk of failing out of college and certainly will when my finals come in. i will have no where to go but community college and i will be disowned

my antidepressants are just making me more ill. the first one made me nearly kill myself. this one is giving me massive depersonalization and disassociation issues and is getting progressively worse. i will never be better and no antidepressant willl ever work on me

my girlfriend is definitely leaving me soon and she;s my last supporter. i dont care if im alive anymore. my university counselor left me and was completely irresponsible. its like everytime i ask for help im grasping for straws

my brain has left my body. its over. i will never be conscious or happy again and no other person on the internet has apparently felt this way either

goodbye"
2248,Everybody seems so fake,Everyone just pretends to care. They will smile and pretend that everything is perfect in the world. In reality no one gives a shit. If I died no one would even notice.
2249,Working Customer Service This Holiday Season Has Kicked My Depression Into Full Gear.,"Let me preface this by saying that not all customers are bad. The vast majority have been very kind to me over the past few weeks. It's just *those* people, you know the one's Im talking about, that have been driving me crazy. 

I'm a cashier in a grocery store and it's been packed on weekends as of late. Because of this, customers often have to wait 5-10 minutes in line. (The horror!) This has brought out the worst in some people. 

I take pride in my work. Sure, it's a job pretty much anyone could do, but I still like to do my best. I accidentally put someone's meat at the bottom of their bag today. I blame this on the fact that I'd been standing there doing the same repetitive motion for over five hours like a robot. Also, my lunch break was an hour late so my brain wasn't at it's best. 

This lady could've said, ""Excuse me, but do you think you could rebag this? The meat is on the bottom"" like a nice, decent person, but instead she said this:

""You don't put the meat on the bottom! That's COMMON SENSE!""

Customers rarely make me cry anymore. But this bitch--yes, I'm calling her that because that's what she was--just pushed me past my limit. It wasn't just what she said, but the *way* she said it that upset me. Fortunately, I was able calm and acted nice until she finally left. I held in my tears until I got home then I just burst out crying.

It was just a really shitty day made shittier by this shitty person. I've often wondered if people who treat me like this would change their behavior if they knew how depressed I am. Maybe I'm not even a person to them. I don't know."
2250,Giving Up,"Giving up sucks, it's honestly worse than failing. Although I am a sad person, I see my *personality* as happy. I consider myself a somewhat positive person who sees failure as simply an opportunity to start over. However, when I've officially decided to stop trying something, I become saddened by the fact that I've given up on who I am as a person."
2251,Apathy(?) as a coping mechanism,"Hi there! I'm 19 years old, female, currently in university. 

There are so many things wrong with me. That's how I feel, anyway. 

Just posting this now is a big step for me. 

For a while I've been struggling myself. I know there are things wrong with me, so I try and reach out to people- my family, my friends. Every time, they are so supportive, and I feel better when I talk to them. 

But just when I think that I feel better, I'll spend some time alone. It'll start to feel bad, being alone, because I worry that when I feel okay there won't be that bond between me and my family/friends anymore. So I try to reach out again, talk to them casually, talk about things not involving my sadness. I don't feel satisfied- it seems that they don't like my company that much. I try harder, but I feel worse and worse about myself. Eventually I feel sad again. And alone. 

I feel really sad for some time. But after some time passes, I start to realize something. The thought that I don't matter to anyone eases my anxiety about not being enough for them. Thinking that I don't exist at all, and that they don't care about me at all, makes me feel better. 

I wonder if this is a good coping mechanism or not. 

I wonder if it's okay to feel this way. I'm not hurting anyone. They don't want to be around me anyway. And if I'm content with being alone, too, then everything's okay isn't it? 

Is this okay? To constantly feel like I don't matter to anyone, but be okay with it? To use it as a coping mechanism?

It sounds bad, but I'm truly wondering. Because if it doesn't harm anyone then is there really a problem? 

Is it okay to feel this... apathetic? 

It feels good to reach out and talk to people in the moment. It makes me feel better. But after that I always go back to feeling sad again. I'm worried about becoming dependent on others and feeling sad when no one has the time for me. I'm worried that I can't take care of myself, that I'm not okay by myself and I'll just keep relying on others for comfort. It doesn't seem fair to them either, for me to do that to them. So I wonder if I should just try my best to be apathetic to everything. 

For me, being apathetic is thinking of myself as already dead. That my existence doesn't matter to anyone. It comforts me. I'm just so tired of feeling anxious about not being good enough for others that I think I'd rather believe no one cares for me at all. 

Is this... okay?"
2252,How to find happiness in myself?,"This year has been crazy for me. I quit my job of six years. My girlfriend of 1.5 years dumped me in April. I’ve jumped between 2 jobs and started a new full time position. I decided to try and get another degree in college. I finished this semester and I hated every second of it. I don’t want to go back to school. I have no motivation and I don’t want to spend my free time studying or doing homework. Registration is over. I haven’t told my parents yet. They are going to argue with me. I still live with my parents. I have an associates in art and nearly 17,000 dollars in student loans. I’m not happy in the position I’m in. I’m an anxious person. I get worried very easily and overthink a lot of things. My confidence isn’t good either. Ive been feeling so lost. Not just this year but for a long time.  My ex and i almost got back together in August but I realized it was me putting in all the effort. I decided to give up and work on myself. I haven’t been coping with my depression the best. I’ve drank more this year than in my entire life. Sometimes I think really bad things when I get drunk. It’s not healthy. I mostly go out with friends for fun but most of the time I get completely wasted. Fast forward to November and I started talking to this girl I met on tinder. She’s awesome and we’ve been talking for quite awhile. Unfortunately she moves back to Florida in January. I don’t even know if we are dating. I’m too clingy and needy. I feel like I’m making the same mistakes I did in my last relationship. This girl brings me so much happiness that sometimes I get a bit jealous when she’s talking to other guys. It isn’t good. I get too attached way to quickly. I want to be happy with myself. I want to be happy when I’m alone. I try so hard to please everyone but myself. I don’t find joy in much anymore. That needs to my first priority. I don’t know what to do anymore. My ex messaged me a week ago and apologized for what she did to me. She said she still loved me. Part of me still cares about her. I hate how she waits till I’m seeing someone to apologize. Idk if she even meant it. Then the other half of me hates getting involved with this other girl. When she moves away I’m going to be so sad. I’m too attached for how short of a time I’ve know her. Idk what I’m doing anymore."
2253,Clinical *Song*,"I made this song a while ago but I don't post music anymore because of various reasons, like not getting exposure and just not pursuing it as a career. Still, it would be nice for some people to hear it and see what they thought of it. 

 [https://www.bandlab.com/user7076348989731681/clinical-1ff78c35](https://www.bandlab.com/user7076348989731681/clinical-1ff78c35)"
2254,I have notes I'm looking for some thoughts on,"Tuesday I'm going to my first appointment with my new counselor. I figured I should write down some of my thoughts and views I have when I'm really depressed or more accurately what goes through my head pretty much constantly. I figured I would share these cause why not. These are the 4 I have so far



1.) Finding hobbies and distracting my my mind sounds tiring. Is this what everyone does? Find meaningless shit to because we're too afraid to end it.

2.) I'm the better version of me when I'm drunk. Happier, more interested in things, talkative. When I'm sober I'm boring, less confident, rarely find interest in anything and when I do it's fleeting. 

3.) I sometimes desire a friend or girlfriend but then I remember how alone I feel with others. How annoyed I can get or they depress me. They can remind me of myself and I think of myself and living in general as pathetic so I think they're pathetic and don't wanna be around them. Afterall if someone would want me as a friend a boyfriend then they must be desperate. 

4.) Let's say I do have a girlfriend. It's gonna breakdown overtime. Everything with time deteriorates like our mind and body. Relationships are no different."
2255,its been so long since ive felt like myself.,"ive been messed up for awhile now.ive lost so much sleep and when i do go to sleep its only for like 2 hours. it all started after a break up. i know im to young to know what love is or thats what im told. but it hurts to even think about her. whenever she crosses my mind my heart beats faster with each passing minute. i still write poems for her even though i know shes gone. she was the only reason that i would get out of my bed in the mornings. my mom tells me i need to find someone else and trust me ive tried but no one seems to catch my interest. i gotta put on a fake smile so it can look like im not broken and wear a fake personality. i honestly want to feel something other than feeling alone or numb. ive heard people say 'when you hit rock bottum the only way left to go is up' but i think ive found away to keep going. ive tried therapy and counseling but that dont help much. medication dont either. ive tried writing poems about how i feel like i used to but it just gets worse. i hate feeling the way i feel. im scared of love. i hide from it so i dont get hurt again because i dont think ill be able to handle it. music helps a little. helps me feel like im not the only one in this messed up world that is going through or had gone through the same stuff i am. im only 16 and i really just want to end it. maybe its because i wanna feel something else. whenever i lay down it feels like something is sitting on my chest and it gets really hard to breath. when my thoughts get ahold of me i get angry. to be honest, i dont even know why im writing this down. on here that is. i need help. i refuse to take help from someone who dont know what they are talking about or havent felt this pain. im so tired, its hard to do anything anymore. its a struggle to get up to use the rest room. im always cold even if im wearing a hoodie under 2 blankets. i honestly dont know what to do anymore..."
2256,I don't want to die,"Distracting myself constantly with movies, YouTube clips, anything to make me laugh or just think of something else.
But the thoughts still persist, and lately they started bleeding through. 
Buried myself in my hobbies, video games, drawing, animation.
Forcing myself to be productive, I cleaned the house this morning and did all the laundry.
I made a frozen lasagna and drank wine while it cooked. 
When it was ready I just stared at it thinking ""I'm not even hungry, I could just go to bed right now, it's only 7 but I'm tired, I'll have another glass and go to sleep.""
But I forced myself to eat and now I feel sick, not the kind of sick from eating but the kind of regret you feel for just existing.
I want to keep drinking but I know that I shouldn't.
I can feel myself spiraling, I thought I was getting better but the voices in my head are shrieking.
I want to tell my husband but I don't want him to worry. 
I want help but I don't want be hospitalized or disrupt my life or the lives of those around me.
How do I tell my boss I can't work tomorrow because I'm seeking medical attention for depression?
How can I justify losing money for something that might go away in the morning?
I just want to go back to normal.
I don't want to die."
2257,Does anybody else feel bad because of politics? How did we come to this?,"I don't want to start fights over political views, but, as someone from North America, I feel like after 2016 everything suddenly changed. Not just the TV, hi even people became less friendly. 
It could be related to my age, I finished high school in 2014 and have been spending more time on internet lately..

But does anyone else feel the same?"
2259,I got fired from my first job. I'm so useless.,"I'm such a braindead excuse. I got fired for literally just not being good enough, after 2 months. My employer had to give me the whole ""you're not a failure"" speech. That's just how pitifully useless I am."
2260,Incoherent Shut off,"I can't open up. Maybe it's from everybody I've started opening up to invalidating it and shutting me down or maybe its my parents laughing at me for being sad and never caring about how I'm doing. I feel crazy. I feel like nothing I think or feel is real. I just wanna be ok. I don't understand why i feel this way. Why can't anybody care about me. Love feels fake. I'm sorry. Opening up just hurts, I can huddle it inside until I cave maybe then it'll be taken seriously. I'm sorry cutting wasn't worth your time to care about. I hate feeling alone in a group. I hate feeling guilty about everything constantly. I hate that you're gonna read this and think I'm a stupid bitch. I hate that this won't make sense. I hate that i struggle to do anything. I hate that that's normal for so many. I hate not knowing if anything I do will be remembered or questioning what's real or not. I hate feeling hollow. And i hate being barely functional through it all.. really makes it seem like I'm making it up."
2261,I turned 16,"This past week I turned sixteen and I felt so shitty the entire day. It was just a reminder that soon enough i’ll have to adult and grow up. My parents argued the entire time that day and I didn’t even do anything fun. I have no friends and my mental health, already bad, is in steady decline. I’m failing most of my classes because I honestly don’t have the energy nor the motivation to do my work, since waking up, getting ready, and going to school is draining enough. I have crippling social anxiety and even talking to someone for 10 seconds takes so much out of me. The worst part is I know I’m young and even so such simple everyday things seem so hard it seems the only way for me is down. I don’t even have a job, i don’t participate  in extracurriculars, so isn’t this supposed to be the time of my life? My future looks incredibly bleak and miserable. I wish i had the courage to just stop existing since clearly its too much for me to handle. So yeah, sweet sixteen to me I guess."
2262,Feeling guilty for being depressed.,"When I get quiet and low energy I feel like it effects everybody I meet. I can see it in the faces and actions of my friends and family when I'm around. I feel as if being depressed makes me a bad brother, a bad son, and a bad friend."
2263,Someone just told me that only I can control my happiness and it doesn't matter what others do to affect it,"I'm very depressed because I've been bullied, abandoned, lied to and hurt too many times. Am I really supposed to be able to put that aside and just find happiness within when I have no support and am scared to trust anyone? I didn't think so, but I don't want to be narrow-minded either so I don't know, please tell me."
2264,Something I realized,"Is that I believe I'm a free spirit that is only here to experience existence. It makes sense why I could never connect well with any dogma, philosophy, etc. Truth will always remain there's no escaping that but I believe I'm an unhinged free spirit."
2265,Christmas depression,"Everytime my mom puts on christmas music, i hate it. i get really sad. i didnt want to decorate this year. i just dont see a point to it anymore. its just a day. one day out of the year. why do we spend days putting up endless decorations &amp; adorning trees &amp; houses with lights &amp; ornaments- for one day? its just a day. its a waste of money. its a waste of electricity. its a waste of energy. please tell me im not the only one who feels like this"
2266,feeling lost after a life of self isolation,"I have self isolated most of my life, due to anxiety, due to not quite fitting in, due to ASD, then depression. It was my only way to cope with external requirements. Everything was always too much, so I tried to not do things when I didn't have to. I always dutifully forced myself to do what had to be done (or to at least try), even when it caused panic attacks and very intense prolonged anxiety. 

Of course this way of life meant missing out on so many things that make life worth living. The things people mention when they reminisce about what really mattered, relationships with other people, shared experiences, passionate interests. 

I have basically never really had good friends. I had some acquaintances over the years, people I did things with, but that ended when I graduated from school. We really only spent time together because we were all outcasts anyway.

I had one relationship, which in retrospect was quite the fluke. It only happened because the girl had bad self esteem and really wanted a boyfriend. I haven't even dated since that ended more than 10 years ago.

In the last few years, I've been confronted with the need to accept that certain things just aren't going to happen for me. It has slowly turned from early 30s panicked ""maybe if I hurry up and finally do some things I can still make it happen"" to ""well, I'm almost 40, it's too late and I don't know what else to aim or live for"".

My average day is still always the same. I use my energy and time to do the necessities (which in my case is work/health/chores, and then there's not enough left for much else (like hobbies, relationships, friends), certainly not enough for meaningful change. I have years and years of frustration built up due to my self isolation, and I'm not exactly sure what to do with that.

Whenever I go outside and see happy couples, or just people enjoying their lives and experiencing things, it triggers my depression. Seeing myself in the mirror does the same. Seeing how old I am and how I have made no progress in the things that are truly important is hard to cope with."
2267,A descent into hell,"The rabbit hole of depression. I wish it was like the LSD fueled dreams of Lewis Carrol. Instead this rabbit hole is an endless, pitch black, bottomless pit filled with the evil hisses and laughter of our demons. We constantly claw at something to grab onto to halt our ever violent descent into dark chaos. Yet the deeper we fall, the dimmer the light from which we fell from grows. Eventually the light is so far away that it goes out completely and all that remains is the neverending descent into the hell that is depression. There is no hope, no love, no faith, and no one to grab hold to. So why do we hold on? Why do we fight? I myself have nothing left. Every night I go to sleep, i beg to a god that has already abandoned me to stop my heart in my sleep. I wish someone would save me but I am invisible. My name is meaningless, my face....forgotten. those who I once called friends and brothers abandoned me because they were being drug down into hell with me. I cannot blame them. Everyone is better off without me. Everyone I ever came in contact with was told they can do better than me. They were right. I am a man without a purpose, and without a purpose, why should i fight to live? It's not like I have very long anyways. One day i will breathe my last, and it will be the 2nd happiest day of my life. Knowing that I can never be a disappointment to anyone ever again. So to those still flying down the dark hellish rabbit hole, if you look up and still see the light, you have not yet lost hope. For those who no longer see the light, I hope you find peace in this life or the next. I wouldn't know what to do with peace, probably screw it up like I did everything else. If I die tonight, I die. If I don't, then maybe tomorrow. Til Valhalla, I hope not to see you where I am going.

2268,Therapy,"I'm going to therapy for the first time in a very long time tomorrow morning. It took a long ass time to get here, but I cant do this anymore. The self hatred, selfish outbursts, lethargy, the distinct inability to take any resemblance of myself when I'm in public. The MOUNTAIN of an issue that my childhood feels like."
2269,"Help, I need insight Im currently at a life changing moment.","I recently had an epiphany after 8 months filled with depression, panic attacks, attempts and a trip to rehab. I went back to therapy with the help of my friends and family. I instantly connected to my new therapist. 

I’ve been having a quarter life crisis and decided to go back to studying because I needed a career change. 
Traumatic events have happened and the enthusiasm I had for working turned into anxiety.

My dad offered to pay for my studies seeing as how i’ve been committing self harm and just wanted a chance to do something but couldn’t figure out what. The condition was for me to go back home, give up my freedom and only commit my time to studying. 

I’ve talked to my therapist that the town was filled with toxicity and I haven’t been home for 3 years the last time i was hanging out with the people there I was doing alot of drugs and alcohol teen stuff they were basically my highschool friends and are living  in a bubble.

I live in California but my dad is in manila,ph. He doesn’t wanna fund my studies here because he wants to keep a close eye on me. 

I am basically all in. I want the chance to study again. I’m off social media and I haven’t informed my hometown friends I’m coming home in a few days. I’m so scared about bumping into one of them and that word spreads out that I’m back. I’ve had loads of “friends” there thats been wanting to meet up and catch up but I can’t tell them about my mental health because I’m still recovering from depression along with my social anxiety. I already have a ticket and just waiting for the inevitable. People in my town are highly judgmental. Its a 3-5 months coding bootcamp.

Why do feel so scared about what people will think of me if I don’t tell them I came back??? Why is there so much pressure when there shouldn’t be???"
2270,Is it alright to be alone? M/23,"Just a quick bit of context first. I do not know if I'm depressed. I have never reached out for support, or broached the topic of my mental health with another person. I go to work, exercise, eat and sleep well. I'd describe myself as pretty confident. I've contemplated suicide curiously, but never with the serious intent of doing it. 

There's just one thing, I'm completely and utterly alone. As in, disappear and nobody would know alone.

In my entire life, I have never had a close friend, never been close with my parents, or never had a romantic partner. Childhood, and teenage memories never made, yada, yada, yada. Sometimes, when I have no work, I'll go days without speaking to another person. If I were to disappear the only person affected would be my manager because of the inconvenience. (That's not a piece of self pity, it's a fact as I have no close family or lover ones).

Because of this, I view relationships, close connections, close friendships etc, as sappy, and a waste of time.

Now, of course this is a defense mechanism I have constructed over the years to shield myself from pity and misery. It's an easy deflection to the feelings I get when I realise it's now another year where my birthday has gone uncelebrated, or another year where I'm alone on Christmas. 

I'm afraid that I wont be mentally strong enough to last like this forever. Each passing year is another that I feel is lost to time. No other soul to share it with. The weight of loneliness and sadness thus gets heavier as time goes on. At the moment though I can cope.

I have next to no opportunities to meet new people in my life because of the small rural area I live in. So, do I accept life as a hermit, and keep my worldview on relationships? Or what? Will I only be able to fool myself for so long, and am I missing out on what life has to offer?

So, is there any advice that you can give that could help clarify my feelings?"
2271,Can I just stop being a likeable person?,"I want as few people to care about me as possible so I can just go die without hurting anyone but I keep being a nice fucking person and making friends and shit

I just want to be an asshole so people don't like me. Why is that so hard?"
2272,A rap about my depression,"I played it safe, I stacked up my regrets. Never going outside. Always had a bad vibe. Always was the bad guy. Always lived a sad life.. I lost momentum. Life got stale. I lost my vision. I lost myself. I lost my mission. I forgot who I was and started wishin, somethin different would come and twist it, like some holy light would come and visit, on some holy night and Id just listen. Hearing what I needed to hear I'd cry out my sickness.but This world can be so cold and vicious. This world can be so loving but it feels so distant. Everythings so fragile it could all be gone in an instant. But, sometimes I feel it wouldnt even make a difference. Loss of inocents, loss of living in the moment. All ive got are my mistakes and Im the one that has to own it. The pit of my stomach feels like a closed fist. Theres a voice in the back of my head screaming was it worth it? Theres a feeling I used to get can I please unearth it? The feeling of feeling a sense of purpose.. The feeling im feeling is kinda worthless.."
2273,"I was doing well for more than a month, and the trauma from the past triggered me.","I (30F) had a suicide attempt this morning, trying to jump out of the car. Had to check in at the ER hours later. Will be seeking treatment and hopefully get prescription.

My traumatic past 15+ years ago with my abusive dad has hit me low this time. It’s so difficult to let go and move on, even though I moved out from my parents’ house more than a month ago. I have been doing well for myself...and still am working on it. Trying not to let that cloud my judgment and who I am as person. Depression for more than half of live sucks.

Glad to know that I have a bf who’s been helping me through all of this."
2274,I need to vent a little,"I hate this b.s! The past 4 days have been terrible and I definitely feel like it’s gonna get worse. I feel terrible and want to sleep all the damn time, hell, I went to bed at like 7:30 the other night. Everything is starting to annoy me and I’m scared that I’m gonna snap soon. I’m worried that I’m gonna lash out at my friends and/or family. I feel like I’m gonna be a lot worse by Christmas and I hope I don’t screw up the holidays for my family. I’m also kinda dreading winter break because I’m probably gonna stay in bed for 2 weeks doing nothing and feeling like shit. At least at school I have to get up and talk to people. I wish I could just snap out of this mindset."
2275,I wish I could kill myself without my family knowing,"My family is literally the only reason I haven't done it yet, just because I know they'd be sad and I can't do that to them. I just don't want to keep living though, I wish I could somehow stage an accident that'd kill me. why does everything have to be so shitty"
2276,Appearances can be misleading,"On the outside I'm the outgoing, party animal, with tons of friends, who has no fears or boundaries. But on the inside I'm crying and screaming for help but don't know where to go."
2277,Here I go sliding back down the hole that took too long to get out of.,"My life changed almost 3 years ago and not for the better. Since then I've been fighting to get out of the hole, the darkness that pulls me down, welcomes me and honestly feels like home. I've been on and off meds through this, sometimes knowing I was falling but didn't care.

I got out and it is someplace I haven't been in so long. So exciting that I let myself go too soon. Life being what it is, not fair, decided to kick me a bit. Starting to slip back down and part of me wants to just dive back where I belong. The other part is trying to grab on, not slip too far knowing that life isn't picking on me it's just the way it is. I control how I handle it and I'm not sure I have the strength to fight without some rest. 

Needed to share, to tell someone. Not just for myself but for anyone else who is fighting. It sucks going through it everyday not seeing an end. I am exhausted and I know that's why part wants to go back down because it's easier. You can do it, it's worth it. Just be ready to keep moving forward when your out. I have to stay out of the darkness, I want another shot, I want to be someone different, someone who feels they don't deserve to be depressed. 

Took a turn I wasn't expecting, leaving it there for me. I can't have that stuck in my head."
2278,I started smoking,"There has been very little to take away the pain, the drug abuse, and now I turned to cigarettes for who knows. It’s just more accessible than mj, but I feel disgusting. I just don’t know what to do anymore."
2279,Everyone is better than me.,"First time posting here, feel free to remove this if posts like these are not allowed.

Ever since I've started high school, everything in my life has been going downhill. My grades have been abnormally bad while my classmates earn all As without putting in any effort, homework takes forever to do, and I feel like I'm running out of time. My very competitive high school has been a negative environment for me - I despise most of my classmates and some of my teachers are just awful. My friends all are doing better in more advanced classes that what I take, and even though they're generally good people, all of their advice does not help me. My mental and emotional health has been terrible as well, I'm so negative towards everything now and I feel like no one cares about me beyond my GPA. It almost feels like I'm being trapped in a cycle of self negativity as well as the judgement of everyone else. I don't know if I have depression or something else, and as much as I do want to seek therapy, I don't want to open up my personal feelings to someone else. 

As bad as this all sounds, I have found some new hobbies and clubs I'm very passionate about, which keeps me happy at times. However I feel like my interests are becoming my personality, and I don't want to get burnt out if my passions are everything I focus on.

Any advice?"
2280,Self sabotage,"Lately I’ve been struggling.. I have a past that’s full of hard times and demons. Right now my life is good, so it seems silly compared to what I’ve been through to be having my anxiety and depression creeping through the woodwork... My new job has eliminated all my financial worries, my relationship isn’t perfect but it’s healthy and my friends are supportive and loving. Yet still my chest feels hollow, my body is itchy and overheating, I’m having nightmares of my past, I’m constantly tired and feel emotionally drained when I have any alone time. I feel myself going down a dark road that I’ve traveled down years ago and I’m not sure what my trigger is. 
I went to therapy before, I was prescribed antidepressants but with a lack of health insurance it became too much to keep up with and I was lucky enough to find my own way out.

I’m not quite sure what to do from here though &amp; I don’t understand why my old demons are resurrected, but here felt like a good place to just reach to people who may get it."
2281,Why cant i just be loved forever,"My boyfriend just left me, after my longest relationship, 10 months. Of course, 7 of those months he said he never loved me that way anymore. Somethings wrong with me, why can no one ever stay with me why cant i just be with someone for the rest of my life. This happens every single time and I always just relapse"
2282,Still blaming myself.,"It´s been three years since my father committed suicide and i ""37 M"" am still blaming myself. He was the carefree type got along with everyone, but refused to take responsibility for himself and his circumstances. I always picked up the slack after him but the last two years we were almost in daily contact and things were good, he lived with my grandmother ""his mother"" And when she died his siblings wanted to sell her house, and he did not want to move and finally killed himself in the house a day before a realtor came to check out the house ""he found him"" My point is that i blame myself for not doing enough, i was sick and tired of the way he acted and i was sick of having my life postponed so i could hold his hand. The last couple of months i just had enough, i just started college again and i just did not want to deal with his BS the last thing i ever said to him was ""This is all your fault"" and I was referring to his circumstances. My point is that it always pops up in the back of my mind that i could have done something, He was a dry alcoholic, we tried putting him in rehab, but they kicked him out and drove him to the psych ward because they could not deal with him. The point i am trying to make is that i understand his pain now and i understand why he did not want to live and i feel the same way now. The only reason i think i have not dome it is because it would destroy the rest of my family and i don´t want to do that, Does it get any better? Or is depression something you have to deal with all your live? And yes, i am seeing a Psychiatrist once a month and taking medication. But That only takes the edge of and i am striking blind on how to deal with this."
2283,I wish I could go one day without thinking about killing myself,I have suicidal thoughts daily. No matter what happens suicide always seems like the best option to me.
2284,No friends,"All my life, I had friends. I’m in 10th grade and until this year, I’ve had many friends. Everything changed this year. The beginning was slow but as the days went on, my old friend group began ousting me. They don’t talk to me like friends anymore. I was kicked out of our group chat for no reason and every time I get someone to add me, someone else kicks me. Eventually, they added me to it out of pity but now I think they have a secret group chat without me as no one talks in the one I was added to. I have one loyal friend who is not associated with my old friend group. I’ve never felt this sad and lonely. Every day I feel like a loser and that I’m a social outcast. Why did my old best friend turn on me and act like I’m a nobody. I seriously think something is wrong with me. Please help. I miss the days when we would all go to the movies, or wrestle in my basement."
2285,For the whole sub.,"Ok so my back story I’ll try to make brief. Because I don’t want you to get bored. If you don’t wanna read this then skip to the gap in text.
I’m currently 16 and living in PA. I’m 6’3 and about 320lbs. I have a a family who supports and holds me back. And friends who can be nice and the most hurtful people you’d meet. I’ve been on several medications and most have done more harm than good. I’m thankful that I only spent a week in a hospital for suicidal tendencies, and have only done one attempt at taking my life.


With that being said, I wanna inform some people in a way they can relate to.


I see so many posts on here about people taking those small steps, which in my opinion is one of the best things I’ve seen. For those who haven’t taken those small steps (which to be clear is me as if typing this  post), keep one thing in mind. When things get hard for you and or progressively get harder do nothing and everything. I know that’s a very contradictory statement. But I feel it’s helped in more way than one. That one statement of “do everything and nothing” has refined who I actually am. I no longer second guess myself or what I do. I know what I wanna be in life. And sometimes that’s all it takes to get your mind less cluttered cause you only have one thing to focus on. So take it and apply however it fits for you and your situation.

“Do nothing and everything”

Anyway, do good be good, love you all and I’m gunna get some sleep lol"
2286,Up the river without a paddle,"Fuck I am really at my wit's end.  I just got out of a manic episode where all I wanted to do was fight and self-harm, and now I all of a sudden have no interest in that and I just feel fucking empty.  I told someone tonight that I am fucking depressed and they responded by telling me what I had to live for, which was a gigantic crock of shit.  I'm 21, done with school, just passing time and I really think it's time for me to either move out of the fucking country or just kill myself now.  Everyone keeps telling me that things will get better but I've been like this for over ten years now and I have no god damn clue how I've done it.  Fuck."
2287,What's your bounce back?,"There's usually a trigger to depression. For me it's health and finances. 

Whenever a day starts bad, there's a tumble that if I don't stop ends up going into that dark pit which lasts for days, weeks etc.

Do you have something that put's the break on this? 

In other words you are doing well, then something triggers the depression and you know it's going to tumble. Let's say a larger than expected bill comes in through the door and it all starts. 

Have you found a way to stop this? I bury myself in work, but it doesn't work, just masks the tumble like watching a movie or playing a game. 

Exercise doesn't work. 

Heck even after a large bill, and I get a financial bonus that covers it I'm still tumbling. 

I usually find a whole new project fixes the tumble. But they are energy sapping and not always available. 

Talking doesn't work. 

Just wondering if anyone else has found something to stop the tumble?"
2288,Absolutely no one cares- I have no one,"Every friend I've ever managed to make has turned around and stabbed me in the back brutally.  My family's messed up.  
I don't have anyone and I'm so sick of it.  I've been depressed for literally as long as I can remember.  What's the point?  I'm sick of living with depression and all of my other issues.  I feel like I've lived my whole life screaming for someone to help me but everyone just sits and watches as I sink deeper.
And please don't say things like ""but I care about you."" I appreciate the thought, but you don't know me- you care that a human being is upset, not that I'M upset.
I'm already on two antidepressants."
2289,Tired of being tired,"So I’ve had depression since I was about 14 (now 22) and it’s getting to a point recently where I feel depressed most of the time. I had to take time off work because of it, but I’ve found that it’s just making me feel cabin fevered not doing anything in the day time. My sleeping pattern is messed up to the point I’m not getting up until 2/3pm, and where I live (UK) it gets dark around 4pm. It’s messing me up and just upsetting me. I try to get out of bed earlier but I have no energy and just want to sleep and forget the world, yet when I do get up it gets dark outside almost immediately. I’m also really scared of what’s going to happen in the future, as until I went to university, I didn’t have that many friends. Now we’re all graduating next year I’m genuinely terrified of losing everyone and having to go back to the 9-5 I had when I was 18, and it made me suicidal at the time.
To top this off, I’ve been trying to recover from alcohol dependency. A problem I developed a couple of years ago and now it’s the holiday period I just feel obliged to drink like everyone else. They tell you that you just learn to deal with depression but I feel like I’m just constantly suffering with it, it’s too much. 

I’m sorry for my ranting, just needed to get it off my chest."
2290,Depressed in college,"I'm really depressed. I haven't reached out to anybody about my depression because I'm afraid my peers will see me as an attention-seeker. I can't find the motivation to get out of bed, do my homework, study, or even eat.

I am in danger of failing a good few of my college courses. I'm so scared about finding a job. The worst thing is that nobody knows that I'm falling apart. I'm always happy around other people. I think about committing suicide often. Nothing I watch or do brings me joy. Everybody at my school seems to be performing so well and are scared of getting A minuses, whereas I'm just struggling to get a C minus to pass. I feel like an absolute failure and I don't know what to do."
2291,I wish I could go one day without thinking about killing myself,I have suicidal thoughts daily. No matter what happens suicide always seems like the best option.
2292,I'm tired...,"I have been battling depression since i was 12. I was in therapy from 14 to 25 and went again for a couple of sessions this last year. its getting bad again. It started around august, and has just progressed worse and worse. And I'm just so mad at myself, because for the most part i have a good life. I'm in the first relationship my life where I'm falling in love with this person. I love spending time with even if its just laying in bed watching YouTube or movies, and we have only been together 6 months, so I try not show him how bad it really is, because I don't want to feel like a burden to him, because a part of me is waiting for him to get bored or realize that I'm not worth it. I have a really good paying job, especially for the area that I'm in, and just in the last couple of days, I've fucked up and am literately days away from being fired, and I don't know what will happen if that happens, cause i need all the money I can get right now. I feel so tired and hopeless. I've lost most of my appetite, so I lost 15 pounds and i look too skinny in my opinion and not attractive anymore. I'm tired of feeling like this and most days, I just wish i had never woken up from the night before."
2293,I need some help,Ive been thinking about cutting a lot. I did cut myself a week ago and im.trying nit to cut again but it's so difficult. I dont want to disappoint my bestfriend and make her sad but then i domt know how much longer i can go without cutting because it takes the pain away. I want to ask her for help but i feel like a burden and that im weak. She shouldn't have to deal with me anyways. Ive had to helo myself all my life and ive recently started asking for help here and there and now i cant stop and it's making me feel weak.
2294,I want to go away,"It’s becoming unbearable. My loneliness and the existential dread is getting out of hand. I had a panic attack yesterday, again. And all I could do is hug myself and sit in a corner as I gasped for breath. 

I want to cut loose. I want to go away and I want to experience things. I don’t want to be part of anything. Not the society, not my family, not a religion...nothing. I just want to go away and see the world and I’m fine with doing it alone. I’ve always loved traveling alone and that’s what I did all my life anyway. 

But I can’t do any of it. I’m bound. I’m bound by responsibilities. Responsibility to my family. I can’t leave them and I can’t hurt them like that. No. I’m not here to ask you why I shouldn’t go away. I know the reason for that. I want you to tell me why I must go away. 

I don’t want to live anymore. I feel like I’m being suffocated. Suffocated by everyone around me who does the same thing day in and day out and expect me to do the same. I don’t want to be another mindless cog. I just want to go away. I want to live for a week or a month and just do and see whatever makes me feel good and just die afterwards. It hurts like hell and I can’t end it and it all feels like someone is crushing me with an iron fist."
2295,I'm tired. Burned out. Lack energy. Have gained a lot of wait since started taking antidepressants 10 years ago. Can't take a break because money. Any recommendations for how to regain energy and motivation?,
2296,Reality isn’t real,"I’m in a constant state of dissociation and in a weird mix of being in reality and not. 

Life is starting to feel like a simulation and I cannot for the life of me figure out what part of “me” is me.

I keep having episodes of sensory overload until a wave of apathy comes and washes it down for a while. 

Sometimes I’ll have days where none of these emotions surface up and I’ll feel like a normal person and I’ll think that I was crazy for thinking I’ve wanted to die.

This is not of those times. I’m freaking out and reality isn’t real and this time I just can’t cope so I’m resorting to telling random people on the internet for some reason even though I know it’s gonna help at all and I don’t even know why I’m trying at all. This is all pointless this isn’t gonna fix anything. 

I just want everything to stop. 


Reality still doesn’t feel real. But it is and I don’t know what to do anymore."
2297,Tore my butt,"
I took some breaths. Backed up a bit and made a plan to improve. Just wanted to commiserate. Really doesn't help to have things like this be consequences for light activities. I want to be make more of an effort to improve my birth defect. I know I can do better. 
I get ups and downs. Bipolar 1. I self medicate. I embarrass myself often, I have to smoke a lot of weed to eat and move with my condition. I have better medication, I just lost my ID so I cannot pick it up. 
I have made appointments, but I'm slipping on basic hygiene. Spending money I shouldn't. Connecting less with my wife. I know I'm slipping again. I am bad with problems. Any little change these days makes me feels like I'm going to die. I go to the ER and all they can do is put tubes in me, offer emergency surgeries. Specialists refer me to each other or cannot treat my case. The only doctor that has helped my case lives in Brazil. 
Long story short I am sad."
2298,FUCK,"I DONT UNDERSTAND MYSELF AT ALL

THEY TELL IM DEPRESSED BUT I DONT FEEL IT AT ALL

I DONT KNOW MYSELF

I DONT KNOW IF IM LYING OR HONEST OR WHAT

I DONT KNOW IF IM RIGHT OR WRONG

I DONT KNOW SHIT

I STAY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THINGS AND I WONDER IF IM REALLY DEPRESSED

I HATE THIS

2299,new meds starting today + took a shower,"really pushed myself today to try. went grocery shopping too, first time i got out of the house in awhile. although i wasn’t mentally there, there’s nothing i can do about that. am i... proud of myself?

maybe so"
2300,Life just doesn’t stop,"It’s so hard because it just keeps going, even if you’re too tired to walk, it just keeps dragging you along. I can eat or breathe or talk without feeling like I’m going to faint from overwhelming depression and anxieties. And when I feel as though I’ve made progress, something comes up, someone gets sick, I relapse, I begin to panic, I start isolating. 

When does it end? When can I breathe? Never?"
2301,Finally feeling hopeful. Meds are helping me feel normal and I can laugh again. My binge eating has stopped.,"Realized a few months ago that I've been in the deepest pit of depression for most of my adult life. My depression was probably the worst it ever has been from 2010-2013, when I caught my (now ex) husband cheating on me with his coworker. He became verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive after that. He would make fun of my weight, call me awful names, and eventually he started using his jiu jitsu training to choke me and make me black out during arguments. (Long story why we didn't get divorced right away). Anyhow, there were a couple suicide attempts during that time, at which point the police told me to get help, or they would commit me to a psych hospital against my will. I chose to get help because if I had to live, I didn't want to lose my job, my home, and my dog. I started taking Celexa and saw a therapist. Therapy helped a lot because I also got to join the women's support group my therapist ran for abused women. The meds, however, were giving me terrible side effects like dizziness, vertigo, electrical shocks, and made my anxiety worse. With help from my doctor, I weened off of Celexa and refused to try another drug in fear of the side effects.

My depression has kind of been hiding in the background through the years since then, and I figured it would go away with time. In early 2017, I started losing weight with keto, so I felt ready for another serious relationship, met someone (seemingly) great, and I was falling in love with him. Then I had to move out of my apartment of 4-years due to a huge amount of credit card debt that I was trying to pay down, and couldn't afford to live there anymore. I moved back in with my parents temporarily in my hometown, about 45 minutes away, but I still commuted daily to work (which was very close to this guy's house). I felt pretty pathetic and like a failure because my depression made me not care about my budget and finances, which put me in that situation. A couple weeks later, the guy I had been seeing broke up with me and I was crushed. I got incredibly depressed again to the point I started writing a suicide note. I'm not sure what stopped me other than him wanting to still be friends. We did try to stay friends with him, but it was too damn hard, and I made the decision to block his phone number and on social media to get him out of my mind, and find some peace. During this time, I went from loving my job to hating it because my cool, hard-working boss quit and she was replaced by someone who is lazy and clueless.

Fast forward four months to February 2018, and this guy contacted me through his business page on Facebook, asking how I was. We got to taking again, and within a few weeks, we were back to fooling around and going on dates. By most definitions, we were a couple, but not officially. Then everything went to hell again when his mom died from cancer, I got pregnant, lost the baby, and he broke up with me again two weeks after telling him I miscarried. I was doubly crushed that time. I saw then what kind of person he really was because I'm not sure how cold your heart has to be to break up with a woman who just lost her baby. We tried to stay friends, then be started dating someone else under my nose a few weeks later. Watching him with his new gf on social media made my depression probably the worst it's been since the time I was separated from my husband. I cried myself to sleep almost every night, wondering what I did wrong and why I wasn't good enough. I cried in my office at work, even would break down and cry in my boss' office. I saw a therapist again, who kept telling me over and over again that being friends with him wasn't worth the pain. After giving him a thoughtful Christmas present in January this year, I didn't hear from him for 7 weeks, so I blocked him again, for good. We haven't spoken since, and he hasn't tried to reach out.

My life ever since has felt empty. I got a dog to help fill the void in my life, but she only helps so much. I still hate my job, feel like I'm underpaid and not reaching my full potential because depression and anxiety have been like a cinder block chained to my leg, and trying to drown me. I gained every bit of the 90 pounds I lost in 2017. In July, my OB/GYN lectured me about my weight gain but did nothing to help. In October, I saw my PCP, and got lectured yet again about my weight. She realized my issues go much deeper than just being a ""gluttonous pig."" She diagnosed me with a binge eating disorder and an emotional eater, which is a dangerous combination. I agreed to try Prozac just so long as I didn't have scary side effects like I did with Celexa. That was 8 weeks ago and I feel human again. In addition, I started Wellbutrin as well, since my doctor says it will help hit those brain receptors that Prozac misses, and it helps binge eaters. 

Tonight it's snowy in Nebraska. So I wanted to avoid driving and order delivery instead. Normally I wouldn't hesitate to order a huge Dominoes pizza, plus a pasta dish, and eat it all in one sitting. Tonight, I struggled to order food, but I knew I had to eat something. I am currently struggling to finish the pasta and a slice of pizza. So I'm hopeful meds are maybe not only improve my life, but maybe save it.

TLDR; been through a lot of bad shit, heartbreak, and have been depressed for a long time. Meds are helping me a lot, which I didn't think wouldn't happen."
2302,I’m so done,I’m done. I’m killing my self. Best of wishes to you all.
2303,Anxiety.,"Anxiety is just fear, right? 

Cause I'm scared. 
Scared to get close to anyone. 
I'm so sick of being scared.

You can treat me so good and love on me. 
But I'll still think you're not interested in me. 
You can tell me you love me, on any level.
But I'll still think , ""no, you don't"". 
You can offer me all your help.
But I'll sit and think ,"" Don't take it, they will think you're being ungrateful or needy ""
I constantly feel alone on this planet, because I don't let myself connect with people. I can only let my true self out in a text form. Where I can slowly process my thoughts,  because speaking to you in person all I can do is worry in my head "" Do I look embarrassing? , Do I sound stupid? Yeah, I shouldn't have said that I sounded stupid? 

People tell me to get out of my head, how do you do just that ? I literally feel like I am missing out on life , just constantly worrying if I am a valid human being to this place , if I matter .

 This is exhausting. 
Does anyone else relate ?"
2304,Yelling into the void to feel less alone,"In the past year I've lost every single friend I had, and sometimes I just can't take the feeling of never having anyone to talk to. people would always tell me I'm likeable and funny, but then they just treated me like shit. it's hard to keep my self esteem high enough to keep living when everyone I ever thought was a friend threw me in the trash. so this post is just me complaining to the maybe one person that'll read it that I'm alone and probably not going to last more than another month or two at most"
2305,All of a sudden shit seems to be rolling downhill for me.,"So I've always dealt with anxiety and depression, but its just been kicked into overdrive with the bad news I received today.

First I was told our holiday block leave for this year may not happen because of us being selected for GRF. Which means all the leave forms I filled out to leave base are now useless and not going to happen.

On top of that, my truck broke down, and the bill is costing me around 2000 dollars for the stuff that I needed replaced. but on top of that, the final part I need I've tried to order twice, and its been cancelled twice because its not manufactured by mopar anymore, and aftermarket companies are being a pain in the ass.

On top of that, the girl I was really having a connection with and who I thought genuinally liked me, just revealed her ex who treated her like crap just messaged her, so now she's going to be spending Christmas with him. After all the sweet messages we shared, and then she pretty much blows me off to go and be with a guy who made her cry numerous times.

On top of that, all the money I saved up had to go towards paying off my bills, my truck repairs, and the tow truck, and my student loans.

It honestly feels like life has bitch slapped me in the face, and I don't know where to go.

I try to pride myself on facing adversity....but its starting to all pile up.

All of this shit is just making me feel useless."
2306,If I were to summarize this decade...it’s that we survived.,"(19M, please read though the end) If i were to summarize this decade...it’s that I’ve lost, oh boy did I lose, I’ve lost family, friends, and I lost my special someone who lied her way out of the relationship. I’ve definitely changed as a person, the depression, anxiety, loneliness, and self-hatred has made me into someone I never thought I’d see: Someone who’s a shy, nervous, self conscious, depressed wreck. Someone that is broken. And though I hit many, many, many, terrible lows...I’ve also gained. Gained new hobbies, gained support, gained tougher skin mentally and physically, and despite being a broken piece of shit, I’ve gained a reason to keep moving forward. I know my experiences differ from others, and I know the upcoming years won’t be perfect. But if I can take anything from these difficult times..it’s that I survived. And if you’re reading this, I think you can say the same! Keep moving forward everyone, please! Happy holidays everyone, and I wish every single one of you the best!"
2308,What works for you to get better energy?,"Depression is effing exausting guys. And everything feels like it is too big of a task to do. I really struggle with getting things done.

2309,I’m so ugly.,"My family yells at me constantly 
My friends judge me for having depression 
Last year I had a boy in class just straight up laugh at me and say “you have hair on your chin” (I’m a girl btw) 
Then today I had someone ask if I brushed my hair this morning. I said no. And they said “ I can tell” 

What the fuck is wrong with some people? Comments like that just make me want to fucking kill myself. I feel so worthless and shitty. The reason I can’t find the will to brush my hair is because I don’t have will to live. And I understand that I could shave or wax, but that seems impossible to do. I’m tired of my PCOS and how it’s ruined my life. I’m sick of being ugly and only getting uglier. I’m sick of gaining weight when I eat anything that I want. I’m sick of looking disgusting. I’m sick of avoiding mirrors and showers because I hate myself to much to even look at myself. 

Comments like that make me feel like I should just get thrown out like the piece of garbage that I am. 

FUCK YOU. I don’t have to get out of bed. I don’t have to go to school every day. I don’t have to stay alive. I do these things because I don’t want to make the people around me sad. But every day my family yells at me or ridiculed me, my friends make fun of me and judge me, my teachers don’t give a shit about me, and nobody cares. Why should I stay alive? 

Trust me, I already fucking hate myself for my excessive body hair and my depression. I already hate myself so much that I want to kill myself. I want to die. Every minute of every day I think about killing myself. So maybe don’t be a fucking ashore and point out the things that make me want to die. Maybe be kind to me. Is it so hard to do something nice for a person? Is it so hard to be nice to someone that’s struggling? Is it so hard to shut your mouth? 

I hate myself. I’m going to die alone and nobody will be there. No one cares about me."
2310,"Dumped on my birthday, been numb ever since but can't blame him","Been depressed for as long as I can remember, and on top of that, my latest, and probably last. boyfriend choose to dump me on my birthday.

No worries, that's exactly what's going to happen. I don't blame him, I¨m just no good. It¨s just that he made me feel there was a future even for me, but it was all just an illusion. I fooled myself into believing, and the joke's on me."
2311,I shouldn’t be depressed but I am...,"
Hi, 

I can’t seem to shake off this depression. 

It goes away for some time but it comes back. 

I have $12,000 credit card debt, $17,000 student loans. 

I got laid off from my job. 

I have Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia. 

My concentration is shit. 

I don’t know what I’m asking for here but I don’t have many friends."
2312,Wanted to share the supplements that are helping me immensely.,"I  have struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. I have Epilepsy which makes treatment tricky. I have had seizures on SSRI's, SNRI's, and Wellbutrin and TMS/electroshock are out.  I have been in some dark, dark spots over decades of grappling with this. 

I feel it's important to say that I am not advocating for this route for anyone or proselytizing. My treatment resistance due to my Epilepsy has necessitated seeking alternative routes. I know traditional treatments work wonders.

When I hit thirty, two years ago, I had this dark epiphany... This is it. This is my quality of life forever and I have to decide if I can take this anymore. Then I met my present psychiatrist who has been a Godsend. He was basically like ""Look, first line is obviously pharma, but we can't do that with you. These are supplements that have been well-studied as being very effective in conjunction with AED's. So, what say we try them all on you at once."" I have had a breakthrough. I never thought I would and was at the end of my rope .

Here's what I take (and tl;dr):

Lithium Oratate- 5 mg 2x Daily

Chelated Magnesium lysinate glycinate- 200 mg 2-3x daily. 

L-Methylfolate- 15mg daily

Omega 3's, EPA and DHA from wild-caught anchovies and sardines- 1300 mg daily

D3 Cholecalciferol- 125 mcg

I take some other supplements, like B-12, C, and K2, Tumeric, and Astaxathin but they aren't super correlated with mental health improvements. The anti-inflammatory properties of Astaxanthin and Tumeric are lightly correlated. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Inositol, Methylfolate, and Lithium Oratate feel like the real Rock Stars of the group. 

&amp;#x200B;

This stuff has been a game changer. I feel like a different person and it's a very odd feeling after being such a shell of my former self for so long that I forgot who that former self even was.  Maybe some of you can find relief with one or more of these, even if as an add-on to your AED. 

Wishing you all the best of luck on your journey."
2313,"Cold, Lonely, Confused",I sleep in my car in the back sleep curled up under a blanket. I’m tired of being homeless sleeping in my tiny car every night!! It was freezing cold last night and I am just ready to die. I lost my job after 8 weeks! Now I’m back at square one. I have been homeless since October 2018. It’s hard getting back on your feet. I am a failure. I can’t even keep a job and I need the money.
2314,Hiding my feelings,"Do like the past 5 years I've started hiding my emotions,it happened after my mom got custody of us,and I wasn't allowed to see my dad.i was always open with my crushes, and confident to tell them that I had a crush on them.and now on the outside I'm basically like""love isn't real"" but on the inside I secretly want that cliche movie romance, sometimes I just want to burst into tears,or be angry but I refuse to let it show.
What makes it worse is that people like me now more than ever compared to how I was when I was depressed,they think I'm really nice and quiet when back than I was always called loud and obnoxious.the only good thing is that I don't cry when I hear other people crying."
2315,Feeling like I’m drowning,"Back in July I had to quit my old job because of how much it took out out of my mentally.

I would honestly wake up covered in hives and be psychically unable to get out of bed because of how much I dreaded to go there. I can’t count how many times I thought about stealing my roommates gun and ending it all, but I was too afraid of what happened if I missed or what would happen to my two cats. 

I love working with people, especially in retail where I get to meet people everyday. You never know how much a smile or kind words can affect someone’s day so much. But when your boss is mentally abusing you, and all of your other co-workers, making you work almost everyday and not paying you for overtime. There’s only so much you can take. 

I ended up breaking after 10+ hours of overtime (I was full time. My check is 800 alone, but I only got 600 for it) was missing and texting her that I was in a bad mental place right now and I had to quit immediately because I was scared I was going to hurt myself otherwise and needed to go. The turnover rate for this place is ridiculous, so I’ll also mention I was doing six peoples jobs including my own. For 10$ an hour. 

Unfortunately I didn’t have a job lined up for it, and she (my former boss) is vindictive. So until this month I’ve been unemployed, barely scraping by on my savings + college fund.

 I finally landed a job at universal! It’s the perfect job for me but it’s also too late. I’m down to 25$ in my bank account, my car broke down and I barely have funny to eat. Let alone to buy food for my animals.

It’s beyond frustrating because I need to pay this and pay that, but I can’t. I can’t even take buses there because I get out at 3am and the last bus leaves at 2:30am. It’s also an hour and a half walk away along a highway. I’m relying solely on rides from my family but I can’t keep asking. And my first check isn’t going to be here until after my phone will be turned off and I will run out of food for them. The frustrating thing is I have over a thousand dollars loaned out to friends where I’ve helped them, but absolutely none of them are in a position to return any bit of it. So I’m lost.

I’ve tried so hard to keep my head up, but I can feel myself slipping under again. I don’t want to lose this job, but I can’t keep going like this. I’ve never been this broke and I don’t have anything left to sell. I feel absolutely lost and hopeless right now. 

Does anyone have any advice to offer? I’m willing to listen to anything."
2316,I hate that my shitty behavior makes people around me sad.,I hate that my problems make me irritable or angry.  I hate lashing out at loved ones for no reason.  I hate that people hate me because of who I apparently choose to be. I hate hearing people cry in the other room because I fall short of my expectations or do something to fuck yo their day.  I want to give up.  People give up on me because I’m not worth the time. I know I’m a piece of shit.  I know that everyone hates me. I should really really just give up. It would be better. People would be happy.  They would celebrate the day I was out of their lives.   What’s the point anymore.  Nobody loves me.  Nobody invests time in helping me even if I ask.  I just hear it’s not their job to help me when I’m malfunctioning. I should just be better.  I guess it’s supposed to be easy.  “Just. Be.  Better. “ I don’t know how.  But it does not matter anyway.  Giving up on myself is easier.  I’ll just do that... give up on ever being the positive part of someone’s life.
2317,I wish depression wasn’t something that people needed to hide,"So many people feel like they have to hide their depression constantly from others. I am also one of those people. It took me years to even tell someone that I had depression, but even now I still feel like I have to hide behind a fake smile so I won’t get judged for being depressed. I shouldn’t have to constantly worry about being called an “attention-seeker” and being told that I am just being “overdramatic”. I wish that depression could be openly talked about and that people would be more accepting over a person being depressed. I am tired of putting on a fake smile."
2318,I`d give anything to be 17 again,"I  was kinda distant for our first few months together in highschool. I  really liked you, but I was trying to act as the ""cool guy"". You really  liked me as well, but I showed no affection towards you, I was  protecting my ""jock"" image.

One  day I was hanging around with friends, you came up, put your hands  around me, looked up at me with those haunting eyes, and asked if I  don\`t like you anymore, and if I still want us to be together.

I would have expected from my inner self something like ""yo, the guys must think I\`m so smooth"".

But  I quickly found my heart aching for making you feel that way, and my  knees got weak realizing how empty I would feel if I didn\`t have you in  my life.

I hugged you so tight,  buried my face in your neck and told you that you\`re the best thing that  ever happened to me. The guys were cracking jokes, but I didn\`t care. Not anymore.

Next break I went and bought you flowers, so everybody could see how much you were cared about.

I knew I loved you right then, and that my heart was now yours. Too bad you broke it half a year later.

Could you please give me back that piece of my heart? I really need it. Oh, but you threw it away long time ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I  would give anything to go back to that time. To be your first, although  I\`m not sure I would have been, or you just told me that to protect my  feelings. At least for you to be my first. Not being able to be a man for you has been my downfall into despair.

To  do a better job of keeping you in my arms forever. At least to create  new memories, even if life could have possibly still taken us on  different paths in the end. For us to share that intimate moment, so you  would remember me more fondly. Or remember me at all.

I\`d  give anything to get back to the only time when I was happy, and to not  screw it up. But it\`s over forever. There\`s no going back to that  moment of my life. It was, and then it wasn\`t anymore."
2319,Anybody feels depressed because of how single and alone they are??,"Does anybody else feel this way?
Very single and alone, gonna be the fourth year in 2020. Gone on lots of dates but haven’t met that special somebody. I’m doubtful that person even exists. Every time I fall for someone they treat me like garbage, has made my depression worse in some ways. 
Feeling so alone constantly. Holiday season every year is hard on me seeing friends all coupled up. I often feel if I disappear nobody will even notice. (My parents live in a different country)"
2320,I don’t feel anything anymore,"I don’t know if I’m depressed, and I don’t like thinking that I am because people have it worse, but I just don’t know anymore. I’ve stopped feeling anything for a couple of months now. It all started when my girlfriend of two years left me and led me on for a couple of months. After that my relationship with my parents fell through and has been getting worse and worse every single day. My cat that I’ve had since I was 6 had to get put down and died in my arms. When he died in my arms I didn’t feel anything, I haven’t felt anything in so long. I’m never sad and I only have fleeing emotions of happiness but nothing lasts. There’s so much empty, I don’t even care about anyone anymore. I don’t even pity people who go through hard times. There’s just a giant void inside me and I don’t know what it is. I feel fine I just don’t care or feel anything anymore. I’ve taken on the mentality of “it is what it is” and never duel on anything, even if it’s obviously hurtful. I recently saw a video which told me to think of the last thing that made me truly happy and I couldn’t think of anything. I just want to feel something, I just want to be happy again. I’m so empty"
2321,Overly emotional about simple things,"For example, my sisters cat stopped me before bed and meowed for treats, and I threw them around back and fourth. I was tired so I just wanted to head to bed. She then followed me and acted like she wanted to play and then got mad. This gets so deep into my mind I get this deep depression, not a suicidal depression. Almost as a guilty regret feeling. Like I'm going to run out of time, and with the cat I start thinking like ""oh no I haven't paid any attention to her and then I just feel super bad like I'm a jerk. Even though I know it's overly sensitive I still have stop myself self from crying. And it's like this childish fear sort of depression. Or as if the world was ending before your eyes. It's just spooky. Sometimes I feel so alone when I'm still surrounded by family"
2322,Walking up in the crowd feeling so alone.,"Yesterday while i was strolling in the busy street of our City because it was the opening of Midnight Market I was there to buy some ukelele accessories and eyeglasses for Anti-Radiation while I was looking at people i can't help thinking that they are so lucky that they someone to accompany them whilst me trying my best to get out in the crowd and feeling heartbroken because I was so alone, My mom dont wanna talk to me because I quit the university and my dad is probably somewhere making his own life for him. I have my relatives but i dont wanna bother them. It's so confusing and I feel so lost sorry for the long ranting it's just that I have no one to talk to."
2323,Starting to believe there is no longer a point in living.,"this is probably going to be a long post, i’m also in mobile so i’ll apologize in advance for that. i’m 23F, unemployed, a recovering addict, and i have no friends or really close family. i had a good childhood but during the end of college i became addicted to opiates and have hardly been over to stay sober (with the help of suboxone) for almost 3 months now. growing up my parents never taught me the importance of money let alone saving it. naturally i sit here thousands of dollars in debt from school, credit, and court fees. i lost my brand new job where i made the most money i ever have once i went to rehab. once i lost my job shits only gone downhill. i feel like the only thing good about my life right now is me being sober, and my amazing boyfriend who has chosen to stick with me through everything. 

some days i am okay, i can be happy, i can have a good time but only for a little while. i don’t have really any friends, they’re all gone. i can sit at a party and no one will talk to me other than saying hi or bye and i find by the end of the night i feel completely alone and broken. i don’t know how to even make friends at this age at all as well, and i’m sure that no one would want to stick around given how fucking miserable i constantly am. the depression has completely taken over me. i do not know who i am anymore, and that’s not just a figure of expression. i don’t have any hobbies or shit i do for fun. i sit at home in my bed all day on the internet or watching tv, and if i’m not doing that i’m just looking for a job. 

i just feel like the biggest fuck up there is. i’m just at the point where i am tired. this was the worst fucking year of my life, and i’m really just holding on in case shit takes a 180. and right now it’s only getting worse. i don’t do shit for myself and when i try something different i just hate it. i’m living with my grandparents now and all i want is to be able to move out and have my own place, but with the credit score in the low 500s i don’t see that happening for years, so i’m hopeless. i don’t get to go on nice vacations or let alone go out with girl friends for drinks because i just don’t have that privilege. i’m not close with my family. the only person who used to be a friend is too busy and too different than me now. i don’t even know if my boyfriend will be able to hold on much longer. i feel like a complete waste of space. i’m absolutely hopeless. i just know that everything would be better off if i was dead."
2324,Social anxiety causes my depression,"(16f) I just want someone to love me, but I'm not even in a healthy enough mental space to be in any kind of relationship. My social anxiety has gotten so bad, I can hardly talk to people- especially guys. It's not even sex that I want, it's to be held, cared about, and understood. Drinking only makes me nauseous and tired, and I don't have access to drugs. I'm basically fucked. I just want something to shut off my mind and numb me."
2326,How to treat depression in college?,"I am in college as the title says. I am a male. I live in a house with a bunch of my friends. I would say I have many friends and people that like me and want to hangout and many opportunities to go to social activities. Yet I usually chose not to if possible because of my social anxiety and feelings of not being good enough. I would want to try medication, but along with being in college comes drinking alcohol at these social events and I know that is not good to mix with anti-depressant medicine. Does anyone else have an experience with this being in college and wanting to go out and drink but also being prescribed to anti-depressants?"
2327,Sitting here in my room doing nothing but being depressed,Whats going on with yall? Share ya problems hopefully we can help each other out
2328,I want to go to a hospital,"I want to take myself to a hospital 
I’m 16, I just want to get some help
How do I go about doing this?"
2329,Somewhere along the lines.,"Somewhere along the lines I was broken so deeply, that nothing I do makes it better. 
Nothing can mend it. No time can heal it. No love can envelope me. Nothing will ever change the way I feel. I can not repair my mind, my heart, my soul, my being.  
I talk myself out of driving off cliffs, ""accidentally"" cutting myself. I have this darkness.  I've no clue how to turn the light back on. No clue how to love my life, or myself. 
I'm a disappointment. I'm nobody."
2331,Can I have fake motivation?,"I’m like yeah let’s get something done, let’s move on and have a life, I don’t care what I have to do or how awkward I am, age 24 is finally going to be the time.

But I kind of think I need medication and therapy to really do it, what if this is just another emotion caused by some problem with my brain."
2332,I feel bad for everyone around me,"The only two people I really talk to regularly are my boyfriend and my best friend and I just feel so bad for them. I always need help a lot w school and my boyfriend is always happy to help me w school and it sucks. He has so much better shit to do and he’s deciding to help me. It’s my fault for sleeping or just sitting there not listening in class, etc, etc, I did this all to myself and he’s still willing to help and I don’t deserve it. He’s happy so much and I’m pretty much always sad and I feel bad when he’s having a good day and we’re on ft and I’m just laying there crying or something bc I know he wants me to be happy and he feels so helpless seeing me cry. I do my best but my best is basically nothing. I just wanna be happy for him and I can’t. I can’t seem to enjoy much of anything and I’m ruining my life and I hate it. Yet he he hasn’t left me when he could be w someone so much better. Someone who could actually accomplish something. We’re only 2 months in so I’m sure eventually he’ll get tired of having to deal with me. I also feel so bad for my parents. I’m such a mean ungrateful piece of shit and I don’t help them and I don’t like being around them. Me and my mom used to be close and then things just got bad and we started arguing more and I’d go out more because I don’t wanna be near them and I’d get home and instantly get yelled at for being out too long and not helping and blah blah blah. I don’t wanna be around them and I know they love me and just want the best for me but I’m such an ass to them. I do nothing for them. I wish they hadn’t had me. They deserve a kid better than me. I feel bad that I’m what they got stuck with. My friend too, sometimes she wants to go out and shit and I’ll end up crying so much and I’ll make her sad because I’m crying and I ruin the whole mood.  Sometimes she says one small thing and a lash out on her and I’m so mean to her. I wish I wasn’t such a piece of shit. They all deserve better than anything I’d ever be able to give them."
2333,interesting,"It’s kinda interesting the past...idk maybe year? I’ve been feeling different. Like when I think about myself and what I am. I don’t feel the same heavy sadness. And in fact there are days where I’m filled with drive, days where I feel I can conquer the universe. Before I would have the internal struggle but now I don’t feel combative towards my emotions anymore. Instead it’s fact or rather truth. I now know 100% without a shadow of a doubt I’m the worst. I don’t fight it, I don’t dread my feelings. I understand that I’m nothing and boom that’s that. Like I said there’s no heavy feeling anymore. I do the best I can I deluded myself into think I’ll accomplish what I want but in the end of the day when I turn off the lights and go to bed I know that I’ll never have what I want. I sorta chalk it up to numbers with over 7 billion people on the planet makes sense that not every single one will be happy. It’s okay though. I’d rather not bet on hope cause idk what even is hope. Is it just the word we hold on to and then slap on things that appear to help? Idk sorry didn’t mean to rant incoherently. Lol I guess it is interesting at the very least to observe life. It’s fascinating."
2334,some things i still enjoy that bring me back to that normal feeling we all love and enjoy,"-math! i enjoy solving equations, primarily easy algebra but we don’t need to talk about the level of easiness 

-debating! apparently i can make a good argument, which is always good when trying to get your point across. obviously i’ve lost a lot of that since the depression came back but we’re working on it

-acting/theater! just the thought of it makes me really happy. well, not exactly happy, but it’s not a bad feeling and that’s good"
2335,Just a poem about a day in the life,"Alarm. Wake up? Snooze. 
Alarm. Breakfast? Snooze. 
Alarm. Shower? Baseball cap. 
Go to class. Learn? Get distracted by thoughts.
Forced social interaction. Smile. Pretend to be normal. 
Do homework? Drive home.
Scream at windshield. Cry.
Arrive home. Sleep.
Cant sleep anymore? Distract self with unhealthy coping mechanisms.
Friends? Requires energy and positivity. 
Exercise? A walk if feeling ambitious.
Laundry? Maybe next semester.
Clean? Only to clear a path to walk.
Isolate? Yes.
Fantasize about what it’s like to be normal? Yes.
Hobbies? No.
Kill time on phone until tired again. Cry. 
SLEEP"
2336,I wish someone would just fucking kill me,"So many people are killed every day, why can't I be one of them?"
2338,I just need to get this off my chest!,"It’s been a hard year, last year I found out I was pregnant with my first child. Living with my parents after a divorce they gave me two options abortion or adoption. The father was a fling and he pushed abortion on me. After taking one class at my local planned parenthood I decided I couldn’t go through with abortion and started looking into adoption. At my two month ultrasound they told me there was no heartbeat and nothing else and they rushed me out of the office. In those two months I had formed a bond with the child growing in my belly, I gave up coffee, alcohol, weed and smoking and those were all a big deal to me. After switching doctors I found out I suffered a molar pregnancy  which can lead to cancer and also found out the d&amp;c they performed wasn’t done correctly and I would have to carry my babies dead body inside me for two months. When I finally passed the baby it was extremely hard. I feel deeply back into my depression, started self harming more and just lost hope. Everyone told me it was a blessing from god and I should be happy. But I was heartbroken and honestly it’s not something that’s okay to bring up. It’s taboo. I’m just heartbroken"
2339,I forgot what a good night sleep felt like,"Until I started drinking, I get wasted and it's the best sleep I could ask for, I don't get bad hangovers usually so it's become my go to for a good n8ghts sleep, I only drink around twice a week but it's bad enough, anyway I realized it's been years since I've actually been able to shut my brain off and have a good night's sleep, YEARS, I've been so lethargic for so long no matter how much sleep i get, but just to be able to lie down and go to sleep is fucking amazing to me, to stop my brain long en9ugh to.doze, I'm gonna be an alcoholic like all the losers around me, I'm gonna die as a person before I've even had a real chance to live"
2340,sick,"i hate my family. they don’t care about me, but i guess they care about others. i want to go somewhere far away where there is no one. or just die."
2341,My head is in a war I can’t stop,"What do people do when the brain won’t work and only want to hurt people around me and me I do never hurt the people around me but am tiered to hold my self down. I never  asks my friends for help because I afraid of losing them and scare them away my mind is my worst enemy   All I want I life is too have a good nights rest 
M22"
2342,Major depressive disorder,"I've been friendless,hopeless,and sad for over a year now,I don't think I can feel emotions anymore,Everything is just so boring and uninteresting to me,everything that I loved to do it's just boring to me now,and I don't even want to do anything new,I just feel an emptiness inside of me,suicidal thoughts are all the thoughts I have and it really makes me feel sad"
2343,Thought on my mind,"don't want to do anything
doesn't want anything
you feel nothing interest you anymore
you try to spent your money on stuff just to find happiness 
cause you can't find person that can give you a happiness you wanted to"
2344,I feel alone when I'm not.,"I'm surrounded by caring friends and family, yet I always struggle to have any meaningful connection. I feel really alone and isolated when I really shouldn't. I don't know what should I do, or what to think or do in the future to avoid this. Help."
2345,My girlfriend killed herself in August. I tried to kill myself twice since then.,"I just don't think about anything. I quit my job, stopped going gym, don't eat much anymore. Sometimes I'll post about her online like she's still alive. I miss her a lot. I just play games everyday, and don't go out unless its for food. I'm mostly apathetic now I guess.  I'm glad we live in a time where there are so many ways to just distract yourself."
2346,leave me alone,"i’m so tired of not feeling like myself. i’ve grown to hate any kind of human presence. just leave me alone. i’d rather drown in my thoughts than be surrounded by people. i hate talking to people. it takes so much of my energy, one conversation drains me. it really just gives me anxiety knowing i have to keep going about life talking to and meeting more people. i feel like i’m being suffocated by darkness, sadly somehow still breathing. sigh."
2347,The tears have stopped coming,"I seem to be unable to cry anymore. I wonder whether this is common, whether others feel the same and are similarly incapable of crying.

Although I feel extremely dejected and worn down the tears won’t come. It isn’t that I stop the crying, I feel the need to cry, to let out some of the sorrow, express some of what I’m feeling even if only to myself.

Often I doubt myself; my own capacities and knowledge, second guessing my abilities and even whether what I am recalling is actually what happened.

An example:

I was invited by my girlfriend along to a meeting of hers for a startup she is working on. Since I have some expertise in setting up businesses as well as working in communication and media, they were keen to get some advice on several topics. 

Yet while I was talking about things I know I did, and did successfully to a certain extent, I started to doubt myself. 

“Why am I even here, I haven’t achieved what I set out to do so why should I tell them what to do? I’m no expert, I barely have any real experience to speak of!”

I finished my bit but felt like a fake the entire time, a facade, a liar. I wanted to break down there and then, just sob until my eyelids were puffy and soar; nothing happened.

My girlfriend had to work the entire day the next day, so I went to see a movie that was still playing in the cinema. It had moved me to tears before, so I went with the intent, the hope, to just cry and feel for a bit like I was shedding some of the sadness.

It worked, for a bit, at least I felt something for a while and it seemed like my physical being was in tune with my emotions. Somehow a relief even though it did nothing to help my mood in any way.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Anyone that has to actively seek ways to feel or expres said feelings? Or anyone that doubts themselves as well?"
2348,are distractions good?,"i have found that my depression is at its worst when i am bored and have nothing to do. luckily, i have been able to find a handful of things that i can look forward to on an almost daily bases - but within the day they last no more than 3 hours. the rest of the day is full of my heart feeling compressed and these awful thoughts/feelings. 

anyway, are these distractions good to have? during the time i am participating in them i don’t even think about my depression let alone feel the severity it can get to. are these distractions helping? or are they just repressing the feelings down, just for them to emerge worse when they do come out?

thank you for reading."
2349,Need to find a productive way to end my life but have my family make money via “tragedy”,"Guys I need ideas, this life shit isn’t for me, I mean I’m likable and have friends but I feel so alone and empty no matter what, Weeds stopped working for me and I crave and do prescription opioids  to calm the anxiety and I only see a path of destruction via addiction and I don’t think I’ll ever over come it without substances and with mental health treatment being the way it is I don’t foresee them giving me real meds to help. So this means if Im gonna kill myself then I’ve gotta figure out a way to kill myself yet have it leave a corporation responsible so that my family could possibly yield a huge sum of cash, I’m useless anyways so I may as well have my family profit from my death. All ideas are acceptable!"
2350,i dont know what to do with my life,"i just...dont know what to do, i dont even know if i want to do something at all, i just wanna kill myself so everyone would stop fucking bothering me, im so fucking tired of everything i just wanna have a fucking boyfriend to hug, cry and feel happy again with, maybe then somebody would fucking listen to me for one in my life and fucking care about how i feel...why is it so hard to understand...





i just dont want to be alone anymore..."
2351,An interesting but intolerable side effect,"I've (28f) been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember. My earliest memory of it was in second grade. In middle school and high school I dealt with it on my own. I cut and took non prescribed medications. I was even caught with them and expelled from middle school. I went to an alternative school and I graduated out of that and was able to return to public school in high school. In high school I turned to alcohol and trying to find ""love"" in the wrong places. I ended up in an abusive relationship for a year and I finally got out of it in a brief moment of clarity. After I just barely managed to graduate I finally tried antidepressants. I was put on Prozac and added abilify and trazadone and was on it for about six months with no improvement but I felt like a shell of a person. I quit cold turkey against my doctors advice and nothing came of it. No withdrawal symptoms. Fast-forward about ten years with a marriage and two kids later. My husband and I now have a six year old and a four month old. I got diagnosed with postpartum depression (for me a worsening of my current depression) and I realized I had the same after my first that went untreated. I was now put on zoloft six weeks postpartum. It helped some to my surprise. I felt a glimmer of hope. That was until my hair started falling out in huge chunks and I had sexual dysfunction (anorgasmia). I fell deeper into a depression. I finally called the prescribing doctor and asked if maybe adding wellbutrin would help. It would work for only the sexual dysfunction but I should probably stop breastfeeding while taking both. (breastfeeding is whole other post with its emotional roller coaster) I pondered away my options whilst I was still orgasm-less and I lost more hair. I told them I wanted wellbutrin and wanted to get off of the other. I was given a tapper schedule and a schedule for increasing the wellbutrin dose. I decided to quit the zoloft cold turkey after starting wellbutrin for a week. I thought that was a great idea. After all my non doctor self thought it was very close to Prozac. I am experiencing almost all of the withdrawal symptoms. But I find it worth it as I increase my wellbutrin that is actually helping a ton. I see a light for the first time in a long and a strange hope. I could orgasm again my hair might start falling out less. The worst and intolerable symptom is brain zaps. They last all day long and are not only in my brain but a lot of times going to different parts of my body. I don't know how to manage them. Any help or similar experiences? I do know I will not be taking zoloft again. I'm keeping a medication log just for this with my experience on antidepressants. How long do all of these symptoms last? Please delete if this is not allowed. I just need someone to turn to that might understand."
2352,It took me 8 different antidepressants to find one that works,Yes. Wellbutrin works for me although its side effects are not nice but they will disappear soon.
2353,I need a break,I hate falling in love only to be torn down again. I just want a break man. 😞
2354,Anyone else have a mental illness that makes them want to die?,"I have tics and goddamn are they fucking shit. They make me want to die. They just add to the list of big things I fucking hate and make me want to die. My family doesn’t understand the struggle of my mental illness, people make fun of me for them and treat me like dirt. They make me want to go crazy. There’s times where I can’t take them and it makes me want to die sooo badly. My therapist said that my tics are because of anxiety. She gave me medication for depression and anxiety, but it doesn’t work for shit. This world is shit. Your family tells you to act like a man because crying is bad. Your “friends” make fun of you and push you around. And somehow I still find the strength to put on a fake smile everyday, I think I deserve a medal for being brave enough to wake up everyday and face the fucked up world. I swear if it wasn’t for this one friend I have, I would’ve given up on life a long time ago. I still think about dying but I can’t because I made a stupid fucking promise to him that I would keep on going. Fuck my tics man. They make me feel like shit. They are sooo hard to control. Sometimes I feel like the joker because I get treated like trash by everyone, and I have a mental illness. I don’t often pray to god because I believe that just praying to him doesn’t help for anything, but just this once god, please take my tics away, that’s all I want."
2355,Fearing the future,"My depression and anxiety are getting worse. There’s new changes in my life and some have consequences that could emotionally damage me. For some reason I have been refusing to take my meds even though I know I need them. I’m not sure why though. It’s been very rough, I’ve consulted with tarot readers, mediums and nothing works. I fear for the future. I’m really scared, any advice or prayers would be helpful."
2356,My depression is Lovecraftian,"The other day I was scrolling Facebook and I found pictures of my friends at a movie night from years ago. I realised I hadn’t been invited or even heard of it even though I thought I was part of the group and good friends with everyone. It hurt so much. You may think it’s stupid to be worrying about a party 5 years ago but my friends meant everything to me back then (and now) so it killed me that I was nothing to them. 

Point being, not a day goes by where I can avoid discovering another horrifying facet of my life, and subsequently another reason to die. There’s really no end to how unwanted and worthless and despised I am. Every time I feel like I might be making progress or that it’s not too bad, something else happens and sends me into a spiral and I’m back to square one."
2357,loneliness,"I am the guy who knows everyone and everyone knows me. But i don’t really have any friends. When I moved from one school to the other it was hard being a new kid, i’m now in this class where everyone grew up together, so it was hard making friends. I made one really close best friend. The following year I acted up socially and got everyone to dislike me. I used to have the mentality “fuck everyone and whatever they think about me I still have so and so.”  Now i’ve changed from that phase it’s very hard to overcome it., it’s the last year of middle school. Parents hate me, kids dislike me from there before. Hell new kids that came to my school the same year I did are great friends with everyone, I have another friend group, where i feel like i belong a little more but it’s more of the same thing. I’m usually not invited to parties and i don’t know anybody on a personal level besides that one friend. It’s also sad because she’s the opposite gender of me, so it’s limited of how far our friendship can go. Now we are drifting i don’t feel like i really can go on. I have no one, and it sucks."
2358,I feel like I’m slipping back into depression,"I don’t know if it’s just because it’s getting cold and dark and it’s just that or if it’s seriously coming back. I haven’t been super depressed for like three years but I’ve been feeling bad and anxious lately. I’ve been having full on sobbing panic attack and dreading going or hanging out with my friends. This guy has been acting really creepy towards me and has caused me multiple migraines because of it. Everyday when I wake up I just want to stay in my bed and sleep for a thousand years. I’ve missed lots of school and sports practice which has put me on the might be kicked off list because of it. Please give me advice I really can’t deal with being depressed again 
TLDR: basically the title"
2359,Hey..,I'm 26 male just really need a talk tonight.  It can be about anything n I lost one of my most favorite people today. Just maybe wanna talk till we sleep?
2360,Depression for life...,I feel like I've been trapped in this shit for so long. With only brief periods away and I keep coming back hard. And each time I come back it gets worse. And I'm just waiting for the final time .
2361,I hate my house,"I almost can't sleep. They don't stop talking. During all day there are a lot and a lot of sounds, a lot of people speaking and speaking and speaking.

How the fuck I will sleep with all this noise? I don't have a private room so I listen everything all day and have no privacy. They keep talking almost midnight and wake up early, talking again.

I am still finishing my degree, and decided to ger out of my intern to do my course final project. I don't know when I will have enough money to get out of here and living on my own."
2362,What do you do when you feel like pushing people away and isolating yourself?,I just feel like I haven’t met someone yet who cares about the “real” me. My inner thoughts and issues. It makes me wonder if anyone ever will. makes me want to push everyone away and only communicate when I have to.
2363,Hurt myself again,Yes I know this isn’t good for me but it’s helping right now. Same method as last post. I was tired as fuck all day but this woke me up pretty quickly. I don’t think I’ll ever cut but I do enjoy burning. The sad part of it for me is that my parents are sleeping right above the bathroom I do it in and they don’t know. They always tell me that they’re here for me but I can’t bring myself to tell them how bad my depression is.
2364,How do I bring up depression with my family? (Long post),"Backstory: A few years ago when my sister was diagnosed with severe depression, we talked and I asked her a ton of questions. She told me how she felt all the time on and off her meds, and it made me understand what depression feels like. 

The past few months, I’ve noticed I’ve started to have the same symptoms as my sister described to me years ago, and I’m just not as happy as I used to be anymore. Like, a few days ago, I got my first ever car under my name (instead of me and my dad’s name) and I paid using my own money from my own loan and everything. Basically, I did a very adult thing by myself for once and I wasn’t excited about it at all. I’m stuck at a job I hate with no other options that won’t screw over everyone I work with. I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. 
Right now, I don’t have insurance until January 1st, and I want to get tested for depression because I’ve noticed my parents getting worried about me lately, but I feel like they won’t take me seriously because of the fact that my sister already has depression, she’s doing amazing things with her life, and I don’t want it to seem like “hey look at me! I’m sad too! Give me attention!” And I don’t want it to seem like my parents failed at raising me because I’m depressed. 

Idk. I tell them everything, and I want to tell them this but I feel like they’d pull the whole “you’re faking it” BS."
2366,i cant swallow pills,hi im sixteen ive never been able to which i think is a curse and a gift. if i could swallow pills id like to think id be long gone. i keep trying to die but my body wont let me. its like my body lets my mind make me fucking depressed but it wont let me end it all how fucking sadistic is that?
2367,People will remember you.,"Suicide rates hike up around the holiday times so here’s a small reminder: people will remember you. 

My cousin killed herself quite a few years back around this time. We weren’t close - she lived a few provinces away, our mom’s weren’t close with each other so visits rarely happened, we very rarely saw each other. But when I found out what happened, it was devastating. 

I remember her as a free spirit, an incredibly creative person and someone who was not afraid to be herself. I know that her family has not forgotten her. 

I know it’s tough and hard and it sucks and there will always be bad days. But I promise you that even if you think no one will care and no one will remember you, you’re wrong."
2368,maintaining my life is just more trouble than it's worth,"having to feed and take care of myself, pay my bills, go to work. for what return? stress, anxiety. total loneliness. i don't really understand why i'm pushing myself to keep going. being hopeful for the sake of being hopeful has worn me out. all of the bad habits i collected over the years, all of the things i never sorted out about myself, pushing people away, it's all come back to me and getting out of the place i'm in, untangling everything, i don't have the energy for that. i'm scared. i feel like i'm losing my will to survive and i don't know what to do. it's pathetic."
2369,How do u know you have deression,"So idk if am only sad with life but i just feel alone i know a lot of people but i run outta friends when high school ended, when i laugh i fake it and sometimes i can let myself go through alcohol but at the end i just end up being sad and wanting to cry a little but I don’t know why right know i jus feel alone i can spend hours just thinking about why i feel like this but I can’t figure it out i just can’t.

Ty for reading"
2370,Where did it go?,"My love, for all that was true and good in life. 

Where did it go? 

Life that is sweet, as it is brutal. 

Draining my years, as they are without constraint.

I turn, only to regret my mistake."
2371,My cats are the only thing keeping me alive right now,"I feel like the only thing keeping me from doing something is my two cats. If I died they wouldn't understand. Humans at least get the concept of death but they would just wonder where I went and why I didn't come home. I couldn't do that to them. 

Being with them is one of the only times I feel anything anymore. I don't think I could have made it this far without them."
2372,I did the dishes!!!,"I’ve had dishes piling up in my sink for weeks and weeks. I haven’t been able to do them because everything has been so bad and I’m just so tired. I can’t motivate myself to even do things I enjoy, let alone things like this. But today I did them. And I’m proud of myself."
2373,"Don’t have motivation for the regular things, slowly ruining my life","Lost the love of my life due to inability / unwillingness to stabilize my life. Very good at self analyzing and solving big problems and attaining singular big goals.. but not ones that require repeated small daily efforts. I love people and they seem to like me, I make friends easily but let them down.. sometimes I feel like I may be a sociopath, but can one be a sociopath without bad intentions? I have no structure, I have no stability. I have insane potential, which I see glimpses of when I accomplish big things, but it is worth nothing if it doesn’t last. I am lost, spend most days in bed. I’ve become numb."
2374,Homeless or dead,"It’s entirely feasible to kill myself at this point. I turn 30 next week, I’m broke and my dad pays my rent. I’m unemployed, have had odd jobs but I’m bipolar and always quit after a meltdown. 

My dad just turned off my phone, I guess because I wasn’t responding fast enough. I told him to get me vodka and a noose for my birthday. 

My only options are be homeless (which I’ve been before 7 years ago and don’t want to do again) or kill my self via jumping into traffic/ the train, hanging. 

Boy. If only life went slightly different."
2375,Feeling old and hopeless at 25,"I just hung out with some friends, one of them is going to Brazil with the girl of his dreams and the other is planning to move out to a different state. Both have good savings/income and are about to graduate and complete their masters. I've worked my ass off doing hard labor jobs these past years (my family is very poor) and was then diagnosed with some autoimmune disorder that completely ate my savings. Its as if I've done nothing since high school. 
Now I'm watching my friends leave. I dont even feel like working out or going to work tomorrow. 
I just want to sleep and not wake up. 
Close to 30 and living in my brothers basement, no education, no motivation, no savings, and now no friends. 
Feeling like nothing works, feeling like I'm worthless."
2376,The Empty feeling after the meeting with my psychiatrist for the first time.,"I have been suffering depression for over than 6 years. I always wondered if I was really depressed or if I was making myself that way! Honestly I had no courage to meet a psychiatrist. I was trying to convince myself that my depression could be just fake or things could just get better. I wasn't seeking attention (but deep down I was seeking help like someone to talk to about my depression) especially that I'm good enough at hiding my pain and putting up a fake smile. But when I'm all alone by myself‚ I would cry deeply to myself and have those suicidal thoughts. Things were getting even more worse instead. I felt like I was losing my sane day after day after day like it reached its peak recently!


Fast forward&gt;&gt;&gt; Today I finally made it for the first time to the psychiatrist‚ with one of my friend. (One of the two friends whom I really trust). Honestly‚ I was in conflict before going there. Like I wished he would tell me that I wasn't really depressed and such sadness would go after some time. On the other hand‚ I wished I would hear him telling me that I really suffer depression so that I feel like..I'm finally having something to prove my sadness and emotional pain I have always suffered. After talking to him and telling him all about my depression and problems...he told me that I really suffer a severe depression. He wrote to me a Venlafaxine based medication and asked me to write down some stuff for the next appointment. The point Is that I have been feeling complete emptiness in my heart (like it left a great void in it) since then like I'm diagnosed with depression. What's next? Things might get even a bit better from that point? I really want to change myself. I will do my best this time to get better even after exhausting myself for failing over over and over and over again before that I totally lost hope. I want to live as normal person and feel real happiness at least for once. Don't know what's gonna happen but it is worth the try!!"
2377,needed to let this out ig,"Life sucks. I can’t remember the happiness I felt before I became so deeply depressed. 
Grandma and mom are abusive. Dad’s trying to work out his own stuff, but I’m thankfully living with him instead now. 
At school the other day, the guidance counselor asked me: “do you have thoughts of harming yourself?”
Not in a way as I implied it,,, but I’m going through many things that could make me feel that way.
I said “no.” Which was a lie I guess. 
I explained my past experiences w it from years ago so they could hopefully not ,,, suspect anything
I do. A little bit.
I would never actually do anything. I’m too scared. I don’t actually want more pain. The amount of numbing, emotional pain is already enough. 
Late October, I kept thinking to myself abt self harm.
It went away for a while, then came back mid November.
It’s better now. Now it’s only : “lolol if I just die then I don’t have to go through this hahahaha”
Again, I’ll never act on any of this. 
It’s just the thoughts.
I want to reach out for help, but I can’t.
I’m scared.
I don’t want anything to happen w my dad and mom in court and have my thoughts used against my dad with custody.
I don’t want to go to residential.
I don’t want to go through any of that stuff.
I just want to be happy.
I want friends. 
I want the numbing, black hole in my heart to go away.

sorry this was unexpectedly deep and I literally just made a whole reddit acc just to post this . 
I don’t know why.
It feels good to be able to put this somewhere where nobody knows who I am, I guess.

All that aside, I hope you all have a wonderful day!"
2378,"Hello, good bye","My only friend decided to abandon me tonight. So that's it, my last and only friend. I loved her, more than anyone will know. She was quite literally my only friend.

Just like everyone else, I guess she saw the inner piece of shit I am.

I've put it off for years, but I now know I'm a waste of resources. My death will mean more worthy humans will be able to flourish, if only for a moment.

Just needed to put my last words somewhere, as a suicide not would be laughed at. Here goes several thousand milligrams of seroquel! I will finally be able to sleep.

♡"
2379,Old habits.,"Over the years, I've realized how much I've changed as a person, and it made me a better person than I give myself the credit for. But I don't know why whenever I take a second and just look at my life I catch myself doing unhealthy habits that I've had problems with in the past and it just makes me disheartened since I realize that maybe I didn't change all that much. I feel like I'm in a better place now, but even though I realize that I feel like I need to change more or it's like nothings really happening. I may be changing but everything else is the same and I can't do anything about it. I want to do so many things but as I grow older I realize that so much is limited. I thought that atleast my friends would understand but they all seem so happy, or they're just busy and I wonder why I can't relate to them. Any bit of attention I get, I just overthink it and when it falls short I can't help but feel disappointed. I wish I could always focus on the the positives, but sometimes it's impossible. Everything is so temporary, so fast, everything is so busy, everyone is so isolated and I hate it. I wish I could relate to more people. I realize I have friends and maybe I should open up, but I have issues with people leaving me and trusting people. I'm afraid once I start opening up they'll leave me like people in the past. I realize I'm in a healthy space, but my past just fucks with me and I can't help but overthink every feeling. I don't know, my thoughts are all over the place I guess. I just want to understand what life has to offer and if I'm truly getting better."
2380,"A discussion: Life, death, meaning and suicide.","It's about time someone start a constructive discussion in this subreddit.
First, I would like those of you who are serious enough to read this [material](https://www.osho.com/osho-online-library/osho-talks/madness-society-neurosis-c70dece1-c4d?p=66ad1434d040408a5d1eb3a0ab95e4c8) on the subject of life, meaning and suicide. The material is lenghthy, the topic is heavy and the content is a lot for the average mind. I totally understand if you decide this is not for you. But for those who  read the material beginning to end, I invite you to join in this discussion."
2381,I think wanting to go back in time might be the worst feeling in the world.,"I just can't stop thinking about when I was happy, before I fucked my life up. I used to be very social, lots of connections, hardworking. I had a great living situation with great friends. Now I have nothing. I consciously chose to destroy it. 

Nothing seems to be helping my current situation, and all I want to do go back in time, wake up from this bad dream. I feel so lonely."
2382,I don’t have anything to look forward to. No reason to go on.,"Title says it all.

I’ve always been a lonely outcast. Just someone who nobody would bother with at best, or to ridicule more often than not. I was always just... different. I never fit in nor had many friends in any context, even to this today. My social life is beyond dead. There’s just a couple of people online who put up with my bs. I have no job, no hobbies, the only girl I have ever had a chance with wouldn’t give me a shot. My family life is constantly on the verge of collapse. The less said about the state of my home country the better...
My life is miserable. With the way things are going, I have nothing to see tomorrow for, let alone the 2020s. 
Life has taught me that I’m not worth anything, any shots I take are useless, and happiness eludes me at every step.
What’s the fucking point."
2384,Staying busy,"Anyone also trying to stay busy, everytime I am alone with my thoughts like when trying to sleep or in the shower the only thing I think about is suffering, loneliness and wanting to die. My expectations of people and life are so low I am not surprised by bad things happening, im just like oh well another bad thing that sucks. But im just so numb I feel like I have no purpose and life is just suffering"
2385,Don't know what to do anymore.,"Tomorrow will be my 29th birthday. For me, is one o the saddest days every year, because it only reminds me how alone I am, I how much of failure I am, I have achieved nothing of importance. I've been depressed since I was 16-17, but the two last years have been disastrous. A year ago I had an accident and broke my ankle, and spent 5 months in recovery. During that time the girl I was dating left me, my friends barely checked up on me, and my economy was strongly affected.

Since then everything has gone south. I've recovered completely from my lesion, but my mind is another history. I've never been the assertive kind of guy, but nowadays all I have are negative thoughts. Every day I'm thinking of how much I want to die (or to put an end to this constant state of despair). The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is that I don't want my parents to suffer because of me (or so I want to believe is because of that, and not because I'm a weakling).

Nowadays I can barely socialize. My performance at work has decreased severely, I'm making a lot of mistakes an I fear they're gonna kick me out (I need that money).

I've been talking to my ex (the one that dumped me when I broke my ankle), I was thinking that maybe we could be together again, and she was very receptive about it. Today I found out she's going to spend the holidays with her boyfriend and his family.

My friend barely talk to me no, they think that my depression is just me looking for attention, and that my negative thoughts are annoying to them, one of them said that I was toxic, that ***I was absorbing their energy***.

I don't know what to do, neither hat to expect about my future, I don't want to live, but I can't die right now. I have no goals, no hope, no aspirations. I'm tired, and sad, I want to cry but the tears don't come, I feel like I'm about to explode. I want peace..."
2386,Emerging from the fog,"Sometimes everything feels so real, colors are more vibrant, sounds are more clear, and objects have different textures when I touch them. But then the moment passes and I slip back into the fog. Thanks for listening"
2387,I have too put on a lie to look happy too everyone.,I hate life and I don’t understand why. I never ask for help. I have no one I want to tell. This is my first time asking for help.
2388,I wish I wasnt too much of a pussy to kill myself,"Living like this is too much for me. I cant handle all these emotions anymore, but I'm too pussy to kms. Why am I like this"
2389,Probably would’ve gone insane without this subreddit,It’s just nice to finally be able to say what’s on my mind and to also see other people’s experiences with depression. It makes me feel like I am not alone. I also found this sub at the perfect time. I discovered it after I was kicked out of school which meant that I was pretty much always alone at home. So thanks for keeping me sane :)
2390,I just had an eye opener today that my depression is affecting the relationships I have with my friends,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been suffering with depression for many years. My parents divorced in 2013 and my 16 year cousin who was like a brother to me passed away in an accident in 2016, so it has always been there. However this year has just made it flare up. My dad abandoned my brother and I and could not be bothered to talk to us. But honestly he was an asshole.  I could not care less about him. 

Today it all flared up after I had a fight with my mum  and I took a shit ton of pills and passed out after an hour. I have always had a slight pill addiction since I was 19, now I am turning 22 next Monday. Today however, I went overboard. 

 Once I woke up, I  started acting in a disgraceful manner, especially to this friend of mine who I really care about and I am worried that my disgusting behavior might drive her away from me. I wrote her an apology and promised her that I am going to get better for real this time. I just have to wait for her response. 

This friend of mine is honestly an amazing person with a pure heart and I will kick myself for the rest of my life if she leaves cause of my bullshit.  I always thought it would be impossible to change the way I am, but today I have decided enough is enough, I am not going to lose control no longer and lose people I loved. I have lost enough in this world already.  I can't afford to lose a good person in my life. 

Today starts my journey to become a better man. I am gonna be more positive, probably see a shrink soon, hit the gym more often and put a smile on my face regardless of the situation.  However, through this journey, I am more than happy to help anyone out who is suffering, because NO ONE, no matter your background, your living conditions, should ever go through depression.  

If anyone has a question or wants to share a story. I will be here to help. I might not reply immediately, but I will respond when I can :)"
2391,Things to do instead of dying,"Dig a tunnel straight through the night into next year to unearth a memory, with amnesia as a side-effect.

Deep-sea dive on the ocean floor in search of a lost anchor; get anchored in that way.

Conduct a study on the causal relationship between longing and suffering. (Spoiler alert: it's vicious cycle until you die)

Sit in a chair and write your life on the air. Never go anywhere."
2392,What’s holding you back?,"Been tryna end it for god knows how long. Just something holding me back. Idk what it is. There just doesn’t seem to be a reason to stick around anymore. Part of me just wants to do it as revenge. For those who didn’t value me and those who just chucked me to the side. This is your fault. It’s wrong, I know but there just isn’t anything I can think of holding me back anymore. Maybe it’s finally time to pull the trigger"
2393,Putting off finding a job and idk why,"I recently finished school and I told myself I would start looking for a job related to my degree when I did. I just finished school a couple days ago, but I  just get anxious thinking about applying or asking professors for opportunities. It's almost like I feel like I don't deserve it for some reason

Idk if it's anxiety, depression, adhd, or maybe all three."
2394,I have lost all motivation,"I don’t even leave my fucking house. This has been going on for 8 years now. 

I leave for rehab on Tuesday. 

I want to die"
2395,Warmth,I just want to feel another’s persons warmth this cold has settled in so deep some days I don’t feel like I’ve ever warm up
2396,I can't wait to get a career and live by myself. My parents are so annoying,My parents are so narcissistic. They act rude-snobbish sometime. Sometimes they are nice.  It is driving me fucking nuts. I question my existence at times. I'm trying to get a job to distract myself from the hell at school. I'm 18 by the way.  Don't want to go straight to university after high school. I don't to devote massive amounts of time and money and it going to waste because I decide to back out. I don't want to be in debt and I don't want to be depressed. I don't want to go through massive change when I'm young.
2397,Cant connect with other people,"I just moved to Mississippi and I really hate it. I have multiple attempts to get out and meet people but I just end up feeling super out of place. Everyone talking about things I have no interest and I really try to make a genuine effort to engage and I feel ignored and I hear people talking about me later. This has happened multiple times with different groups of people. There was a group of women talking about their family silver-wear and competing with their siblings about getting things from their parents.  I don't understand why people say the south or small towns are friendly. I am not white and I feel like I get looked at lot when I go out. I just find people staring at me when I go out to restaurants. I feel very uncomfortable here. I don't want to judge others but it just appears people are really striving to impress each other with their nice things and how well they fit into the idea of a perfect American family with their babies, dogs, sundresses, and cowboy boots. Sitting through 30 minutes of an ornament exchange where everyone Oohh's &amp; Aahh's because  it was hand painted/sculpted by a local artist or in the shape of the state. I don't even have a Christmas tree, not because Im against it but I didn't want to spend the money if its just me.   Its going to be very lonely time here."
2398,Bad day and thoughts are making it worse rant,"I've been having bouts of insomnia due to depression so when my s/o 's family were talking about doing DND today I said I didn't feel up to it. So in the dnd chat it was just said they will do easy snacks. And his mom said they probably will just visit. Because they have strict cleaning duties to do so they are going to quit at 4pm. 
I woke up with a rebound headache at 130p and I asked my s/o to get me pain killer he grabbed the pm pain killer on accident which makes me feel super sick/dizzy. And now they are all playing DND still when I had stuff I wanted to do with my character and was actually excited about and I just feel lied to and left out. 
I kinda feel like quitting all together. I know it's dumb but this feels like the last straw with my depression because I can't afford Christmas gifts again and I haven't been able to over several years. (Very fixed income) I am struggling to make gifts because everything I do keeps failing. And holidays already suck. My pain and anxiety has been through the roof and I can't sit up for long periods of time. (Another reason I took pain meds because my spine feels like it's being crushed every day) 
I just want to give up. And to top it off I forgot my meds the day before yesterday and I felt like I was having a heart attack from a panic attack. And I feel so dismissed when people say you shouldn't worry about that your young. Do you know how long I've been struggling with high (bad) cholesterol? Nearly 10 yrs. And I never work out so I do worry about it. I feel like shit. Seriously I'm just done."
2399,Does anyone else feel like you're in a movie and you're the supporting character instead of the main character?,"I feel like my entire life has been dedicated to someone else. I'm the one that's there for them when they need me. I'm the one they toss away when they're done. I never really accomplished much because I've been so focused on the success of others. I've been the care taker for so many people that I didn't even realize that I needed care myself. Now asking for someone to take care of me is a hassle and a chore. People know who I am and think me needing help is me being lazy. 

I'm always on the side lines, cheering others on and never focusing on myself. 

Does anyone else feel that?"
2401,Here's something I wrote a while back. Needless to say I was feeling low.,"Depression

When you're walking and everything grinds to a halt

When the weight on your shoulders isn't your only fault

And you feel like you've come to a standstill

And that adrenaline is your only thrill



When you feel the wind against your sails

When your ships mast does nothing but wail

And you feel the grinding of the beach under the hull

And your compass needle takes a turn full



When the pitch in your belly is blacker than black

When the doctor you played was quacker than quack

And your eyes leak tears and you don't know why

And the wings on your back won't flap to comply



When you feel cold although you're by the fire

When it's a mirage that's what you desire

And your thoughts flicker like the flame

And you don't know who else to blame



When your smiling mask does reveal its cracks

When you feel everyone's talking behind your back

And it saddens you to see yourself like this

But what can you do but take the punch and stay quiet?"
2402,Too low to type,Was going to type out my feelings but i have no motivation. I am hitting rock bottom and don’t see the point
2403,I can't handle life anymore.,"So I have been overly stressed out lately. Starting to feel as if my life is only going down hill and I don't know how to get out. 

I quit my sales job a year ago with six months of bills money saved up for the wife and I but we still had to live with credit cards because life was just not helping me. Took a year to find a job... Finally got one but it doesn't pay enough and I am constantly emotionally abused by my boss. He fucks up my department in my store on a daily basis by forcing shit out to my store that I can't sell thru and then comes to me and just berates me and says I am doing a terrible job even though payroll is tight and I don't have enough employees.. I know, retail in a nutshell. 

Wife has been stressing out with her job too and I feel trapped because I have no degree and no time or money to get one. Learning disability causes me to suck at pretty much every class I've ever taken so I have only ever passed like 3 classes in college and it took me longer than most to do it.

Bills are just stacking up as it's hard to pay for shit while living pay check to pay check. Wife is worried about me because I am losing weight, I don't eat some days because I worry about money and also stress just makes me not hungry. 

I just feel like I am losing an inevitable war of life and I am hitting a point where I no longer feel most emotions either. Too tired to love and respect even myself. 

Just need some advice maybe on how you guys handle your situations if they've ever been so bad? Any time someone gives me a compliment now days and says I'm doing great, just makes me sick because I don't feel like I can actually unload what is bothering me onto others so I just bottle it up and act like I'm just peachy all the time."
2404,Is there a way to make sure you die during a surgery?,"Maybe take a lot of blood thinners right before the anesthesia? I realized I'm gonna kill myself anyway now that I lost my best friend, it's only a matter of time."
2405,I wish I was someone else,I’m so tired. I don’t like myself.
2406,Help me please,So it’s 1:3Am and I just realised that I’m gonna get old one day and it’s really making me feel anxious somebody ease my mind please
2407,Venting out,"I am just done. 

Just done with everything. I want to end it all but i am too scared of the void, the darkness that’ll hit if i kill myself 

I hate myself with a passion. And when i think about getting better, I can’t because I’ve been like this from the moment i can remember. I’ve been broken from the moment i was born and you can’t fix what’s broken 

I want to get better but i always ask myself what does that mean? It doesn’t mean anything for me because I don’t know what’s better. I just can’t live with myself and i am completely scared and terrified of everything in my life rn and i know that i am by myself and no one can help me.

But can i do if I can’t help myself either?

I don’t want someone to say i am sorry or i am here for you. I just wanted to get it out"
2408,For when you feel so empty and drained and so frustrated.,"hey stranger. you probably just want the pain to stop and are so sick and tired of hearing bullshit remedies that aren’t permanent, ‘cause same. but this helps me so i thought i’d share. 

: make a list of all the reasons you’re living right now. 

it’s such a relief and it gives you a little bit of relief. here’s my list:


why i’m living

	•	sexy fantasy romance stories
	•	hope that something will enlighten me
	•	a couple of tv shows 
	•	hope that i will find someone to love unconditionally 
	•	the hope that my hair will get long, my body will get sexy fit, and i will be desired by the right men 
	•	i will soon be able to wear really nice fashion that make me look cool or sexy
	•	the hope that i will get dark nights with loving, crazy, weirdo friends
	•	beautiful songs"
2409,Cornered,"I'm not sure where it went wrong.

My wife has had trouble showing affection and herself was/is frequently depressed, but for a while she came around to being positive because it feeds on itself right? (Manifesting your reality and all that.)

Then she met this guy. 

Then I screwed up our taxes causing the house payment to go up.

My job is in jeopardy because my company is struggling.

She goes out frequently and travels often, but gets extremely irritable if I want to. I'm always left home to care for her kids. 

I just want some sign that I'm loved and I get nothing that tells me she feels that way until I mention calling it quits.  I'm thinking maybe if I wasn't around anymore she would be happy and the kids better off.  Quit my job, cash in my 401k and just surrender to this empty feeling I've had.   


Sorry just had to say it somewhere. I feel alone in this."
2410,Depressed and apathetic despite finals being next week,"I’m not exactly a mess, but I feel very broken and numb. I’m scared about how I’m apathetic about finals next week. I’ve barely studied (mostly due to being extremely busy and I’ve been using the weekend to recover), and honestly I don’t care. But I have to take the tests, and they could fuck up my grades even more. I have so much to do and so little time, and all I want to do is cry and lay in bed. I haven’t felt this way in years. 

Recently, I realized that my happiness last year was all based on a lie. I was happy because I had a boyfriend, and my ‘friends’ talked to me because I was my boyfriend’s girlfriend. I was able to ‘overcome’ my depression by myself without therapy and meds, but really it was because I was already joyful and had a foundation. Realizing the happiness I thought I achieved was all based on a lie really fucks me up, kind of feels like an existential crisis. And now, I’m faced with a lack of friends and motivation to do anything. I don’t want to do the things I enjoy, my rooms a mess but I can’t get myself to clean it. everything seems gray and dark and I want to be free of it. If anyone can talk I’d gladly appreciate a friend right now. + Not feeling suicidal atm, but I have a history of it."
2411,The problem,"To give you context, I'm a young woman, somewhat attractive, I have a lovely family with a mum and dad married and beautiful sister's. I have beautiful friends who are all incredibly intelligent people. I'm not shy, I don't struggle meeting new people. I don't have a history of drug abuse, homelessness, sexual or domestic abuse. 

I play guitar, I sing, I write poetry, I have access to hobbies and activities. I have access to all sorts of creative outlets and entertainment. 

I have a job that I studied for. I like my job. My manager is lovely and my co workers are very caring people.

All round, I'm a decent person, I try to do good things for myself and others around me. 

My life in retrospect is really good. I would say I'm privileged to live the life that I do. 

So why am I so depressed? Why do I wake up in the mornings wishing I didn't? Why do I have this looming cloud of melancholy that never seems to dissipate? The problem is that I have no real problems to blame this intense feeling of sadness and despondency on. I don't feel connected to this world any more and to be quite blunt I don't think I want to be alive for very long. I think that is really selfish for me to say. 

I don't know whether I'm asking rhetoric questions or just ranting. I guess I just needed a place to vent to strangers who could be objective towards this particular problem."
2412,Fluctuating suicidality from self harm?,"In going to keep this short because I dont have the energy to write about this in detail. I have a habit of punching myself in the side of the head when I get extremely frustrated and it always affects my mood in a weird way. I usually end up hitting myself whenever I'm feeling extremely suicidal and depressed, but ironically enough when I strike myself in the head hard enough I go into a daze and enter this state of numbed apathy which lasts for several days which effectively gets rid of any intense feelings. Does anybody else do this? It makes the return to suicidality intense but in the meantime it's an incredibly weird and disassociated feeling, like I'm some sort of preprogrammed robot and then I begin to feel guilty for faking my condition."
2413,"Hi, this is my first ever post on reddit","Hello everyone,
I'm a teenager in my last year of high school, and every day is so hard. I have a normal life, friends, extracurriculars, a good-ish family, a loving SO. And yet, every day I can barely get out of bed, I have lost all interest in the things I used to love. I've been dealing with these emotions(or lack thereof) since middle school and ive always been able to keep them in check, but recently, i.e. the past few months, I just don't know what to do. My already mediocre grades have gone to abysmal. I cry every day because I'm just numb to all my old emotions. I miss being able to feel joy, I miss being able to be surprised. I could never kill myself. I couldn't do it to my mom and my girlfriend and everyone else. But damned if I wouldnt do anything to make the pain stop. 

Sorry to fill up space in the thread, I just needed to say something to someone who wasnt my friends who are genuinely tired of hearing my thoughts every day. 

Thanks guys."
2414,i told my closest friend about my plans to end my life,"he told me he’s confident in my ability to make the right choice and he said that there’s many of our friends that love me and would miss me. he said that i’ve made the biggest impact in his life thus far and that i’m his closest friend. i made him promise that if something were to happen to me, he would try his best to be okay. i told him i needed him to be okay no matter what and he held my hand and told me that hopefully nothing will happen but if it does, he would try to live everyday of his life for me and i would always be with him no matter what. i hugged him and told him he’s everything to me and he hugged me back and said “absolutely everything.” i feel so awful because one day when i do take my life it’s going to destroy him. i don’t think i would ever be able to handle seeing him in that much pain."
2415,Non-SSRI antidepressant?,"Hi, I currently take Elvanse (UK Vyvanse) and have tried Sertraline in the past for moderate anxiety and depression, but the side effects of sweating, diarrhoea and muscle cramps were too much so I quit. I later found out that SSRIs are contraindicated with Elvanse due to serotonin syndrome, so I’m apprehensive about starting another SSRI even though I found the effects were generally positive.

So I want to try another antidepressant but I feel like my options are kind of limited. From my understanding mirtazapine doesn’t work as strongly on the serotonin receptors, does anyone know or can recommend some other atypical antidepressants?

If antidepressants aren’t an option, what can be discussed with the NHS for anxiety? I’m not interested in diazepam due to addiction and withdrawal risks etc. And it’s rarely prescribed anyway. I was thinking maybe something like propranolol."
2416,Could someone cheer me up a little...?,"For the first time I've just got told by someone to kill myself online, that I'm pathetic for not being able to kill myself, that I don't deserve happiness and that I'm selfish for wishing others cared about me... and for some reason I can't stop myself from taking it to heart..."
2417,I don’t think I could ever actually go through with killing myself,But I really wish I wasn’t alive right now.
2418,Oh shit! I'm doing this again! :(,"Wtf? Why am i wasting my time on YouTube and reddit, and arguing with random strangers on internet rather than studying for my upcoming exams :( ? Why do i waste time and then regret? I should have been studying now instead of typing this 😟. This internet is not gonna help me to reach my long term goals for which i need to study.. but idk sometimes im like still here for immediate happiness.. :("
2419,Suicidal after an failing exam,"I'm sitting in my bed after another 11 hour sleep, still tired with an extremely sore back &amp; I just don't know who to talk to. There are moments during the day where I become suicidal and others where not a thought comes into my head. I don't want to see anyone or reply to any messages, I just want to be left alone.

For context  I'm on 3 medications for bipolar but mostly deal with depression and my sleep over the last 6-12 months has been getting progressively worse. If I don't take medication I'll just stay up all night, then if I don't set about 9 alarms I will sleep 12 hours or spend the first half of the day in zombie mode. I took one of my final exams the other morning &amp; didn't answer half of the questions because nothing was coming out of my head. I walked out of the exam wanting to walk straight into the ER because I knew that once again my mental illness had defeated me, despite how much I studied and worked so hard for the last 6 months. 

  
I don't feel comfortable talking to my partner about it who is out of town anyway, my family lives interstate, I don't know if there is any point calling my psychiatrist because I don't know what I would actually say to them and I don't trust any of my friends. At the same time I feel like I need to tell someone how seriously bad I'm feeling but once the cats out of the bag you don't know how or what will happen after that.  This above situation has happened so many times with uni and I have applied for special considerations, retakes etc, because of my mental condition. I have contacted my uni about this occurrence but I don't think I have the energy to follow through with it. 

I feel like such a burden and that I'm just not meant to be one of those lucky people who comes their mental illness &amp; graduates. I've completely fucked everything up and I feel there is nothing left for me to live for, I chose to study in my field to help people with mental illness and enjoy university but I can't seem to get through it. I'm so exhausted from repeatedly  trying and failing &amp; telling the people around me that I've fucked up again. I wish I could express this in words to someone close to me or a doctor but I'm so ashamed.  I feel like I don't exist &amp; I'm ready to check out. 

Sorry for the long post I really needed to get it off my chest."
2420,doesn't life come so impulsively?,"i went to create a reddit post, not even having an intention to write about anything. this goes for anything else in my life, basically. my life is impulsive. everything is a living hell and i wish it wasn't. i wish the words could come out to description, to a definition but the possibility of that is just unable to be grasped. life is a living hell.

everything is a living hell.

why is life so SHITTY"
2422,I've given up,"All of my problems would go away if I just died, but I'm too much of a pussy to do it myself. The only reason why I want a job is so that I could get my own apartment, not bother anyone anymore, then slowly wither away. I can't remember the last time I've been happy, and I've just given up on that fantasy."
2423,Treatment questions,"This is a pure curiosity, so if I’m wrong or you experience things differently please correct me. 

Depression (in some cases) is triggered by a single or set of life circumstances. While counselling can help some people, I feel it is less commonly used in places like the UK than somewhere like the US where it is more mainstream. Counselling helps because it adds clarity to something or allows you to tackle something head on. Medication kind of just blocks the chemicals (in the simplest terms possible).

The fact of that matter is none of them change your circumstances. People who are depressed from being lonely and isolated don’t get friends and family from either solution. People don’t forget their traumas. I guess my question is, how does any of it help?

Sure you can block the chemicals. But none of them are essentially a solution to the root problem right? What’s it like to live with the problem there, knowing it exists, but theres just a magic invisible wall keeping the chemicals in balance to moderate your feeling? 

What treatment solutions have enabled you to tackle root causes head on? Especially for things like isolation and loneliness where it is not necessarily your decision to remove yourself from that situation. It is very much other people who have that choice. 

Moreover, how do you ever trust what you feel? How do you tell the difference between a true gut feeling and something that is limited or altered by chemical regulation?

Sorry if these are stupid and/or weird questions."
2424,I wish I never existed,Instead I am forced to be alive. It’s so painful and exhausting just to wake up in the morning. I just want to stop existing.
2425,Problem fixing problems and emotions,"I just have a problem fixing my problems. For example if im arguing w my partner and it gets really bad i feel like i cant do anything or fix it so i feel really overwhelmed with anxiety and sadness that i always resort to suicidal ideation. Im tired of this. I am going to therapy i was diagnosed with major depression but its trippy to notice this about myself and it feels like i cant do anything to stop it. I am making progress and i dont self harm anymore i try alot of coping strategies but i wish i could just stop thinking like this. Im at a point where i believe i dont even fear death. Man, the brain is so complicated"
2426,My life isn't going to well,"Just need to vent a bit because all of this has just built up in my heart during the past couple of years and I don't really have anyone who cares enough to tell it to.

1. In high school I dated what people would say was the most popular and perfect boy ever. He modeled for multiple magazines, was quarterback of the football team, smartest kid in school, almost in every varsity sport by sophomore year and somehow he managed to fall in love with me despite the fact that there are so many other pretty girls at my school. When this happened everyone at school was pretty shocked bc I was basically that one girl who would spend lunch with the teacher and work on homework, aka a nerd. I was thankful for him, but I didn't date him bc he was a pretty boy, he treated me like absolute royalty. Anyways we started dating in eight grade and he asked me what one of my dreams were in life, and I told him that I'd like to qualify for the USA Junior Olympics one day, it was a pretty big dream, and I kind of said it jokingly but he replied by saying ""Okay then, I guess we'll make it happen."" For 5 years (until my senior year of high school) my boyfriend would train me every single day for hours. He would push me non-stop and we never missed a day of training, even on holidays. I never thought I would have the potential to be anywhere near as fast to qualify for the Junior Olympics but eventually I made my way into my high school varsity track team and from there he kept helping me improve. Eventually I qualified for the National Junior Olympics Championships and was getting ready to compete in my first race. About two days before my first race, I went to the field to practice for my race and as I was running, out of nowhere, a group of girls grabbed me, took me behind the bleachers, and one of the girls took a hammer and shattered both of my knees. They ran away and after yelling in agony for a while someone eventually heard me, called 911, and I went to the ER and had surgery. I never knew why it happened until after a couple weeks of coming back to school my best friend, my absolute ride or die that I had known since second grade came up to me and said ""I have to tell you something since I feel so guilty. I knew what (insert the name of the girl who broke my knees) was going to do to you and I didn't bother telling you or trying to stop them. (The girl's name) had a crush on your boyfriend for the past 5 years and couldn't stand to see you together. She was going to poison you during lunch, but I told her to not do something so extreme so I guess she settled for breaking your knees."" I just choked up. So much for a lifelong friend huh? I haven't been able to play any sports ever since then and can't even try out for my college sports teams. My running/sports career ended right then and there. I didn't even get to compete in my first Junior Olympic race that I had worked 5 whole years for.

3. Dated another boy, we were madly on love. About a year into dating he died by overdosing on drugs. God I miss him so much.

4. Got into surfing as a method of physical therapy after my knee injury. One day I stayed out surfing a little too late and I couldn't make it back to my car since it was pitch black and the flashlight on my phone didn't work. I saw a flashlight in the distance since someone seemed to be hiking on the nearby trails and shouted for help to see if the person with the flashlight could help me find my way back to my car. It was a long walk back and we made some small talk but before I knew it this guy grabbed my wrists and pulled my bikini bottoms down and raped me. 

5. I kind of lost hope in love at that point. I had just been through too much, but then came along this boy. I met him in class one day and we sort of clicked. We dated for a year and a half and planned so may secret trips together. We went to a different state and different country together during college without anyone knowing and would always go camping while stargazing and just talk about life. Prior to dating him I told him that I wanted to wait until marriage to have sex (since I've had a pretty traumatic past) and he said that it was fine with him and that he was willing to wait for me. I never told him I was raped btw. Anyways we would always talk about our future, how many kids we'd want, what we'd name them, how we would raise them, and he eventually gave me a promise ring saying that he would marry me in two years after we graduated (I know kind of early to be talking about this in college but we were both madly in love and had done pretty much everything together). One day I went down to my college market and sat by the counter working on an essay for class. All of a sudden I heard a student worker there talking to her friend and said ""Yeah, (insert my boyfriend's name) and I had the best sex last night. We did three rounds. One round down by the beach on the sand right next to the waves. One at the local park a few blocks down. And then we went back to his dorm and did a third round. We also went on a second date a week later and had sex in the history museum."" My boyfriend has a very very unique name but I acted oblivious and told myself that she was talking about another guy. Then this girl said that they were planning on going on a third date on Saturday night at (insert location name). I'm not one to invade on anyone's privacy but if the guy who said he was gonna marry me was hooking up with another girl, I wanted to know. So being the idiot I am, I go to this exact place at night and lo and behold I see my boyfriend having sex with another girl out in a hidden place in public. They were having such a good time and laughing, my heart just shattered. I didn't bring it up to him until about three weeks later and he responded by saying that he was sorry and that he had no feelings for the girl at all, but that he just really wanted to have sex with someone. I was so heartbroken. How do you tell someone you're in love with them and want to marry them but then go off and do something like that? 

This has all built up in my heart lately and I just needed to vent I guess. I feel so broken. I know people have it a lot worse than me but I guess it feels good to type it all out anonymously."
2427,Seeing passionate people makes me feel bad,"Whenever I watch films that people do everything and anything to reach a goal, inspirationl or motivational vids where they have nothing and then became something because they loved their craft. Like where do you guys get that? How do you do that? How do you find that? Why cant I have that? It's something I've always wanted but could never have."
2428,Admitting myself alone to the hospital,"I think I need this, I’m going to go to school as usual, try my best to make it out the morning. Wait till lunch, then get the money I barely have for a bus ticket to the hospital and admit myself. This is really big for me but I can’t do it anymore. I’m young ( f16) but I don’t trust anyone around me to help me and I’m at a point where its hard to help myself and coping mechanisms haven’t worked in a few months. I’ve started to think about suicide for the last month, but I always have a part in me that says I’m just a drama queen. I just want a fucking coma, a fucking break, no feelings, no trauma, no fucking intrusive thoughts. I can’t kill myself even though a part of me wants to so so much, I can’t for my dog and stuffed animals. I can’t trust anyone around me with my problems and mental issues so I prefer “help”  from professionals or under anonymity (thank you so much reddit). I don’t know if the hospital will help me but its worth a try"
2429,How do you guys get through?,"When you feel like shit and all you want to do is die, what pulls you back from the edge? I’m just interested in other people’s answers. Personally, I tell myself that I’ve made it through 100 percent of my bad days and I’ve put in too much effort to give up now. That wouldn’t be fair to past me to let it all go to waste"
2430,I don’t see the point,"I don’t see the purpose of anything. I am so isolated and alone. I have ruined every relationship in my life because I don’t know how to control my temper I get so frustrated and I’m extremely misunderstood. I don’t want to be here anymore I just don’t get it.  I dropped out of college, I can’t afford anything I can barely get myself out of bed."
2431,I want to cut again.,The urge to cut is so strong right now I can’t resist. My step daughter tells me I do nothing but yell. My husband tells me I do nothing but yell. Honestly they would be better without me in this world. All I do is make everyone miserable. I’ve been been married for 7 months and my husband has lost interest in me.
2432,One more thing,"Posted the other day how I felt lonely and isolated...my fiancé left me today. When it rains, it pours"
2433,How do I get over depression when I have little to no support.,"I know why I'm depressed, I've been to a therapist. I guess my question is how do I get back to myself when no one cares about me, at least no one shows it. I never get calls seeing how I am from family. Never have visitors.

I'm just rambling at this point, but I just want one person in my family to call or text to ask how I'm doing, just one. For 1 second I want to feel like I'm not an outcast. I never did anything to feel like this."
2435,The monotony and tedium of life is so over whelming.,"Go to work. Come home. Go out for drinks with friends. Come home. Maybe tinker with some hobbies. Watch TV. 

The only thing that made life worthwhile was my relationship that I pissed down the drain due to my depression. I would isolate myself and she got tired of.

Really this is it? I don't want to live anymore. It's just all too tiring. 

I don't even see the big deal with not wanting to live anymore. We all die. Why struggle for 40+ more years going to work and coming home."
2436,end me,"ive had suicidal thoughts for 3-4 years now. I want to die but im a fucking coward. my life is monotonous. i dont fucking care if i die, but im still scared. 

i am loved and cared for but i dont feel like it. i just want to be at peace."
2438,I don't know what to do anymore.,"My brother told me to kill myself a few days ago. I told my mom that I couldn't continue supporting her and my brother told me I was better off dead... I pulled my mom off the streets over a year ago and my depression continued to mount until I told my fiance I couldn't handle going to work anymore. And so, with us moving into a much smaller place I offered to move my mom anywhere she wanted to go and she got upset. She told me I didnt want her anymore and she called my brother and here I am. My fiance works nights and I never see him awake and I dont really have anyone to talk to. I feel like I'm a ghost half the time. Kinda bumbling through life without any meaning and it's hard to want to continue like this. It's easier to think about not being here anymore. Yes, I know the suicide hotline is there, but I feel like that's giving into that side of myself. I'm about to loose everything I have. Please, if anyone has any advice I need it. Anyone ever started over? Successfully let the closest parts of there family go? Where do I go from here? I feel so lost."
2439,Why won’t my depression just leave me alone?,I can never enjoy anything. That feeling of being numb and empty is always there. It can be the most exciting moment of my life and I would still feel nothing.
2440,Cya,I feel like i wont be here after someday this week. I just can't take this fogginess and negativity in my head everyday. I wasted my life and it's my fault. I have no friends in school. I get bullied in school and my own brother bullies me. I feel like no one would care if i wasnt here. No one asks how i feel ever. I hate myself too much. I'm 17 right now and i don't want to feel this anymore.
2441,i want to kill myself,thats it i want to kill myself i have sad life any advice ?
2442,Break up,Hey guys I just wanna talk about my break up so I’ve been with my ex for around 2.5 years and about a month ago we broke up and it’s honestly hurt me so bad I’ve done around 30 capsules of mdma in less than two months and I don’t do anything besides stay home and recently she had found a new boyfriend which broke me even more and made me suicidal and idk what to do anymore.
2443,Started self harming again. I hate myself so fucking much.,"So last Sunday I kind of hit an emotional rock bottom and started self harming, I had not self harmed for over a year at that point. Over the week things got gradually better, I saw my therapist who put things into perspective and little by little I started feeling better about myself.

But life and the universe seemingly had other plans for me because I immediately started self harming again after I got into an argument with my uncle and my mom tonight. I don't want to get into what the argument was about but it was over a topic that I feel particularly strong about and the absolutely bugnuts fucking stupid thing was that my uncle and my mom didn't even disagree with me, I just felt like they didn't quite understand what I was saying and were also making little of the subject, not taking it, and by extension me, seriously. Which is something I've been insecure about pretty much my whole life, I very often feel like people don't take me seriously and I sometimes feel like people are openly mocking me. 

I felt so bad after the argument that I retreated into the kitchen and started violently punching myself in the head with my fists. My head hurts like hell right now and my hands are all black and blue. I fucking hate myself so fucking much, I should never argue with anyone about anything ever because I'm too fucking stupid to discuss anything. I wish someone would finally get so pissed off with me that they would just beat me to a bloody pulp and then throw my unconscious body in the sea. I wish that car had run over me and left me for dead when I crossed the street when I went to the store 20 minutes ago. I wish a crazed serial killer with a power drill would break into my home and drill a hole clean through my head. I wish a small time criminal would shoot me in the head as an innocent bystander in a robbery gone wrong. I wish a terrorist would kidnap me and behead me with a chainsaw on video. No one would miss me anyway."
2444,Depression sucks.,"I normally hate Tinder. I was super lonely and depressed, so I downloaded it again. I am literally talking with a 10, and she is super nice, and seems really sweet. I'm getting over being sick, so we can't meet just yet, but she gave m her phone number, and we are still texting. 

But somehow all I can think is that she is way too good for me, and can't actually be interested in me. Why can't I just enjoy the fact that someone actually wants to talk to me...."
2445,Just at the job alone talking to myself like I always do,Slightly drunk and walking around the building talking to myself. I've been talking to myself over 7 years. It's the only thing I like to do because it's zero effort.
2446,"Feeling numb and empty, I lost interest in pretty much everything","I'm 19 yo dude, and I can say I have wasted my entire life so far. I do nothing all day and I dont even know what to do. Every time, around this time of the year, I find myself in the same spot. I didnt do anything of great value at all, nothing i can be proud of. And it gets to me all the time, but i brush it off by listening to some music and playing games or whatever. It's like a coping mechanism, but i am done with it .

It's the same vicious cycle all the time: feel like shit so i dont have the motivation to do anything, but then i feel like shit again because i didnt do anything all day.
I am in a state where i dont feel happy or sad anymore. I dont really feel anything. I am just bored. I am not even living life at this point, I'm avoiding it. I have been thinking about putting an end to it but i keep hoping i will come to my senses, or find something that will get me interested in life again. 

I dont know if i'm depressed or not, never really been diagnosed or went to a doctor about it, and to be honest i dont think anyone cares. Also, this is a bit long sorry, but i wanted to get some things off my chest."
2447,Really nothing,"So, it's my second post there. It was 9 months ago, I think.. and nothing has really changed since then. I've got into uni, moved to another city but now there are just more problems there it was before. 
I didn't have good classmates and I hoped for groupmates at uni to be nice. I've tried many ways to establish some kind of connection with them, I tried to get to meet other people at uni, nothing has worked out.
I have some problems with studying as it's hard for me to concentrate and pay attention to things. And I'm having exams this week, idk how I'll get through this.
I went to psychologist for 2 months, but it's quite expensive as my parents would never support me in this kind of situation. They would just say (I tried to convince them that I had to go to physiologist 3 years ago): you're making up everything.
Christmas and New Year are coming up and I hate them. As well as other holidays. I just said my parents that I'd spend this time with groupmates in order not to get back to hometown. I don't have the bond with parents, they don't understand me and they're too homophobic, unfortunately. (I'm from Russia)
I have literally no friends. I thought I had one. And this guy was (and still is) my love. But, actually, he is always treating me like some garbage. And I forgive him because I have no one else to talk to. I tried to go to gay bars, meet on dating sites. No one just wants to be close to me, even as friends.
I trust this guy the most, he's everything to me, but, I do suffer because he's so intractable and emotionless. I help him every time he needs as I want him to be the happiest person in the world.
I'm so tired of everything. I don't enjoy listening to music, learning languages, watching videos, playing games. Nothing brings me pleasure, only boredom and will to do something with my life (in a bad way).
I'm not looking for help, just trying to get this hell out of me. And, to be honest, it doesn't help me. Just want to cry 24/7."
2448,You know what sucks,"It sucks to have to cry myself to sleep every ff night because I feel alone and like no one even cares if I’m here or not 
It sucks to feel worthless 
It sucks to be the person I hate the most
It sucks being alive and it sucks wanting to die 
Everything just suck and I hate it and I want it to stop but it won’t and i make everything worse 
And worse until I just can’t do it anymore I can’t be pretent to be happy and cheery all the time and it sucks to know I’m falling apart and I don’t know what to do about it"
2449,I witnessed the results of a suicide,"In 2015 I lived with roommates who were much older than myself.  I was so desperate to get out of my parents house at 26 I lived with 2 40 yr olds, one with a visiting son. The visiting son was 16, and the father, my roommate was also trying to juggle work and a dating life. 

So the two 40 yr old men were part of a community of LARPERS full with costumes and weekend getaways. They played magic the gathering, watched LOTR and geeked out. Even though the son would be going along with them on these trips, there were days the adults had to leave him home. Of course, I would take the time to also play video games with the son when the adults were busy.he was a nice kid, we got along.

In my life, I was going through the worst phase of depression I experienced in my life. I was working at a place that demanded a lot from me and had treated me terribly. I was fighting with the boyfriend at the time constantly, and I tried to continue college. 

It all fell apart once the semester was over. I had issues with staying late at work, and getting to class late or missing lecture entirely. I couldn't get lab work/ homework done cuz I was wiped out at the end of the day from actual work. Meanwhile I tried keeping my relationship going, and just gave up on studying to save it. The pressure I had from my parents to succeed in school, and in life in general was so intense. They also hated my living situation so it was a constant fight for approval. 

End of the year, I failed the semester, my relationship was on the rocks, and my roommates became real with me and we had a few arguments ourselves. 

January one night, I am woken by my phone continuously going off. I am by myself in the house, and it was a Larping weekend. My roommates son killed himself. Found hanging in his mother's kitchen and the chair didnt move. 

Needless to say that was a horrible night.

The funeral was amazing. I had never seen so many people before. Because, his family, friends, classmates, and the LARPING community filled the entire place. It was devastating to his father, my boyfriend, and his mother. I don't know which sight was worse, his destroyed father, or his casket. 

But if only this kid spoke to someone, anyone about what he was going through.. maybe it would have saved him. Someone would have said the right thing to show that someone cared. And so many people did. He affected so many lives. And he wasn't even around to see all that love for him. 

I did go into a depression myself, and had believed for a few days that he had the solution. my brain had made me believe no one would come to my funeral, cuz no one would be told about it. No one would care enough. 

Until I did the most loving thing for myself, and took the time to see a psychiatrist and therapist. It saved my life. Because no one could care about me more than myself. And after taking the time to give up the need for approval and the idea failure was all my fault, it helped to see the bigger picture. 

There is a future. And it can be how I make it. I will find the right people to care with me. The toxic relationships and dead weight are off my shoulders.

It disheartens me to read so many suicide stories here. You have no idea who you will effect. Because even though they don't always say it of show it, there are people who care. And self care and self love is the only way to start digging yourself out of that ditch"
2450,I'm starting an IOP (intensive outpatient program) on Wednesday and I'm so nervous,"I see a therapist weekly and have been since the start of this year, but it's just not enough anymore. I have CPTSD and depression, and it's getting so hard to deal with the depression, especially around the holidays. I'm starting on Wednesday and I'll be going three hours a day, three days a week, for a month. I really hope it helps, but I'm so scared I'm going to mess it up. I'm really good at that.

I hope it teaches me some useful skills and makes me less passively suicidal all of the time. 

Have any of y'all done an IOP?"
2452,I want to kill myself after christmas,"I don't know. I can't do this, I don't know what's wrong with me. I fail at everything I do, really basic stuff. I'm just not capable of living in this world and I'm tired of fumbling around trying to get better and getting shot down everytime. I don't see things changing in the future, I only see myself dealing with this forever.

I don't even think it's worth explaining anymore. I feel happy now that I know I only have to live for a couple of weeks."
2453,my life feels like its coming to a crash,"i feel like i'm drowning, like i'm suffocating. every single fucking day. it's been like this for months without stop, and i'm just so tired. i feel like i can't breathe.

i know i need to get help. i know i do. but i feel trapped. 

i can't. i can't bring myself to get help. 

i've tried ending my life 3 times this month but every time i did, i just failed miserably. 

i'm in so much pain, and it all just fucking hurts so much. i just want to numb the pain, and i want to be done with it. i'm so tired of suffering.

i've been depressed for 5 years. people always say that things will get better, but it hasn't. 

it's just gotten worse and worse and i feel like i've hit my breaking point. 

i don't want to do this anymore. i can't do this anymore. i just want it all to fucking end. please. god. someone just end my misery. please."
2454,Why do I have to be alive?,I don’t see the point in living. Being alive is painful and exhausting. It’s not like I asked to be born.
2455,I'm a family man now..but this isn't how I pictured my life,"I have 3 beautiful boys and a loving gf who puts up with my anger and hatred that I have for many things in this world. I feel hopeless.. I'm 28 and see a lot of people that I used to hang out with and be friends with that are going out and doing these amazing things and I'm forced to work and be a provider, I never knew my dad as he walked out of my life. I'm sad and it feels as if I'll never be excited or happy or content but I know I should be, my family is wonderful and i love them all but why do i feel like this? I feel like a corporate slave who has nothing going for him, I was going to school and producing music but now neither of those are happening, I feel stuck, is this just my imagination? What is this? Why does it feel like I'm working so much and gaining so little?"
2456,Death,To be honest. I really fucking crave it. It makes me feel better. Thinking about dying helps me lmao...... Kill me pls. I cant anymore. I feel so empty. I have lost my soul. I want to feel the relieve of death. Pls help.
2457,It's like I never lived my adolescence.,"People get emotionally connected to others, they have sex, they hug, they kiss while I feel like a Terminator. Except I am not a badass like those machines but a vulnerable, unmotivated piece of shit. Just another rant about my existence, sorry guys."
2459,I don’t know anymore,"I feel lonely. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel like I have nobody. I want to make friends in school but no one notices me or talk to me they just brush me off. I want to be their friends but they don’t give any efforts when I give all my efforts. I feel like the friends I have right now don’t even care for me. They always say why the fuck are u always depress you should be happy and always saying like the worst thing to me. I tried to hide my depression in hopes for them to stay with me but it’s just too much at this point I’ve been doing this for year. I’m not even allowed to get a therapist because my parents won’t let me. My parents don’t care. Nobody cares and yet I try to be happy for all those people it just gets tired ya know faking being happy and faking everything is alright but It isn’t. 

  I try to be there for people. When they need help but they don’t do the same for me when I do act depressed or something they get mad at me like what do you want me to do. I can’t keep this all in it’s too much for me I have to let it out. I feel like no one understands me. I feel like no one would miss me. Is it wrong for me to be jealous towards the people that have friends that care for them. My parents don’t even help. They just say mean stuff to me and break my mental or just physically abuse me. I just don’t know maybe I should give up and let everything out."
2460,SCREAM,"I just made this to let out how I feel and just put my thoughts into something other than my own head. I don't know, I just graduated high school and went to a big school across the country because I didn't know what else to do. All these people just say go to college go to college its fun, its the next step. It's the next step if you're cool with wasting four years ""learning"".  Every person here seems to not give much of a fuck about anything, forming relationships, figuring shit out, i don't know maybe i'm just bugging the fuck out. I want to do more, I want to see more, and I want to be more. This isn't the next step if anything this has shown me what I don't want to be. I lost a lot of people in the past couple months to this stupid college shit so at this point I don't even know what to look forward too. I just want to be better and find what I'm good at. Meet people who care, who are into being more than another robot. I'm just loosely ranting bull shit but I'd rather be doing this then studying for a stupid final that is in my opinion, worthless."
2461,Fuck this shit,"Literally fuck this shit, fuck my life, fuck everything, I’m done. It’s over. I hate this so much, having to live this hell is so stupid, I don’t care anymore."
2462,Advice please.,"Since I dont have anyone to talk to I signed up for E-mail lifeline support. Its been over a month now and nothings changed if not gotten worse. At this point I feel like the person is just doing that with me because they are obliged to. But seriously, what should I do. Got any tips?"
2463,"7 months ago I told myself ""it litterally can't get any worse than this"" and holy shit, it could get a lot worse and it did","Every time I hit rock bottom I start spiraling down lower than I have ever been, it's unbelievable, there's absolutely no mercy, I keep sinking and sinking and it never stops, why me, why anyone, I   wish people could understand how fucking debilitating depression is, I'm so fucking angry but I cant do anything about it because I can barely move from my bed without collapsing physically and mentally. 

Where do you guys see yourself in like 10 years? I'm in my late teens, becoming an adult has only made my situation worse because now It's time that I stop leeching off of my parents but I dont have the life force to get a job or finish my education. I see friends from middle school getting their diplomas, some of them are in Uni already, one of my childhood friends is working full time and loves his job, but where am I? I couldn't finish highschool because I have a plethora of fucking mental illnesses which make studying an actual physical nightmare, like what the fuck do I even do? Become homeless, that's what I'll do, that's my only prospect in life, other than downing meds and suffocating myself with a plastic bag, being alive is nothing but torment and agony.

Sorry for the venting, feel free to ignore."
2464,:(,I want to blow my brains out to see what killing myself feels like.. does it feel good..?
2465,"I truly feel inadequate.. I have the belief that not having, or not be able to have a girlfriend, partner or just friends is the true sign of a failure as a member of human mankind.. I truly feel I’m not right, I feel useless for those reasons.. I’m living just because I had to.. any help?",Any help to elaborate this belief I suspect is not right but I cannot help resolving it and it is procuring me lot of pain .. ty everyone
2466,Does anyone have any experience with microdosing?,"Two years ago I took shrooms and had an amazing experience. My depression and anxiety almost conpletely disappeared for a month and I felt like a... giant shift in the core of my being, I suffer from a speech impediment, I stutter semi-severely and I have all sorts of issues with anxiety because of it, I've been seeing speech therapists my whole life and nothing helped much but after this shroom trip my speech got so much better. All in all, a wonderful experience, I felt better but didn't think that it was maybe because of the shrooms. It's not for everyone, I never try to talk people into taking them. If you're in a semi bad place in life, it could be horrifying if you're not in touch with yourself. I was in a...not that bad period of my life back then and it seemed to only boost me further. Then, after a month or two my regular depression, GAD and speech issues and everything just started coming back slowly. I didn't even think about taking psilocybin that soon again cause the first experience I had was so good that I didn't want to ruin it, I just kinda forgot about it

Two years have passed, I'm 23 now, lots of shit good and bad happened to me, I was on and off valium and xanax .. and I really don't want to go back on antidepressants, I was on meds from ages 16-20 and I'm done with it

Currently I've never felt more lost in my life, I'm unemployed, without a college degree, my life kind of fell apart. I do have a boyfriend and a family and good friends but I am so terribly lost that I can't even describe it. I don't want to drink alcohol anymore and get drunk every weekend just to feel numb

Been in therapy this summer, I'm trying really hard to do something about my depression and now I've been looking up microdosing and I seriously want to try it. This time, with my full attention on dealing with my issues and reprograming my brain and boosting my productivity. I feel frozen and like I'm stuck in a hole I can't get out of. So does anyone in this thread have any experience with microdosing? Did it help with depression specifically, what are your experiences..?"
2467,How to care for personal hygiene while in a depressive episode?,Would like to know if anyone have any tips; I haven't showered all day and haven't brushed my teeth since yesterday and I just can't bring meself to do these things when I'm feeling this depressed. Does anyone have any strategy to continue to take care of theirselves even though they're feeling suicidal? Thank you so much.
2468,My family doesn’t feel like home,"The older I’ve gotten, the less I have come to care about my family. I think everyone as a kid knows they love their family cause that’s their family, but when I realized what love actually meant then I realized maybe I don’t actually love them. Or maybe I don’t know what love really is. I feel very disconnected from my family and I am very much the black sheep of the group and I do not get along with them at all. I still live with my mom (I just turned 19), and I feel like I live with a stranger. Albeit, she did have me when she was 40, and my brother was already 20 at the time, so there is very large age gaps between me and them. We don’t really have anything in common, I don’t like spending time with her, and she makes me feel guilty for not liking my bother or father. My father left when I was around 2, and didn’t care much about me growing up so I don’t know him or love him and she gets upset by that because he’s my dad. My brother was always really mean to me as a kid and made me feel bad about myself and I always witnessed him and my mom arguing and fighting when I was little, so I don’t like him either. He is just a very mean and hateful person. I would never talk to him again if I could. I always felt ignored by my mom when I was a kid because she wouldn’t pay attention to me and instead would help other people or read books and never play with me. So, I’ve always been independent for the most part. Half the time I don’t even know why I’m here or if I even really exist. Is it bad I feel these things? It’s different with my friends because I know I love them and I would help them in any ways I could, but even with them sometimes I feel like maybe I don’t really love them like I should. But I definitely do not feel connected to my family at all and I wish I would’ve gone away for college to get away from them."
2469,I'm disgusted with myself,"I just have to write that. I don't expect you to write back or try to make me feel better. 

I'm disgusted with myself and no-one knows that. I feel bad looking at myself in the mirror every morning. I feel bad thinking about everything connected with me. 

I blame myself for every bad or negative thing happening around me. 

For friends and family I'm an open, extrovert, happy, easy going person. I engage in charity events, I work with kids with cancer, support local events. I have a normal job, group of friends I'm just a regular guy which you meet on a streets.

Because of all I've done, people I meet say things like ""You're such a good human"", ""I'm proud of you"", ""I want to be like you"".

That makes me feel even worse. Why? Because in my mind I'm so useless, that I feel bad for them to not know that. I do more and more stuff to calm the voices and feelings but that doesn't help. 

I don't want to commit suicide, dont worry. This lasts for like 10 years and I'm still here ;) Just wanted to tell someone about that.

I'm not going to go to see the doctor. Maybe one day I'll manage to help myself. For now I'll be the same person, helping others. Maybe their lives will be happier than mine.

Cheers!"
2470,I Need Help,"Disclaimer:This is a throwaway account....I need help in whether ir not I am epressed or not. I just turned 15 friday and since about august of 2018 I have felt deifferent towards, well everything. I hate myself and everything aeoind me. Whenever something goes wrong my first thought is suicide and whether or not that is the best option. Looking in the mirror is now saddening seeing as it reminds me of me. I have never claimed to be depressed and dont want to just incase this is normal hormones and is something every teem goes through. I dont wanna tell my parents becuase the only time they have ever caught wind of how Ifelt was in 5th grade when I serious withdraw symptoms from my medication and told my friend I was going to off myself who then tild the school who told my parents and when they found out, they yelled at me. They alos tell me to ""man up""eveytime thehy even suspect I cried or are crying. I knoe people go through much worse than this andI dont wanna desensitive anyones experience if this is normal, so I really wanna know is this normal because it is bugging me."
2471,I just want to be normal,"I don’t get it. People my age are doing better than me. Even those who are “depressed” appear to have a tough attitude to them. I’m so weak and pathetic-yesterday I got jealous because my friend was able to become friends with my crush. I’m freaking 26 and mentally I understand it...but emotionally I’m a wreck. I don’t get it. I’ve taken weed, phenibut, Kratom, lsd, mushrooms, deep breathing, guided meditation and I’m still this way. Emotionally inside I can feel it. I lost my friends my age because of my reputation (I always blacked out and created issues). My friends almost didn’t invite me to Electric Forest because they thought I was going to be a problem (I wasn’t-in fact I was the most alive and real I had ever been and in fact I caused 0 problems on drugs).
I’m not a veteran, but I did do basic and some OSUT. I feel like I can’t relate to civilians nor military folk. The one person I cared about the most other than my immediate family is no longer in my life. I’ve lost people to death, drugs, and because of my pathetic attempts to get EVERY. SINGLE. GIRL. This endless chase basically led me to legal issues and my ongoing depression that doesn’t go away. Every time I read some self help guide, I can’t help but to just see how fake it all is. I was in a pyramid scheme before so all of those self help was shoved down my throat. I can recite it back but because my dreams were destroyed by them, I can’t find anything genuine anymore. I lost my dreams of becoming a music teacher-in fact I’ve realized it was all a waste of time. All I do is work at a full time job that is clerical, hit the gym, smoke weed, and sometimes I’ll go out (and even then I’m always to the side, all awkward and shy and pathetic).
Please. If there’s any hope, any guides anything that can help even the most stubborn-I’ll take it. I want my innocence back-I want my hope to return. But now all I see is that nobody really knows what they’re doing, and we’re all just a fucking number.
I failed my final semester of college because I gave up but I was allowed to walk. Sitting with everyone was a real eye opener-everyone’s hammered, my family got seats behind the event but got to see it on a tv...which meant they didn’t have to come out since it was all on a giant tv. Everyone was done, everything was fake. The speaker, the class president-they’re all fake and they all sounded as if they’re going to do great amazing things. Buzzwords after countless buzzwords. I’m losing my mind."
2472,I think I will snap one day,"I try my best almost everyday to not break down crying or give in to my depression/anxiety. There's constant a pressure on my head. I feel like in the back of my stressed mind, I will end up going on a rambling and incoherent rant and give up on everything."
2473,Fighting to stay positive,"Things are good,  Im engaged, I live in nice home, in a few weeks I will be celebrating the holidays with my large extended family and my grandmother who is 95. But Im sad, I just want to sleep, I feel so lonely, everything is overwhelming. Im fighting so hard to practice gratitude and change my thoughts but this bout of depression is really hard. The older I get the harder it gets to get out of these spells. I started zoloft 3 days ago, so hopefully I will be better soon."
2474,Im so confused...do i have depression?,"First off i want to tell you that im a 50 y.o. black male living in a ""white town"" in canada. I feel i have to say that just to lay the groundwork of what im going through. Ive always had low self esteem, but have been told that im handsome and or cute, even though i absolutely hate looking in the mirror. Im sure a ton of my issues stem from that my father was never around, and because of that i dont handle rejection very well
Ive always been extremely anxious in crowds and have alot of anxiety. The thing is, by nature i think im an introvert and absolutely am terrified of rejection. But on the other hand i can be the class clown and be extremely outgoing when im around friends, but not so much when im with family. Just typing this, there is so muchgoing on in.my head...its almost like i have 2 personalities. I can be extremely loving and in the same breath extremely hateful. I honestly cant figure out what my deal is. 
And now to top it off...my gf and i have been fighting, and when im mad, its... im right everything i do for u ...f this im outta here, i dont need this( i live with her and her 2 kids) i do everything for this lady, but i think because of my low self esteem, im extremely sensative, so i tend to take things extremely hard, especially if there negative towards me. The other day she actually said to me that i smell, not b.o. but just smell. I tried to listen to her and was thinking maybe i eat too much garlic or somethibg lol, but to be honest ever sibce she said that ive pulled back, and now have made things worse by doing erratic things such as just leaving to be by myself and now, i have spent this entire weekend in the master bedroom in this 4br house. I ve always felt comfortable living in a small space. Needless to say this has made things 10x worse with my partner. Now i just want to turn the lights off and just tunnell under the covers in my bed. I think i may suffer some sort of depression...i have a ton of anxiety, and now sadly by the way ive acted, im pretty sure my gf is done with me....i dont know what to do....any guidance is appreciated :("
2475,I hate everything about myself. What now?,"I'm sure almost everyone in this subreddit gets what I'm saying without me having to explain it.

But does anyone know a good coping mechanisms for this, even if it's just a efficient strategy to run from myself?"
2476,i'm a mess,"i'm so embarrassed to even confess this but i haven't showered in 3 months because of my ocd and depression. i can only shower when i have vacuumed the whole house because it makes me feel like the whole house is clean and i can take a shower without coming out of the shower to dirty floors, my parents do not understand this too and have absolutely no respect for their own house and keeping it clean. my parents just let the dogs run around the house and let them dirty the floors and jump on the beds when i'm the only one telling them to get off to keep the house clean but they don't care, they just laugh at me and it makes me really really angry, the house has become so dirty that i just don't have the energy or motivation to clean it and cleaning the house is the only way i can shower. i really hate living here, ive wanted to book a night in a hotel just to shower because i can't stand living here when the house is this dirty but my parents dont do anything about it and i can't do it, i just can't. i'm so weak all the time and don't worry, i've washed my hair a couple of times over the bathtub but i haven't washed my hair in 3 weeks now. i'm also dealing with a very bad stomach from acid reflux, i have a endoscopy tomorrow but i want to cancel it because i'm embarrassed to go into the hospital because i feel so dirty, my legs are so hairy and i have dead skin all over my body, my hair is so greasy and i feel disgusting, so i want to cancel the appointment until i shower and reschedule it but i know i need it. my sleep schedule is also really messed up, it's always been like this since i was young but lately it's been very bad. i will go to bed at 8 or 9 am and wake up at the 9 pm at night... basically just wasting my life away. i'm so fucking lonely too and i just lost my ''boyfriend'' too who was just leading me on the whole time telling me that he loved me when he never really did and i miss him more than anything. he was my best friend and my only friend now i have no one. i really don't know what i'm doing with my life anymore, i have no friends, i never did even whe i was young, i was always a loner in school and found it really difficult to make friends, i had one good friend but she moved country to study and i've completely lost her, i follow her on instagram and i when i see her living her life and smiling, it makes me so happy to see her face and see her smiling and doing good but i miss her but i can't bring myself to text her and tell her i'm sorry for never talking to her because of my depression. i'm a disappoint to my parents aswell and i know they just want the best for me and tell me to go and get a job everyday but i physically can't. i'm 27 and i've never had a job, i don't have a proper education too all because of my anxiety and depression but yet my parents still refuse to see that and don't even believe me at times and yes, i'm 27 and still live with my parents because i'm a loser, the funny thing is i dont feel my age, in my head i still feel like i'm 19 years old and my friend seems to think this is because my development has been stunted from isolation and i can see why.  i just spend all night on the computer and playing video games then sleep all day and repeat because playing video games and being on the computer helps me escape from the reality of what my life really is, when i get off at night to go to bed eventually, i'm faced with the reality again and start to cry. every fucking night, i just cry myself to sleep. my eating is very bad too, i only eat one meal a day and thats it because i'm never hungry, i had a eating disorder when i was around 14 but it ended quickly because i like to believe i have a strong will power to quit things easily just like i did when i quit smoking, it didn't take me long to quit. i only leave my house like once a week to collect my welfare money and then go home again, it's always been like this for about 12 years now. i have anti depressants but i'm too scared to take them because i hate the side effects and i'm a really big hypochondriac too. i just really dont know what to do anymore, i'm really sorry for complaining. i sound so pathetic."
2477,"Help me, I can’t find the way out of my dark pit of despair.","I feel trapped in an endless loop of self hatred. I can’t figure out how to break it. I feel like im getting dumber by the day and that I ruined my brain with drug use. I used to show so much potential when I was studying to be a pilot but that dream is gone now. Ive been to the hospital more times than I can count for my suicidal ideations and my relationship with both my parents are very rocky. Even my sister doesnt give a shit about me. I just dig myself in a deeper hole whenever I think of how much of a burden I am on everyone around me. I am alone in this world, ive never been in a relationship and all my friends are in one, I dont even know of any girl who’s ever so much as found me “cute”. My existence is pitiful at best. I can’t be happy, I dont even remember what that feels like. Ive been on 3 different antidepressants now and I still feel like shit. Nothing helps. No matter what people say I know ill always see myself in a horrible light. People try to comfort me but I only agree with them to get them off my case. I have no steady flow of income and I waste my days away smoking weed and playing gta. I can’t speak coherently anymore, I can’t hold a conversation and I find it easiest to express myself in writing. So im asking for help from people who have been in my shoes. I have nothing to live for, no money to my name, no relationships, nothing. I know itll just be easier on everyone if I just off myself but I can’t find the courage to go through. Ive attempted suicide twice now and my wrist is permanently scarred from the cutting ive done. Ive stopped that but even a year and a half later I feel desperate to pick up another razor... even worse is that even though I dont want to, I make my depression everyone else’s problem. Ive called hotlines and get robotic “that must be difficult for you” but while sympathy is nice, I need advice on how to better my life; if it’s even possible. I look in the mirror and all I see are flaws, messy hair, unshaven stubble, giant bags under my eyes. Im only 18 but I feel like an 80 year old trapped in a teenager’s body because im always feeling to crappy to be; for lack of a better word: “alive”. I have no life achievements to be proud of. I fail at everything I try to do, and I have no purpose. I was always an underachiever in school and that hasnt changed. In fact, I dont even go to school anymore. I decided to stay home for the semester because I found school too hard. Im weak, way too skinny (im 6 foot but weigh 145 pounds) awkwardly tall, and the ugliest person I’ve ever seen. I stupidly got involved with some bad people who scammed me for every penny I have and now I owe over 2000$ worth of money to various banks on no source of income. I broke my foot recently so I can’t get a job and the 2000$ is just accumulating interest. My life is fucked. Theres no other way to put it. Help me if you can... please"

2479,hospitalization,"I’m going off the deep end and thinking of suicide constantly. I’m thinking maybe I can check in myself in a hospital, I don’t trust anyone around me with my mental health and problems so its not possible to just talk it out with them or whatever some people might think. I’m in Québec, Canada so free healthcare and not so bad hospitals ( apparently). I can’t do it anymore and I know just one more little push and I’m gone. Is it wise for me to check in myself? Please I really need an answer please"
2480,Why is being alive so f**ing important?,"I am 40 years old. Passed 7-8 years I feel no need to live.  Have no will.  I am here because 1 my daughter.  To my friends.  Got lots.  Am a social person with or without drugs. More recently. 
Back to the question. This world is horrible.  We destroy each other. We destroy the planet.  It’s full of greed. It’s just unpleasant.  So why be here? The common answer I get is “you have a child”. - True that’s why I’m still here.  I have made sure she has a stable life with here mom.  Good memories of me. I have a great life insurance.  I am a good dad. Here moms new guy is a real great guy with good morals and ethics. 
And to be honest. Putting a child to this horrific world is probably the most egoistic thing I have ever done. 

So what the fuck am I doing here.  

Every night I daydream of different suicidal romantically dreams.   I probably know around 20 effective ways to end it.  I will choose the least messy. Or traumatic for my family and friends. 
When I have these daydream I find my self calm and smiling.  The only time I cry is when I in my head compose the farewell letters. It’s like leaving for a long vacation. That’s sad.  Otherwise the thought and feeling makes me calm and happy. 

I care a lot of my friends.  Put others first why can’t I just for once put myself first.  
Should I live a life I don’t want just for others?

I saw a doctor they put me on sick leave and wanted me to take some Prozac shit.  Well that fucking changes me.  Takes my libido.   No fucking well that’s the only really good feeling in life. 

So please again. Why should I stay here. I want to the doctor in hop fore therapy. They just want to make me a pleb no ups no downs and go forth and back to work till I die of old age miserable.   

I really see no fucking point. I am slowly getting rid of my stuff. Stopping subscriptions and don’t plan more than two months ahead. 

Appreciate real honest answers. Pros cons.  And please tell me if it’s legit to just fuck off. 

Love"

2482,I just want to let this emptiness consume me,"It’s almost like I want to do reckless things I know I’ll regret because at least I’ll feel alive. Literally a constant battle of telling myself to not make these bad decisions because they’ll hurt me more in the long run, versus telling myself to do it because at least I’ll escape this void I’m in 

Or maybe I’m just using this as an excuse to act out. I’m bored of life. I want so desperately to feel alive."
2483,"No Friends, Can't Find A Job, Feel Worthless","In December 2018, just after my 18th birthday my parents moved to a small(ish) town and I unfortunately had no choice but to move with them. I rarely speak to my friends now, lost my girlfriend have only had 1 job which I barely kept for even a month. 

I don't know how to make friends seeing as i'm out of school and the jobs I want to do are very rare to find out here and are generally filled by High Schoolers (Vehicle Mechanic, IT).  Looking at all the jobs opportunities that exist make me sad knowing that if I found a way to stay  in the city I could've made something out of myself."

2485,I just don’t know what to do,"I feel so alone, I don’t feel like I have anyone in my life to talk to. All my friends are so social and have romantic partners and whenever things starting going well for me they take a complete 180 and things end up terribly for me. I feel like I just sit in my room all day watching tv or playing video games. I thought going away for school would help me branch out but no matter how hard I tried there was always something that went wrong or I just lost interest..."

There are plenty of great reasons NOT to do the wife/kids thing but my god do I feel like an empty, shallow shell of a human being. I had no idea when I was younger that this was going to happen to me"
2489,No hope. No motivation to do anything. Overcoming this seems to be impossible.,"Waking up every morning with the overwhelming dread of facing another day is taking it’s toll, I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. Reoccurring suicidal thoughts are getting harder to deal with and I have no one to turn to, when does it end? How can it? I can barely go a few days without hearing from someone about how “sad” I look, I can’t hide it anymore, it’s taking over my whole personality and I don’t know how to stop it."

Even on our ""good days"", it still feels like I have to force myself to be happy. If I didn't date him, my life would have turned out completely different. I wouldn't have been manipulated out of going to university. I wouldn't be scared of going outside as I'm always indoors now because he needs me to be in call with him 24/7. I wouldn't have lost all my friends, since he made me think they were all bad and that he'd threaten to break up with me if I didn't leave them. I wish I wasn't so stupid back then. I wish I listened to everyone. I wish I trusted my gut about the red flags. I could have broken free from this garbage relationship long ago. But now it's too late. I don't have anyone. I'm emotionally broken and too weak (mentally) to do anything independently. I'm completely lost in life. I still live with my parents. They don't know what to do with me. I don't know what to do with myself either. I'm a waste of space. I don't know how life works. I don't know how to do anything. I just want to leave my relationship, but then I'll be all alone with nobody to talk to. I used to be a literal fucking ball of sunshine before I started dating him. I wish I didn't meet him. Fml."

How am I “smart” if I can barley write in coherent sentences, how am I “smart” when I can’t even remember things, how am I “smart” when my mind is so foggy and fucked up. I can barley even write this post. I feel like people only say this because it’s the only positive trait I have. I am not smart and even if I was I couldn’t care less. I just want to be happy."

Most of you may think I'm crazy or taking the p**s but honestly I feel stronger or worth more than just being capable of fighting my way through a crappy situation. 

We all have superpowers. 

- Overcoming a fear is a superpower.
- Facing your anxiety or depression is a superpower.
- Finding the strength to smile is a superpower.
- Going through s**t on your own is a superpower. 

I guess the right term I should use is empowering. But I just like this term better. :)"

2497,Finally understand my depressed boyfriend after I also became depressed,"I used to be very happy and not understand why my boyfriend couldn’t do things or dropped off the face of the earth sometimes. I love him to bits and I’ve always tried to be supportive and this strangely makes me love him a little more.  
I’ve fallen on hard times, it’s worse now than I could’ve ever imagined, and now I’m doing some of the things he does and it’s kind of like an ”ah-hah!” moment. I used to text him a lot and not get replies, now I’m matching the depressed silence because I don’t feel like I have anything interesting to say and I feel like nothing I say is worthwhile. Kind of sad, I know he probably likes hearing from me but I think I’m stupid and no one wants to hear from me. I need to keep telling myself that’s not actually the truth, but it really answers all the questions I used to have. I used to think he was ignoring me on purpose, or there was something I did. But no, texting is just hard when you don’t want to do anything.  
My boyfriend used to be desperate to be by himself and I didn’t understand why, today I just canceled everything I was supposed to do so I could turn off the lights and lay in my bed in silence for 4+ hours. I don’t even understand why, I just compulsively need to be alone and do nothing. 

Real big sad hours but at least I’m learning something from my big slump chump time."

2499,I have nowhere else to look and nothing else to do.,"I've been depressed for a few years now and I've tried so hard to be happy. I've had different meds, different doses, different doctors and it's all failed. I've had therapy, which now has come with added financial pressure as my docs, no matter how adamant I am, will not put me on the list for an NHS therapist. I tried going to societies at uni, I made no friends and felt more of a freak than I ever did. I tried dating apps for years now, feel lonelier and more of an unlovable inhuman fuck than I ever did. I can't bare to face my family with my problems anymore because I've failed to solve any of them, even after years of trying. I'm too ashamed to talk to my friends about anything. All I get is disappointment on a loop. Everyday that I'm still like this, makes the weight of it feel heavier and makes me feel that I'll never ever be happy. If you ask me to think of the future, I can't. I can't picture anything. I'm not living or dead. Happy or sad. I just can't picture a thing because I just don't know anymore. I don't know what to do or what will happen. All I know is my existence is fucking dog shit."
2500,Why do parents think that School can be fixed by just studying a bit more?,"Im in highschool junior year and my grades have dropped bad. I go to school everyday holding back tears because each time i go to chemistry or history or many of the other classes i have i leave the classroom remembering nothing and hating myself for it. When i get home my parents have emails. ""Your child seems to be struggling in school and would seem to do better if he took time to review more of the content we are working on."" I recently came out to my parents that im suicidal and depressed almost everyday of the week and we have a therapist lined up. But they continue to ask me if i just want to fail the classes. I tell them class goes by and I learn nothing no matter how hard i try and it seems like they havent listened. I've told them multiple times that I want to talk with the therapist because i simply cant find it in me to trust them but they continue to push. How do I explain to my parents that while I want to do well in school like the years before I just cant find the confidence or energy anymore to live through these next couple years in the first place?"
2501,Have you felt like this?,"I was lying on the bathroom floor sternly talking to my dog that she did something wrong.

2505,Its to hard today,I'm so tired of fighting. Fighting my brain and my feelings. Its not even worth it.
2506,Managed to push away negative thoughts,"I was having this really intensive thought meddled with fear and anguish of me dying (by that I mean doing the worst thing ever) in the following weeks, that I'd fall so deep that there would be no other solutions.

But then I had like this little voice of hope in me saying that this was all just bullshit, that it was just my mind tricking me, that is was not true and based on nothing. And a few seconds later, I was feeling better. I can't believe it was that easy. I was good for a few minutes then another negative thought went through my mind, and I casted it away like the first one.  


I don't know how, I just felt control over my mind for the first time in months. I still feel very empty inside, but now I feel like I can at least stop being negative about everything.

I hope for you all to reach this someday, it's a small step toward recovery.

Wish you all the best."
2507,Is life/the world really this shitty or am I missing something?,"Honestly, I feel like putting a gun in my mouth, aiming to the brain and pulling the trigger. That really describes how I feel, but unfortunately I can’t follow through with that plan because (1) I don’t have a gun and (2) I don’t want to end up like a fucking retard if I somehow manage to survive. If there were a sure fire way to go out and I was able to use it, I would totally do it. 

I just can’t stand my life anymore and there doesn’t seem to be a permanent fix to my problem. I feel like I’m a prisoner to my family’s expectations, working jobs I don’t like and doing things I don’t like. I’m not even sad; I still go about my life pretty normally; I eat, I sleep, I shower...I even go to the gym. But nothing really brings any lasting satisfaction. My family can’t understand that; they think I’m lazy or irresponsible.

Maybe my environment has something to do with it, but the only alternative would be going homeless, and that scares me. I sleep in a couch in my mom’s house; I can’t go to bed whenever I want because people are watching TV. I can’t afford to eat food I like when I like it. I’m slowly sinking into more debt while working a shitty sales job that pays minimum wage and forces me to prey on clueless prospects. I have less than 10 dollars in my bank account. 

I feel I’ve tried hard to make it work. I’ve tried hard in all the jobs I’ve had. It’s not like a feel like a victim. I just think society is mostly fucked up and some people, like me, just can’t put up with it long enough."
2508,Seeing a new therapist - what if I don’t know why I’m there?,"Short backstory: I’ve seen a therapist a few times in the last year or two but always felt like they wanted me to lead the conversation and talk about why I’m there... but what if I don’t know? I mean - I know I’m not myself, I know some days I feel really bad, but I can’t always pinpoint why or even exactly how I feel. I assume you get what you put into it with therapy but with my last person I just found myself saying like “yeah things seem better” because I didn’t know exactly what to say or talk about. I really just want  to scream “I AM NOT OKAY FIX ME” but that does not seem productive."
2509,I ruin everything,"I’m so tired of waking up everyday to realize I have shit to do. I’m tired of everything . I’m tired of socializing with people because I’m afraid they think I’m too boring or too depressed with my own problems. I’m failing school, my friend hates me, my best friends don’t even talk to me that often,I’m fucking done with life rn, idk what to do or where to start again, I can’t even breathe when I’m home because my family overwhelms me for no reason. I don’t want to be here, I don’t want to be anywhere right now. I just want to hide. Everything fucking hurts."

I can't leave my bed, so I'll just stay here. I can't bring myself to move or do anything. I'm just constantly crying for no reason
I wish everything around me would just stop happening for a while"

2513,Wanting to be left alone but also wanting to have someone there?,"It's something I'm really struggling to understand at the moment. When I'm with people - be it friends, at work, with family I just think about when I can get home because being around people makes me feel weird at the moment. But then when I am home and on my own I don't like that either as I don't particularly like my own company at the moment. What on earth do you do about that?"
2514,2 years inside,"I'm crying rn because I've been so depressed, that I didnt even realize that 2 years have gone by  and I have probably just stepped out if the house 20 times??!?

I wasted two years and omg... I don't know how to do anything or what to even do.

I don't have a job, I'm so afraid of going out and seeing the world even though it's what i dream of doing. 

I feel so... fucking beat down.

Two years of holding back. 

Two years of staying inside my house.

Two years I'll never be able to get back.

Please... help me.. I'm really losing hope here.

I'm so sad rn."
2515,I hate how I can’t fix my problems unless I die,I don’t want to wage slave anymore but I’m forced to do it because this world is based on slavery since I’m a slave to my bodily needs and society/the world. I hate doing many other things because they feel like fucking chores but I’m forced to do them and I just don’t see any way out besides death. Life must be fucking shit if you have to die just to fix your problems. Like holy fuck life feels like it was designed for retards by retards. There’s just no end to this stupid fucking ride and the worst thing is I never asked to be born. Goddamn this garbage will never end unless I die fuck it all.

2517,Feeling abandoned after a suicide attempt.,"Not entirely sure if this is the place to post this, but here we are. On the 23rd of November 2019, I attempted suicide via overdose on the rooftop of my apartment. Earlier that day my two roommates and I had a discussion to see how we were all feeling about the general tone of the apartment. In the month previous, I had finally run out of money and was unable to make rent. I had solved that problem by taking a job I hated and working the graveyard shift. For context, I had recently moved to that city and was unable to find employment at all. They're both full-time students at the local college, and both work an additional \~10 hours a week at internships, in one of their cases, his grandparents pay his rent and tuition. In this period of unemployment, I agreed to take on the majority of the housework, but as soon as I started working till 3:00 A.M. every day I became less and less reliable and willing to do my assigned duties. Our discussion about the tone of the apartment turned quickly into a ""One of us has to move out"" type discussion and they both agreed it should be me. I was given a month to find new housing. I discovered later that this was a decision they had agreed on previously, which shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did because I had woken up to them talking unkindly about me on a couple of occasions. As it stands, I got low and didn't see an out so I waited till they left for something, went to the rooftop of my apartment, and over the course of an hour downed an entire bottle of high strength Tylenol and 3 beers. A fair few folks called and texted me attempted to locate me, and I am happy they did, but I didn't respond. I called the suicide hotline after I took the pills so I could hear a friendly voice before passing out. I woke up later in the ambulance and spent 3 days in the ICU. I texted folks to let them know I'm ok a few days later. Everyone was glad I was alright, but after that, absolutely no one has attempted contact with me. Am I justified in feeling abandoned and that it might not have had that much impact if I hadn't wound up in that ambulance? Thanks for reading."
2518,i’m so empty,i’m just so numb and i don’t know anymore i don’t understand i don’t even know how to express it properly but i just wish i could dissolve
2519,"My Girlfriend broke up with me, the worst part, i understand why.","I am my ex girlfriend now have been in a relationship for 3 years, now. we had been talking less lately, me being in Germany and she being in India. i work two jobs and i am trying my level best to make ends meet and clear off my student debt. 
Well, long story short, Today in the morning we texted and it was the general sarcastic, passive aggressive take on every thing we spoke and suddenly she said that she didn't love me anymore.  She said she would hurt me being in this relationship because she would not be able to give her 100 percent and couldn't believe in the concept of love anymore.  She also said she was thinking of discussing this with me and tried finding faults in me for the past month or so, but she couldn't find any reason for breaking up. Today she thought it was better to tell me the truth that was bothering her for so long.
She was my first love, we graduated college together and had all our firsts.  My brain understands what's happened but the person inside me refuses to believe. I am extremely depressed and all of the sad songs i used to hear make way more sense to me now. 
I don't want to fuck up my career too... but i think if i keep being this depressed i definately would. 
Can somebody help.  
Opinions on how i can overcome... similar experiences maybe.?😶

I really loved her. and i can't breathe when i think of our times together. 
i feel someone's sitting on my chest. I can't eat. I am 25 and she's 24."
2520,"I hate my friends for being annoying, probably because I’m annoying too","they are my friends because they are the best I could do. I’m not going to go into too much detail how my friends are annoying but they definitely are. It’s getting to the point where I can’t talk to either of them without arguing. One does things like corrects my pronunciation and then a few minutes later corrects my saying the same word back to the way I originally said it and the other drinks constantly, does nothing for himself and won’t shut the fuck up about how shallow women(I’m a woman) are and how Muslims are destroying the world (i am acquaintances with some very nice Muslims and even if I wasn’t fuck right off with that). It’s getting to the point where after years of being friends out of desperation and loneliness I am, during a bout of incredible loneliness, just fed up with both of them. My partner, who lives far away and I rarely see, is getting fed up with me and I can tell because all I ever talk about anymore is how miserable I am. I very much don’t like people, I don’t have many interests that I know how to find people to share them with and I am bitter and judgmental. I try my hardest to be kind and likable but at the end of the day I feel I’m not meant to be around others"
2522,This is the first birthday where I didn't think about killing myself since I can remember.,"And only now I realize how _this_ should be normal. Therapy has worked. I got better.

Stay strong guys."
2523,Today was a good day,"I was up late last night, working on my writing projects. I slept from 4 am to 12 pm. As soon as I got up, I made myself some coffee and had a smoke. Then I started cleaning and I didn't stop for about 3 hours. I cleaned my kitchen and loaded my dishwasher. I started a load of clothes which is now dried, save for my jeans. I swept and mopped my kitchen floor, organized my games, wiped off and dusted my game stand and my computer table. I cleaned out my sink and wiped down my counters. I threw away a bunch of trash and walked the bags out to the dumpster. I also vacuumed my carpet and used my vacuum brush on the back of my PC, and the vents on my TV. I lit some incense and just relaxed until my son's mom dropped him off.

We spent some time together already. We played a little Final Fantasy 7, which we just started a game on together. For the gamer nerds out there, we are getting ready to blow up the 2nd reactor.

The last major thing I need to do is go and get some groceries. I tried using the walmart grocery app, but they don't have pickup on Sundays. I am really nervous about going. I have a debilitating fear of crowds. If I know I have to get groceries, I get knots in my stomach. I don't mean to sound cliche, but I hate people as a society for a number of reasons:

* Loud, disruptive children.
* Children who are buckets of disease. I have seen 5 year old boys with one hand in their pants, and the other in their nose. 
* Adults who are somehow completely oblivious to the fact that there are other people shopping with them. Get the fuck out of the way. Do not block off an aisle with your cart and your fat ass while you try to decide between two different types of baked beans.
* Karens who reunite with other Karens and make the very spot they stand, their new date spot. 
* Germ ridden cart handles.
* 3 wheels work on the cart, one of them is on vacation. 
* Waiting in line because 88 year old Matilda wants to complain about one of her items being supposedly 30 cents off.

Suffice it to say, I hate crowds, and I hate grocery shopping. However, once I get and get what I need and bring it back home, it will be like a load off my shoulders.

Tonight after my kiddo goes to bed, three of my work buddies and myself are going to bring down some behemoths on Dauntless. 

I'm just appreciating the fact that I had a good day. I don't want to let that feeling go."
2524,IM SO STUPID AND DUMB AND USELESS I REALLY TRY BUT MY BEST ISNT EVEN ENOUGH WTF DO I DO I FEEL LIKE IM LOSING MY MIND,Just felt like i needed to get that of my mind UwU. Sad? No wtf do you mean im fucking ”happy” ahah ;))))
2525,I can't take care of my dog anymore,"Hi everyone, this is my first post. I just need advice, but prepare for an extremely long post... also excuse grammar/spelling errors I'm really emotional and just have to get this out there


Im 19, i got my dog when i was 12. I actually think im in a better place then I've ever been as far as my mental health goes, but i just don't think i can take care of my baby anymore. When i got him i was a child, i didnt understand the responsibilities that come with a dog, the care they require, any of that. I feel like i didnt sign up for this responsibilty and now i hate myself for it because it is now ME who is neglecting him then ME who will abandon him. My parents had a dog prior to this that I loved who passed away before i got my current dog. I guess he was my brothers but growing up i remember just seeing him chained up all the time cause he constantly ran away and no one walking him, i remember trying to ""set him free""as a child.. yes I now know how horrible his treatmant was but i was a kid i didnt know. I also have compassion for my parents as they had a rough impoverished upbringing in Mexico where having a dog basically meant just feeding it and keeping it in a yard, they werent allowed to let them go inside, thats how they grew up so i dont want them to sound like horrible people, they genuinley think my current dog is well taken care of. But he's not, and i hate myself for it because hes 8 years old and my everything. I picked him out as a puppy when i was 12 a lab/border collie mix SUPER HIGH ENERGY. He was only aloud to stay outside and my dad actually fenced the yard so it provided large space for him and no chain. His lil doghouse outside i managed to get blankets, i would save money i would ask my mom to buy a snack at school lunch to get blankets/fabric at the thrift store to make his living space comfortable, i would keep his outside area clean by often picking up trash, his poop. I started brushing him everyday, bathing him once a month. Fed him and gave him water everyday, i would walk him to the park to get his vaccines(by the afforable leaque that comes yearly), id get him when he managed to get out and landed in the shelter. I love this dog, i thought i was doing great. Once he was fully grown my parents didnt let me walk him saying i couldnt control him. I was 13 and he was around 90 pounds. So he never got properly leash trained. Hes outside by himself most of the time. I said fuck that and walked anyways.. he did drag me a couple times at first but i did it anywayz. At one point i managed to walk him 2 hours everyday. Then at 16 i got a full time job and highschool, depression was it its most severe, i developed substance abuse problems, i wasnt even taking care of myself. And my poor dog just stayed out there by himself most of the time, he was fed, had a shelter, but my god that is so fucked. My parents saw nothing wrong w it. I live in a trailer in the shittier side of town and i never see anyone walk there dogs, theyre all chained w barely any space to walk, theyre not groomed, it fucks with my head that im so disgusted in myself for this but if i gave him to anyone else i doubt he would be better off and that scares the shit out of me. It was hard to find time to walk him so i did it at night. After the second time some strange man started screaming at me i was too scared to do that again. So lonely he was again. I love this dog i really do. But i cant take care of him. Its taken so much hard work to get to a point that i consistently shower, feed myself, get proper sleep that i cant handle the responsibilty of this dog and he deserves better. I still live with my parents as im not financially stable as a full time college student, with a job to live on my own. So my dog is outside 24/7, im not home most of the time, and when i am im tired, dont wanna go outside, dont want people looking at me, i dont feel like walking him and hate myself for that. This dog loves me, ive made an effort to walk him at least once a week for an hour but im starting to resent it. I dont even have the outgoing personality to walk him. I hate people that come up to talk to me constantly it gives me so much anxiety, the fucking random people that yell ""wow big dog!"" ""Is he walking you or you walking him"" i hate it so much, i hate all of it. this neighborhood is kinda shitty so MULTIPLE times walking him some dog tries to attack us cause nobody even tries to take care of there dogs here and i dont want to be like them. My dogs gotten checkups before and hes healthy, hes beautiful and extremely sweet. Hes microchipped  and up to date with his rabies shots. But ive grown up with him for these past years genuinley trying my hardest. I remember i had a similar mental breakdown last yr about this to my ex boyfriend and he said i was overreacting and hes fine? But am i? Cause reading through info online, through the doc care subreddits, im seriously neglecting him arent I? I didnt even learn that dogs were supposed to he walked everyday till last year and my parents laughed about it thinking i was being overdramaric WTF. I think my dog deserves to live out the rest of his years with someone who can keep him inside so he doesnt have to face extreme temperstures and can socialize more, he deserves to be walked everyday, he deserves someone that has more free time to spend with him, he deserves someone without depression that struggles to even take care of themself. I walked him today and it was such a struggle i dreaded going outside before i did it for hours, felt so much anxiety while i did it, and i just cant handle this for this period of my life. I really wish shelters would give a clear explanation of what the dog requires for their health before just giving them away like that. But, how fucked up and cruel is it to just give him away no? I remember one time at my exes house i brought him so he could play in his huge yard. I went back inside for an hour and i have no idea how he managed to get out of the tall wooden fence but he did, and he didnt run around the neighborhood, he just sat outside the door to my surprise seeing he was waiting there the whole time for me. He loves me how could i do this to him, but clearly im not suited for this, i wish i wouldve known sooner, hes still very energetic, he doesnt get along with dogs too well but he does with people. There's NO way i could take him to a shelter, im scared if i give him to someone else hes gonna be worst off cause people here dont take good care of there dogs at all, as in they tie them to a chain and never let them out. Ive taken him to parks, the lake, taught him some demands, ive really tried my hardest i just wish this wasnt something decided for me, but of course im still accountable for all this. Just thinking about giving him up makes me cry. And now im just a piece of shit for thinking of that but man what is the alternative? People often suggest pets to help with depression, and as an adult knowing what I know about dogs i definitley know i couldnt handle that and will not get one again tell im ready, if ever again, ive 100% learned my lesson. Im thinking a snake is more my style... But seriously i feel like im having a mental breakdown. This has happened before but i swear nobody around me cares or takes this issue seriously so i dont know what to do. I just need some input, i will value this since you guys dont know me, wont sugar coat shit, and can relate to the absolute difficulty it is to do anything with depression and why this is so hard for me. Thank you"
2526,25 y/o college failure,"Next Saturday, when I see for myself that I failed this semester in classes, which will then take away my financial aid next semester, I’ve decided I’ll kill myself. I’m 25, have never amounted to anything really, you know, basic sad sack being a parasite to those well meaning fools around me. I live with my parents; they have a 9 mm which should make it quick at least. I’ve thought of this for years and years in the making... I don’t have access to pills that would do the job, and after my last few attempts with it, I know it wouldn’t work by itself. It won’t be a pretty show, but it’s be cheaper then them trying to pump my stomach. Hanging/suffocation takes too long. It’s sounds so stupid to say, but I’m afraid of heights, so jumping is out 
I’d rather ruin the next month for my family and bf then ruin the rest of their lives.

I’ve been depressed since I was 15, and suicidal by the time I was 18. I keep fucking up, mistake after mistake, excuse after excuse. I’ve been in situations like this with financial aid before, and this is a third strike situation. I’ve just lost hope"
2527,View of depressive disorders and symptoms from someone in the mental health field.,"Hey all,

I just wanted to say I'm glad you're here, glad you're reading this, and I hope you keep or seek treatment for depression until you find a combination that helps the most.

I'm an MSW student, also an addiction counselor, and I'm finishing my degree later this year. We have to intern 20 hours a week for the duration of the full time 2 year program, and a lot of us like me also work in related fields, in my case chemical dependency. I also have an undergraduate degree in psychology.

I'm NOT posting this as an expert or as advice, but rather as an invitation to see depression from my view as someone who is providing therapy for people who suffer from it in its various forms of all ages. 

My heart really goes out for my clients who have depression. Therapists often talk about being able to feel it in the air with our clients, and I can relate to that. The energy levels change completely during a session with someone suffering from depression, and a lot of times you end feeling tired, why that is I don't know. Just makes me feel all the more empathetic and want to help.

Depression seems like a condition that warps perceptions that are neutral into very negative ones all while sapping energy levels and a capacity for motivation and pleasure. Many of the clients I've met go through periods where they can't get out of bed, can't work, can't manage their daily routines and needs. As a therapist I worry about this and want to help the client to get back on their feet as much as can be done, at a safe pace, so that they don't suffer so long but also because often this can lead to awful consequences. People blame themselves for their exhaustion, and I don't think they should, I wish they would stop listening to the voice inside that calls them lazy, it's not laziness, it's depression.

It seems that while a growing number of people are understanding depression and mental health today, still many have convictions about it which are superstitious, based on their conception of religious teachings, some don't believe in mental health at all, and many are simply are uninformed, and this includes people suffering from depression as well as their family members.

It seems like it's the perfect storm because so often this compounds the negative self beliefs or just negative beliefs about the world that are symptoms of depression. I mean in our diagnostic books and literature and in research, it's very clear about common negative beliefs like feeling as though you're a burden, believing you are lazy, believing you are worthless, feelings of guilt that aren't fair, taking responsibility for things that aren't truly appropriate to take responsibility for, and having very unfair self expectations, among others. I hate hearing when a client who already has these thoughts in their head due to the condition they did not choose to have then hears a family member or important person say some highly misinformed or stigmatic thing about them or about depression or mental health. That's fuel for the fire.

These thoughts are intrusive, they aren't a choice as far as I can tell, just like having depression is NOT a choice, it's not because you did something wrong. This is something I hear a lot too, people take ownership for having depression and feel they earned it somehow. When I hear this, I know it is the depression telling them this, twisting perception, taking advantage of a weakness that can be exploited to make the depression worse. Everything I have read, everything I have seen, everything I've been taught does not support the notion that it's a choice or a consequence, though some things can make it worse, like alcohol use and drugs.

I also don't blame people for turning to alcohol and drugs, it gives a sense of control over the emotions and state of mind, and maybe some brief relief, but of course there is a big price to pay. When clients with depression do use substances often they end up having much more severe depressive symptoms for some time afterward, and no I don't mean like a hangover.

I'm personally in recovery from addiction myself and one thing about that reminds me of depression. I always felt like I had a little voice in my head that encouraged or demanded me to keep drinking, that rationalized, and that really set me up way ahead of time for relapse, like it was working behind the scenes. I eventually gave it a name and that helped me differentiate that voice, or more specifically those thoughts from my own, but it took time. 

I think with people who have depression there is a similar voice in there that is working behind the scenes, and I believe identifying it and segregating it might be helpful for clients in treatment. It's one thing I encourage my clients to try to do, to recognize that the core person who is you within is not the depression, that the depression is a hitch hiker along for the ride, it's not you at least that's what I believe.

Beyond the negative thoughts and exhaustion are suicidal thoughts and plans and attempts and completion. I have had to do quite a  large number of suicide assessments and safety plans with clients, many who were teens but adults as well. When I'm doing this process of asking the questions, I so want that person to feel that I feel for them and that I'm there with them in the moment. It seems like many times though they are so sapped by the depression they can't even feel it, but maybe I'm wrong. Doing those assessments often leaves me wishing I could provide more. 

We really do try to avoid any involuntary hospitalization, at least I do and everyone I've worked with, we always would prefer voluntary hospitalization and treatment so that the person can get through the low point safe. We know that many people do eventually get their treatment working right for them and they are glad they survived, that they did not die, and they end up living very wonderful lives largely free of the symptoms which once crippled them. That's not a fairy tale, that's real, and I wish so badly that my clients could believe it.... so badly :( I never believed I could live sober and be happy for what that's worth but here I am :) we can change and there is help.

Just want to know if you are reading this that as mental health ""professionals"" we have to hold back on some things we want to say that you might want to hear, some of us say anyways in our own ways, some prefer to be more clinical. So I'll tell you that we love you, we care about you, we want you to feel better so bad, we want to help you get out of this shit, but we need your help to do it, so please ask for help... and don't give up."
2528,It’s getting harder to explain how I feel to others,Everything just seems so foggy and confusing. It’s getting harder to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way. Sometimes I honestly just don’t know what to say.
2529,Time wasted,"All this time I could have been doing something, literally anything besides sleeping for 3/4ths or the day. It’s odd but I don’t even acknowledge my physical body anymore, I just feel like a dead soul forced to wait until the other physical parts of me die.

At this point it kind of feels like even if I was somehow cured of depression, I would spend all my time wishing I had all of this time back."
2530,I don't know what to do,"I feel disconnected from most things around me. It's like I'm invisible, but I have all of these emotions. I think instead of being sad in the midst of my loneliness and depression, I've grown comfortable with it. So comfortable I don't want to leave, my sadness manifests in anger now, but not towards any one person just towards life. I wish I could be normal. I wish I didn't get caught up in my thoughts all the time."
2531,Anyone else just assumed they were going to die as a kid?,"For as long as I can remember, I assumed I was going to die, that I wouldn’t live past my 20’s. It wasn’t a suicidal thing until I got older though"
2532,"Can't escape rural life. I'm at peace with killing myself, but don't want to be. Is there anything I can do?","Hi guys

There are no mental health services near me. 

I really hate it here. I hate the community in particular

I do not like being outside in public around here, or walking in nature around here anymore. 

I do not have the money to move. I do not have the qualifications to apply for a job elsewhere. 

I do not drive and cannot afford lessons. 

I see my family maybe two days a week for a couple hours. They are supportive but you cannot live off a couple hours a week worth of contact with people you care about. 

I feel like I might kill myself soon, I'm at peace with it and it seems like an inevitability that is getting closer and closer. 

Is there anything at all you guys can think of for me to do about it that isn't just ""Change your perspective?"""
2533,How does anyone actually want to be alive?,I have come to realize only selfish ambitions for recognition have been my main motivator. With aging being treated like a crime and being 27 with what finally seems like some clarity as to the actual content of my character. (And no intentions to have children) what could I possibly have to stick around for? Feeling like a totalled car mentally that isn't worth the trouble of restoring. My programs are all wrong. Jesus help me and all of the other narcissists too
2534,I'm scared I'm going to kill myself,It's all I think of and it really scares me. All I feel is anger and sadness but no one seems to care or see it because of a fake mask I put on. I feel ashame of myself for these thoughts but it's all I think of now.
2535,Crying isn’t helping me feel any better,"I haven’t felt this depressed in quite awhile, but my grandpa was just hospitalized last night and my family isn’t sure how much longer he has. I feel like my whole world is crumbling around me because I love my grandpa so much and he’s the only person in my entire life who has ever shown me unconditional love before. All I’ve done today is lay in bed and cry because I feel so helpless since I live several hours away from him and can’t go see him. Normally when I cry I feel better afterwards but it seems no matter how much I cry I don’t feel any better. I’m stuck between either feeling numb or bawling my eyes out because I just want the pain to stop. I don’t want to kill myself, I just want to stop feeling like my world is collapsing in on me."
2536,Meds Not Working During Menstruation,"So over the past four months I’ve noticed a pattern, as mentioned in the title. Is this an issue for any other women? I’m on 150 Venlafaxine, 20 Wellbutrin, and .75 Levothyroxine. I’ve never had such intense sadness or anger in previous cycle days until I started the Ven/Well combo. I’m pretty much constantly one step behind either bursting into tears or getting red with anger during my cycle days. Very roller coaster, up and down. Is this just a varying symptom of said cycle? Otherwise I’ve been doing really well up until the week before the first cycle day. It’s hard to know what feelings are real and what aren’t."
2537,I can’t contact my therapist and I’m feeling depressed.,"I’m also in the middle of a breakdown and considering self harming for the first time in my life. 16/F somebody please help me, or kill me."
2538,Reasons to live,I honestly don’t think I have any motivation to live. My adolescence has been good and rough. My dad beat my ass sometimes and we didn’t always have money. But my brother and my mom were always nice and I had stuff to do  and ppl to hang out with in high school. But after I graduated my life got worse and it’s been a grind. I worked numerous part time jobs and hustled  my way through two years of community college and transferred to a good school and got a half scholarship. I still have to work a lot and idk I start seeing the negative things in life. I started noticing that almost all my friends are just superficial assholes. My parents split up and we still all live in the same house so there’s yelling everyday I spend most days by myself the whole day barely talking to anybody. I mean yeah I’ve improved aspects of my life but I don’t know what I want to do or if I even want to continue living tbh. Those years broke me and I few months ago I hit my breaking point. I was in the middle of a shift and went to lunch and all the lack of i life I’ve had hit me I just went to the bathroom and cried.I don’t like what I do or where I’m going to go. My mom knows I get down sometimes but she just doesn’t know it all of it I genuinely think about killing myself a few times a week but I can’t do to the fact of all my mom did for me I can’t pay her back by ending it. Idk I’m just scared tbh I spew false positivity I don’t have to others and perfected a fake smile. I don’t know i just don’t think any of this was or is going to be worth it. I isolated myself from my “friends” and I made a good friend on here but I can’t unload all my problems on someone else. I just don’t want to graduate get a 9-5 job and get old and die and not be happy again cuz I’d rather just be die now to end the suffering
2539,Sigh,"My girlfriend makes me so mad. Everything I do or say is always wrong. We fight so fucking much. I don’t know if I want to go on like this, it makes me crazy."
2540,Normally numb,"Normally I feel numb all the time as I suffer from chronic depression despite being on antidepressants. Sometimes, I get waves of the overwhelming urge to cry and cannot stop and it goes on for days. It usually feels like I'm grieving but no one died on top of feeling ill (body aches, headaches, GI problems). Does anyone else get this too or am I just weird?"
2541,I just... I don't know!,"I feel lost, I don't know what is happening to me. I'm ok, then I'm NOT ok, then I'm trying to be ok, then I don't know if I'm ok. I'm not even sure if it's depression, anxiety or whatever?! I'm still full of hope and I really do believe in life but there's a disgusting duality in me, I don't know if it's alright to like the things that I'm passionate about and it sounds stupid. It's like having a sense of guilt right when you enjoy an activity, feeling not belonging and not deserving.

It leaves me with hours of zoning out and wasting time. That's it, just wanted to write something somewhere... might delete later."
2542,Everything I touch dies,"I loved someone once. I truly loved him. I never felt with any person the way I did with him, not before or since. Felt it in my soul, a peace that I can't find with anyone else or on my own. We walked away from one another because of what I will call a family feud. His family was toxic. I later realized that mine was too. The only way for us to be together would have been to leave them behind and we were both to f*cking responsible to do that. Our families needed us, in reality we were both crutches for them, but I digress...The worst part about this is that my main reason for leaving was because my sister was struggling because his brother was basically stalking her and they had some weird secret possibly abusive relationship. I don't really know exactly, just that she was falling apart and I chose to preserve her over my own happiness. In my mind I wouldn't have been able to be happy knowing she was miserable or even that my s.o.'s psycho brother could have done something to her. I lost 3 people who were close to me to domestic violence at a very young age, violent murders and it haunts me still. I wasn't willing to go through that with my own sister. 

In the spirit of f*cking me over, life deals me this ironic twist about a year later: my sister suffers a seizure which caused her to be in a coma for 2 days and cost her to lose about a decade worth of memories. She didn't remember any of us, not my mom, not even her own name.

So even though all this happened a little over 10 years ago I think about it from time to time and I'm awe struck at the irony of the situation. She was the only person who knew how much I suffered for him. She and I were so close that I was willing to give him up for her and NONE OF IT MATTERS!!! she doesn't even remeber that we were ever friends. I just entered my thirties and she has the mind of a 14 year old. I lost her after all I did to try and keep her, keep us together. I lost her anyway.

It's like I can't hold on to anything. Even when I tried to pour myself into my work, I ended up losing it because I started having these crazy panic attacks and I hurt my spine...just a bunch of medical problems... Ended up homeless for a spell, after finally having a nice apartment in a nice neighborhood, dating again, and feeling like things were turning around for me. Poof. Then 2 years ago I had to give up the last thing I loved, my cat of 7 years. My last happiness. I couldnt take care of him anymore with my ailments and depression so I surrendered him to the nicest shelter I could find. 

I feel hopeless. I feel every failure weighing down on me, crushing me, crushing my will to go on. And the thought of my absent love burns so deeply and painfully. The loss of my sister too. She's not dead but she isnt ""here"" anymore. She's like a ghost. I see her, I interact with her, but the sister I knew is gone.

Perhaps I am trying to have something I wasn't meant to. I've always been a lonely person but 10 years in and I can't shake the feeling that I was simply meant to be alone."
2543,Struggle,I've  been struggling for year. Recently my weight has really gotten bad after falling into a bad depression and eating my feelings. I need help. Does anyone have any tips in losing weight? Motivation?
2544,Hey all,Im losing my mind! Holy fuck how it get so dark
2545,Should I tell my teachers how I actually feel?,"Everyday im in my teachers lesson she aways asks how im feeling. If my days been shit or has just been average. She knows about my absolute shite mental health, infact less than a year ago i had what felt mental breakdown and was at the lowest ive ever felt during her lesson and she was really supportive and understanding. 

At the start if the year my depression wasnt as severe as it was before the summer holidays but she would still ask me how i was feeling. But lately i feel like everythings going bad again. My mood is horrible my anxiety is through the roof and i havent bee able to sleep well for the past month. Ti the point where i am sleeping in lessons, not just because im exhausted but also cause the only time the depression and anxiety and the world goes away is when im asleep. But whenever anyone asks i just say i didnt sleep well and dont mention my rapidly increasing depresssion

I have a lesson with this teacher tomorrow and she will ask me how im feeling and part of me whats to tell her the truth. That am feeling absoutely awful. But its like im go on autopilot when people ask me anything and a say that im fine before ive even registered how i am actually feeling. But also i just feel like im a burden on everybody.

Also how do i explain to someone that im not suicidal and im not gonna kill myself, but i feel absolutely hopeless about life. That i hate myself so much it hurts. That i know i would be better off not alive and i wish i wasnt alive. That its my head thats fucked and nothing is ever gone fix that. 

And whenever i do say anything to a teacher they email my mum. Which i totally understand that they have to do. But i just wish they didnt. Its not that i want to hide it from my mum, shes brilliant and tends to know if something is up even before i realise it myself. I dont know really i just wish they wouldnt tell her about this. Probably because if i tell she will ask me how she can help but in reality no one can help cause my brains so fucked it cabt be fixed. And then i feel guilty when i tell her she cant help cause i know she feels like im angry at her when im not

Ughhh i hate my mind so much"
2546,Maybe there's a version of me in a different dimension living my wildest dreams,"Maybe there's a version of me who had a great childhood, great father, nice family, in a relationship with his first love, brain pumping with serotonin and has a lot to lose and has so many reasons to keep going. No loneliness, no broken heart, no shitty mental health. It's a nice thought."
2547,Suicidal for the first time in quite a while,I can't pin down why at all but it's really tearing me apart and I'm not sure what to do.
2548,I did something today!,"I did some schoolwork today! Almost half an hour of learning continuously. It feels like a big accomplishment because today was a bad day, while yesterday was a good day. I did a lot of work yesterday but I am more proud of doing the tiniest bit of work today, because I usually dont even have the motivation to get out of bed to go sit at my desk most days, except for days like yesterday. And I did it. I got up and sat there and did some summarizing. I wanted to share this with you because I don't feel like anyone in my life would understand why I am proud. Still a bad day. But a little bit better. 😊"
2549,I'm shit,"She couldn’t wait to get the fuck out of the voice chat and talk to her friend or whatever. She didn’t have interest in me at all. All she wanted was attention. From anyone, anyone on this fucking Earth. She doesn’t even give a shit about me. If someone else is giving her attention, she would prefer that person over me. If she was slightly more attractive she wouldn’t even talk to me, and that’s because she would already have a boyfriend. Why the fuck would she want to talk to me? I’m literally a piece of shit that no one fucking likes. Fucking ugly with a shitty personality. She just wanted my attention and company when she’s bored, and no one else is giving her attention. I’m hate her so fucking much, and I wish I never met her."
2551,Anyone experienced dream happiness?,"Hi all,

I’m sure I’m not alone in the lack of happiness. I can’t remember the last time I felt happiness. Like pure, I can’t help but smile happiness. 

The other night I had a dream where I was happy. I just felt... great. Then I woke up and soaked it in for about a minute before it left and have wanted it back ever since. 

Anyone else get experiences like this?"
2552,Please get help don’t end up like me.,Long story short I won’t be here soon but before I go I wanted to tell you guys and girls to get help before it’s to late and you guys do something crazy like me. Remember you have family and friends who love you have a great day goodbye everyone
2553,I have a question..,"A few weeks ago, my dog died. I had been with her for 8 years and she just died overnight while on the vet because her kidneys stopped working. Obviously, I broke down into tears when I got the news. 
I cried because I lost my dog, but I didn't feel anything. I cried and knew I was meant to be sad, but I didnt feel sad. I felt nothing, and I just realized that every day I feel the same as I felt that day. Nothing.

Am I depressed? I'm relatively young (14-15), so I dont really know."
2554,Saturday was my 30th and only two people said happy birthday.,My mum and my husband. Thats it.
2556,Life is simply ridiculous,"It’s so funny how people think it’s acceptable that everybody has to spend 99% of their times bored and miserable, working just to be able to afford the luxuries that they should be taking for granted. Housing, electricity, water, food and most importantly whatever entertains them. It’s utterly ridiculous how doing what you like for 1% of your time requires you to do what you do NOT want for the remaining 99%. Even their dream job isn’t gonna cut it for most people as turning a hobby into a responsibility ruins it for you and even a dream job is quickly going to become a burden as it’s turned into something you have to do. Social life is also so terribly underwhelming. People never notice anything about you, they rarely say what you wanna hear. They are so quick to judge and betray. I’ve barely seen the word “society” ever get used in a positive context and I think there is good reason to that. People are just so mean, selfish and stupid. It’s so terrifying how wanting a significant other who’s actually supportive, loyal and compassionate is considered high standards. The absolute state of the human mind also doesn’t help in the slightest. Most of us are biased towards negativity. Here’s what I mean: sadness, hate and emberassment are all felt much more strongly and for longer than their positive counterparts which are happines, love and pride. It’s like positive emotions are like an orgasm, lasting for mere seconds, while negative emotions are like an ache, lasting for hours or perhaps even days. It’s outrageous how wanting a fun life of doing what you wanna do and being happy for the most of the time while being surrounded by great friends and a significant other who genuinely loves you, is considered unrealistic. It’s unbelievable how living a boring life as a workaholic who has an underwhelming  social life and feels negative emotions for the most of the time, is considered normal. How can one simply say suicide is not the way when life is like this. Life is not about what we want to do, it’s about what we have to do. Isn’t it irrational to even want to live? Doesn’t that literally make us the prisoners of our survival instinct? I don’t know about you people but I find it very calming, relieving and soothing that all I have to do to alt F4 out of this mess is to simply jump out of a window."
2557,Shit plans and New year's eve,"I asked my friends what we will be doing for new years eve for quite a while, but everyone said we still have time to plan. We are a group of max 8 people. I said I'll be down for whatever as long as I'm not left alone. They know I'll have to spend it with my mom and my alcoholic father, because I have no other options.

Two weeks ago when I insisted we just choose something, one said they'll be out of town, other two that they want to spend it as a couple and so on. So, it's another year with my family.

Instead of studying for my exam I remembered this, that my friends, knowing of my home situation, never ask me how I feel and it spiralled into me still crying after 2 hours and thinking of every reason why life is shit. Can't wait to barely be able to wake up with hurting puffy eyes and running for the bus so I won't miss my exam."
2558,It's so hard to keep going,Every time I try to improve my life it just ends up blowing up in my face one way is too much one way is not enough and the middle ground doesn't work either with EVERYTHING! It is becoming too hard for me to want to keep trying anymore. It doesn't seem worth it since every time  I try it ends up worse than before. I was on a few month stretch without depression or anxiety and now my depression is at an all time high. I have been getting worried. I have had multiple days where the depression leaves me with so much physical pain and obviously mental pain to even leave my bed or bedroom. I really don't know how to fix any part of it. Thanks for letting me vent reddit. Too bad it won't do anything for me.
2559,Worst BIRTHDAY EVER,I’ve been lying in bed all day crying. I’m so broke I can’t even get myself a decent meal or feel like today even matters.
2560,Depressed because I am worried I committed academic misconduct.,I paraphrased a quote and cited it but one of the words was not changed. All of the others were and the word was used in a different structure. It is not something Turnitin would flag but I can’t change it now and I feel sick and ultra depressed about it.
2561,"Have you ever thought you were doing better, but then taken a step back and realized you were doing far, far worse?","After barely surviving a suicide attempt earlier this year, I was trying really hard to get my mental health under control.  And I thought I was doing a good job!  I was going to class way more often than I had in the past.  I got up, ate, and showered every day.  I made an effort to try and open up to a few people, and even though that usually didn't go well, at least I tried.  I've been trying really hard to meet a therapist or psychiatrist, but all the offices I've contacted are full, or haven't responded to my requests.  

But because I was trying, I thought I must have been improving.  I can see now I was lying to myself.

Despite trying harder than I ever have in my life in succeeding in school, I'm failing at least one of my classes.  Maybe two.  I could flunk out of my major, and then I really don't know what I'd do with my life.  Not that I know what I'm doing now.

I'm supposed to submit a final exam online by midnight tonight, but I just can't make my brain work.  I stare at the pages, I try to learn... and nothing happens.  I'm not used to this.  I used to be smart and absorb information, and now it's like my brain is permanently in low-power mode, performing the barest of functions needed to survive.

Yesterday, for the first time in my life at 20, I cut myself.  I should have realized then something was seriously wrong, but as odd as it sounds, it didn't really concern me.  I cut myself again today too.  And the most twisted thing is, I like it.  Ever since my failed suicide attempt, I realize people will be really upset if I die (even if they don't give enough a shit about me to check in when I'm alive apparently), but cutting has given me that aspect of control back over my life.

So yea, I could really use someone to snap me the fuck out of whatever is happening.  None of my friends will do it.  Apparently I'm not high enough of a priority for a licensed professional to meet with me and do it.  So now I'm hoping some stranger on the internet will give me advice?  Fuck.  I don't know how I got here, but I wish I was somewhere else."
2562,About your face,Guys and girls check mewing on youtube thanks me later
2563,Comitting suicide isn't for cowards,"I cant find happiness in anything and recently i broke up with my girlfriend too . All the things that maybe i once was able to enjoy are now replaced by constant depression and fear of boringness. I go to bed , try to watch something and then i start crying of fear that i wont enjoy anything . I dont care at all about school anymore and my ex doesnt even want to keep me as a friend and see each other from time to time in school . I live in fear of waking up the next day and do not know who i could possibly tell so i lighten up my burden.  Going to school is scary as well . Being focused is a very big problem and teachers stressing me with grades does not help. Thinking of dying isnt uncommon in this situation  , thus , if you are positive that you wont be able to be happy again and decide on taking your life...  youre just smart by not hurting yourself more ."
2565,How do you express dark thoughts and can their expression be healthy at times?,"Given that their expression is not met with the action on what the thought is that is. Everyone has them but they are often not expressed due to the fear of being labeled as an individual that is either harmful to others or themselves. So right now when I say I want to get hit by a truck, it doesn’t mean that I’m going to literally take a walk on the Highway and wait for a truck but getting this off my chest certainly helps. I wish our society would be more allowing of us to share these thoughts and express them without labeling us as a danger to ourselves or others. Just simple hold space for getting all of this out. 

On another note, I wish I could say this to people in the moment when I am struggling like today: “I don’t want you to make me happy, I just want you to see me, treat me, love me, and respect me where I am at. You don’t have to give me advice or try to fix what is going on but I could use a hug and your company.

Thanks for reading y’all! &lt;3"
2566,Life is going to hell...,"    SO... I've been without like 99% of my family past 5 years prior to that was about 15 years aside small spurts.

Get a call from a close family friend that my 32 year old brother is dating a 40+ year old. They're both hooked on meth.

My 37 year old sister whom has previously lost 3 kids due to abuse is hooked on meth. Pregnant by a married methead.

My 40 year old sister whom constantly cheats on her husband is now addicted to meth. Her husband has severe anger issues. Often punching holes in the walls,  yelling or breaking stuff. They've got 2 kids... One is extremely timid always afraid he's going to get yelled at. The other the polar opposite. If you sit down,  he'll hit you and scream for the spot. If you move he'll follow. My sister's husband will make you move opposed to correcting the behavior. 

     Attop of that about 4 days ago, the same family friend had called me again. My Mother is in a FL hospital with COPD.

About 2 days later, I'm messaged she's in ICU

      Then to add the frosting to the cake,  I've been struggling with mental illness most of my life. Had a break down sometime last year. I've been trying to figure out meds,  I've tried ECT, recently stopped and started talk therapy. 

       I've got a 5 year old in MO I don't get to talk to much although he's literally is what keeps me alive. 

       Couldn't tell you the last time I've had clean laundry or bedding... It's been months. It's not the 1st time in my life seeing as I've been dealing with homelessness on and off since 14 -15. I'll be 34 come the 24th

It's still embarrassing to have to hide food stains or whatever else is on your clothes. Having to dig through your dirty laundry for something that looks ""clean"" won't really ask for help either. Don't want to be burden...

     I spend holidays alone,  as well as birthdays. Have for about the past 16 years.  They've lost there meaning...

Honestly if I could afford it,  I'd get that new Starwars game and a cheap six pack and sit quietly by myself for my 34th birthday,  and the next day Christmas. As I've said though... I couldn't even afford clean clothes. 

       Shit starts to take a toll.. I've got Complex PTSD, Social Anxiety / Panic disorder.  Severe depressive illness. Severe bipolar, and borderline personality disorder. 

Thank you for letting me rant...

2567,Secret Santa made me feel sh*t,"I’m a uni student and our flat did secret Santa. We all made dinner and after eating it together we went around the table taking it in turns to open our secret Santa presents. When all eyes were on me for the turn, there were no more presents left and the person who had me didn’t turn up or bother telling anyone he wasn’t. 
It sounds stupid but it really killed my mood, now I’m in my room trying to escape the embarrassment of being the only one to not get anything."
2568,Depression is about a feeling of everlasting shame,"There are moments where I can't stop tears from my eyes even though I try.

 But sorrow is stronger. And when this happens when I am next to my boyfriend I feel so embarrassed of myself that I can't say a simple word. I need a hug but I can't express it. I'm frozen in time gazing in the space and letting tears water my face and everything around me.

 I know he sees me as a weak person. Once he told me he would kill himself if he was me. That's why I feel so embarrassed of myself. And cannot say a word while having a mental breakdown next to him...

Being ashamed is the core of my being."
2569,I’m in love with a chronically depressed person and I’m struggling today. I’d appreciate something that could help me feel or deal better. I thought I’d find it here too.,"I am in love with someone who has dysthymia and they’ve been struggling for a while. We’re not together, per se, but we have something that sort of goes beyond just a standard friendship. I’ve been told this is called a situationship? I don’t know. All I know is that I love them, I want to be with them and I want to help them in every single way that I can but I know there’s nothing that I can really do. They just have to figure it out themselves but it’s just .... hard. I’m so happy and grateful to know this person. I truly love almost everything about them and I can’t describe to you the joy that they give me when we’re together but I’m often confused, frustrated and sad about the circumstances they and I are seemingly stuck in. 

I’m forever here for them as their friend, lover, partner. I love them as they are currently and I’m excited to watch them grow into a happier, more stable human being. I’m really optimistic about our future and despite everything they’re going through, they seem to have an open mind about us. We talk often, have great communication and I’m just so dedicated to them, it’s insane to me. I know in my heart we’ll be together and create something beautiful with one another. It’s just extremely hard on me some days to accept this isn’t the right time for them and today is one of those days where I’m really struggling. I just want to be with them and make their life so much easier, make them feel like they’re more than just a blank slate and make them feel, well, good. 

Anyway, I’ve been feeling lonely and I’m not sure who to talk to or how to talk about what I’m feeling because I feel so many chaotic emotions that I’ve never felt for anyone before. I’m hoping someone else has been through this frustrating situation as well in some way or another. 

TL;DR: I’m so in love with a chronically depressed person and while I understand the circumstances, I don’t know how to deal with anything, emotionally speaking. I’m having a hard day. 🙃"
2570,I'm a lazy piece of shit,"Tomorrow (monday) we want to go through our group project and how we want to present it in the break, but I didnt do my part. I couldn't really get out of bed the whole day and didn't even worked on my hugh assignment that's due next week. 
My problem is that eventhough my part in our group project doesn't take long to do but is the most important part about it and I'm feeling awful about not doing it. To top it all of do most of my friends not know about my mental health state and I dont know how to explain why I didnt do my work.
I hate myself rightnow and tbh just wanted to share it."
2571,Life isn't for me,I just fucking hate myself and I want to die. But i'm to scared to kill myself.
2572,"Old, depressed, suicidal &amp; helping others.","Every time I get on here I feel like i can't hold out any longer.  Then after reading everyone's posts I find myself trying to help them &amp; then end up feeling better myself. I think the cure is helping others.

 I'ts so sad to see all the young people &amp; college aged kids on here feeling suicidal. Usually it's over not having a date or stress from school. I know it's impossible to see right now but you have so much life ahead of you! Do your best in class, stay in shape, get a degree &amp; go do something exciting with your life. Any breakup will get better with time. 

 If you cant get a date then obsess yourself with exercise or anything that betters yourself. While everyone is out partying you will be improving yourself. Then in 10-20 yrs they will be out of shape, broken down &amp; you will be ripped, healthy &amp; able to enjoy life.

 For anyone that's alone or ignored, bullied in school;  Do you think Bill Gates or any of those types were popular in school? They were probably ignored &amp; laughed at, nobody is laughing at them now.

 I'm middle aged &amp; all the best looking women my age are with guys you wouldnt consider attractive &amp; most arent rich either.  As you get older things will totally flip flop from how they are in school. The ones that had no friends or dates will be the ones with the best jobs &amp; plenty of friends. Be yourself and be good to everyone.  Don't give up before you've even lived!"
2573,"For the first time in years, I'm having a good day!","I felt like shit for staying in bed until noon but I managed to take a shower and took an hour long walk outside. Damn, it feels good to be outside. It really brings me back to my childhood self, a simpler time when I had no anxieties and all I was doing was just staring at the clouds and fucking around. It also reminds me of how depressing staying at home is; all I do is sleep and waste daylight doing nothing on my phone."
2574,Avoiding responsibilities and done with living. This is my last cry for help. I’ve given up on myself.,"I’ve avoided the onboard process for a new job the past two weeks because I don’t feel good enough. I also haven’t studied for the mcat because I can’t read a single word without my brain telling me I’ll never make it. I’m so depressed and anxious every morning when I wake up. To everyone else I look fine but deep inside I feel hopeless and I’ve actually given up, I’ve been wanting to suicide for years and I think I might finally do it this week. 

I’m thinking what’s the point of living if all I’m gonna be is sad and afraid. I’ve been fighting this depression for more than 10 years and I feel like it’s all worthless at this point because the longer I live the worse my life and my brain becomes. I don’t know who else to talk to, I’ve talked to my sibling too much I’ve decided not to burden them anymore because I always say the same thing. Makes me wish I killed myself when I was younger.

Ive grown exhausted of myself. I just want to end it now. Posting here is my last hope and I feel like such a failure :("
2575,Nobody gives a damn about what I have to say.,"I'll be in the middle of talking and people will just...walk away. It happens so often it's actually kind of pathetically hilarious at this point. I've always considered myself quiet but not mousey, I never thought my voice was particularly quiet. Apparently it is, either that or people just really have no interest in what I have to say. Friday night I was speaking to one of the directors for the company I work for. I literally watched this man lose interest as his eye wandered around the restaurant until he settled on someone he thought was and old friend. He then walked away to go talk to this other person (who wasn't who he thought he was btw) while I was still in the middle of my sentence. Yesterday, one of the waitresses came up to me and started talking. I let her say her piece, and then I started to say mine. Again, just walked away in the middle of my sentence like I wasn't even talking. I could understand not hearing me but come on really? My lips were still moving! You knew I was still talking! We'll be standing together in a group; me, my 2 coworkers, and my supervisor. Every time I open my mouth and start a thought, I get cut off. Hell, again yesterday I was actually having a conversation with my supervisor and one of my coworkers came up to us, stuck his hand out at me and said ""excuse me"", and started a different conversation with my manager right in the middle of me finishing mine!! It wasn't like he cut me off because he had a work related question. No, he just genuinely thought his topic of conversation was that much more important than mine. Growing up, my grandpa would cut us off if he thought of anything to say in that moment because he thought what he had to say was more important that what any of the women had to say, so me, my mom, and my grandma are all pretty used to being cut off and ignored in conversation. Much more so for me because my mom has also picked up on that habit and has cut me off from speaking since I was a girl. Even my boyfriend has the same habit of blurting out whatever thought or topic of conversation comes to his head, regardless if you're finished talking or not. I have a cousin who's a f**king saint when it comes to letting me speak. If someone cuts me off when we're talking, she'll never break eye contact with me. She'll let the person speak and redirect the conversation right back to me so I can actually get ALL of my thoughts across. I've never really thought I was boring, and those who have actually bothered to get to know me say I'm good company, but it's so embarrassing getting cut off/ignored the way I do. It's gotten so bad over these past few months that I've started just writing all my thoughts down to get them out one way or another. I'll let people talk to me and I'll give just bare bones basic responses so if they walk away again I don't feel like an idiot for daring to conversate. I try testing the waters every now and then but as you can see people still just love to ignore me so we're going back to silence starting today. I'm tired of everyone asking me why I'm so quiet and reserved nowadays. Maybe take a step back and think about what made me this way. I'm sorry for ranting, but its getting so tiresome never being able to complete a thought. It hurts feeling like everything you say just falls on deaf ears. Wouldn't it be hilariously fitting if this got lost in the void of reddit too?"
2576,No one cares and that’s good,"Hi no one cares about anything and that’s good because nothing would change if they did.

Hell, even I dont care. I am obsessed with peoples opinions but at the end of the day it doesn’t matter because i hate myself nonetheless.

If only I could change. If only people wouldn’t leave me all the time. Maybe then I would feel like something was going right... but would I? Or would I still hate myself nonetheless?

I really hate how I am and I hate all the things going on right now. I don’t want to deal with it.

Greetings,
LTY"
2577,I've totally given up,"I honestly can't do this anymore, I feel so depressed. Everyday I do things to try distract myself and keep going but shit keeps happening and its just keeps going down hill. I legit try and convince myself tht shit will get better but ik it's all delusional trash. 
I opened up to my friend last night but fuck we hardly talked today, like I dunno she thinks I was exaggerating or some shit, fuckin hell. I never open up to people but when I do, I always fucking regret it. 
I try to occupy myself by watching anime or reading shit, but as soon as I'm alone with my thoughts I literally wanna cease to exist. My fam don't know shit and most of my friends are oblivious as fuck especially tht I act all happy cuz I don't wanna seem like an attention seeker. Me constantly trying to hold on to tht thread of hope fucking broke me, I tried so hard to be optimistic and shit but it's all delusion. At this stage I just do the bare minimum to stay alive, eat, toilet and Even showering is fucking hard. I just can't see the point in all this hell."
2578,Shaving My Head,"I don't know why, but I'm having the urge to completely shave my head off.

It feels like a bunch of weight is on my head, as if it's the source of my stress and depression.

My gf broke up with me recently, and a bunch of other stressful things happened, I don't know if this has anything to do with it.

I feel like shaving my head hoping for some new start or anything.


Off topic:
I have a 5 inch tall afro. In which I'm constantly complimented about, but people would see me as something to touch regardless."
2579,I feel so ungrateful and like a waste of space,"My friends keep constantly trying to cheer me up from my now ex and I still feel like absolute shit. I’ve been struggling with mental health my whole life. I basically told her this and indirectly took advantage of her. I wasn’t a full person but I tried my absolute best to love her as much as I could, but she left me and broke me.  I get this feeling like she wants me back and is hiding her true feelings for me, scared that I would hurt her again, but I really have taken steps to ensure that never happens again. Everything in my life seems perfect but there’s a huge hole in my head that’s shaped like her."

2583,Venting,"I feel lonely. Nah I AM lonely.

I dont know how to speak for myself or how to talk to others.

I cant get over this girl. She's controlling my life even though she's not in my life. Im just scared of anything that reminds me of her. Which is basicly everything. 

I hate myself for doing things i'd never imagine myself doing. Yeah bad things, not good ones. Finding out why I behaved this way only made my self image worse and made a vision of my future also  impossible.

I already lost faith in this world but have recently lost faith in myself aswell. Im lost."
2584,Just want to get this out,"I'm a 16 yr old boy from germany, been dealing with severe depression for over 3 years now and attempted suicide 2 times. My mom got really mad all the time and none but one of my friends supported me through this time. My psychiatrist made me go into a treatment at some clinic. I was there for roughly 4 months, just trying to get out in the last 2 months. So I swindled my way out by saying I'm fine and pretending to do really good. I got out and instantly my mom was mad at me for everything again, felt I was somehow magically perfect again. I went along, cause I don't want to talk to her. I've basically been crying myself to sleep every night since then. I started going to the gym and lost around 65lbs/30kg(was severely overweight). Now I'm a pretty jacked guy, almost have a Sixpack and am always the funny guy at parties. Nobody know I attempted suicide 3 weeks ago. My grades have gone from super bad to best in class. Everybody thinks I'm super happy and I would love my life. Honestly I hate myself. I just want to die all the time. I've also kinda developed feelings for this one girl. Everything's going really well and we already are Vining really well. After all, I am pretty good looking(Doesn't sound depressed ik)  and I treat people well. I just don't want to move on with her, because I don't want to lie to her about my past. I have a feeling, I will never get together with her because of my bad choices. I kinda wanna be the depressed fat kid again."
2585,"Latuda for dysthymia, double depression, atypical depression","All right so my doctor prescribed me latuda and I think it's bullshit. 
Everybody keeps trying to diagnose me as bipolar lite and I'm not, I'm not bipolar whatsoever.

I also learned about atypical depression which really hit home for me. I also have ADHD. I'm taking adderall, Klonopin, and 5 mg of Prozac. Does anybody else suffer from what I have? I have absolutely no mania. And if you do, could you tell me what medicines help you feel better? I feel like if I don't advocate for myself but just keep treating me like a lab rat and I'm just not here for that. 
My life: I take very little pleasure and most activities. I've been this way since I was a child. Very happy events can boost my mood but I usually go back to my regular low mood. I'm so used to my low mood that I assumed everybody else felt the same way until I realized they didn't. I'm smart and don't have a bunch of logical fallacies.
 I'm just trying to find someone who is like me bc I feel alone. 
Also I really think latuda isn't for me, any thoughts on that?
Ok thanks"
2586,I feel like I'm in the way...,"I feel like I'm just in the way around friends and family. Like I have no business there. I say something, and everyone looks at me like I'm a fucking lunatic. What did I do? I know I'm socially awkward, but am I that bad?"
2587,Self confidence,Has never been my strongest asset. Sometimes I feel like a burden and other times I feel like I’m not even wanted. I’m scared to reach out and I’m always saddened over the smallest things like the way someone looks at me or an unanswered text. I hope I can recover soon as I do not want this to consume me in my every waking moment
2588,Residual fatigue lasting years after depression?,"3 years ago I had depression, very bad to the point where I just wanted to die or disappear forever. It was a slow climb out of it. I do not have any depression symptoms anymore and haven't for 1.5 years, except :  

* fatigue   
* a bunch of physical symptoms that could be attributed to fatigue or another condition  (such as muscle spasms, visible arteries, neck pain, seeing 'stars' when standing up, etc)
* the fact that things are generally less fun which can be because of fatigue *or* because of depression.   

But note that I said *less* fun, I can still enjoy things unlike when I was depressed. Certain things like video games however, I just quit after 15 minutes because I don't really want to play it or don't have the energy to do so whereas it used to my biggest timesink in the past.    

I've tried various tests already but haven't found an underlying condition so far. So now I'm here, wondering if this is all caused by depression or not. Is it?"
2589,"Anyone ever feel like no one truly listens, despite people saying they’ll be there for you?",It’s disheartening and lonely when your ‘friends’ or family don’t go out of their way to check on you. at all
2590,How do I explain depression to my «normal» significant other?,"Hey
I’ve struggled with depression my entire life, ever since I was a small kid. I grew up in an abusive home, with two parents(one with BPD and the other was an abusive alcoholic) who hated eachother and a sister who would beat me up and get others to bully me. It was quite a hard childhood but I do feel like it has shaped me to become the person I am today, a caring being. However, the past years, my depression have started to get worse and its eating me from the inside, I have no one to talk to and my family would rather not talk about it. They only tell me I’m trying to be special or like my sister, who got diagnosed with BPD and depression which makes it harder for me to get help. The health system in my country sucks and theyre refusing to give me therapy.. 
I do have one good thing in my life and that is my girlfriend but the problem is,, I cant talk to her about it. She doesnt understand and is refusing to listen, which I dont blame her for since she had a very nice childhood and was spoiled with loving parents but its hard for me to get better when I’m not getting any support anywhere. I have talked to her about it but she just shrugs it off and tells me I should try to be happy and that «it could be worse» also making it about her,, «What do you think I have it like? Dating someone with depression? Its not easy for me either??» and that makes me even more depressed, because shes talking about me like I am a burden. We do not live together and whenever I am having a very bad day, she refuses to come over because ‘shes not my therapy animal’. Is it wrong to ask for support from her? Am I an asshole? She has her own problems that she has to deal with(alcoholism) but I am always there for her, carrying her home from when she drinks and passes out all the time. I’m always first to find her and help her but I feel like I’m not getting the same support back. How do I express how it feels like to be me, to a person whos clueless? how do I explain my depression in words she will understand? Anyone else here struggling with their S/O’s on the same topic?"
2592,Ever feel like you don't belong in this world anymore?,I struggle with the thought that I just dont belong in this world anymore it's as if I've forgotten how to be human I struggle every day with everything that used to come automatically to me sometimes I just feel so exhausted it's not worth the effort to even leave the house
2593,"I really, really don't want to be here","I'm only staying alive for my mum. When she's gone, I'll go to. I don't find enjoyment in anything anymore and I feel as if I'm dragging myself around everywhere. I just feel so dead."
2594,Why pick up the pieces?,Everything's just going to get ruined again later on.
2595,Boyfriend with depression not communicating,It’s my birthday today and not heard from my boyfriend since Tuesday. He suffers from depression and said he needed space. What can I do? I’m trying to be strong but finding it so hard. Not even received a message to say Happy Birthday. I didn’t think I’d be so hurt by it but am so upset. Anybody that suffers from depression...when you’re in a dark place...would you choose to not speak to your gf on their birthday?
2596,People has no such thing as a Heart.,"The more you involve yourself , the more you lose yourself.

Animals for survive need to eat another one .

Vegans eat plants who are living things too.


Even if we return to the non-existence state we still exist in a certain way .

In religion if you don't worship the god you go to hell. But we didnt even choose to be here or to ne created.

For survive you need to obey and do stuff that you  don't want to do.

We don't even have the right to kill  ourselves/escape from this world because death may be painful."
2598,"My friends care, but I don’t","Today my 2 great friends decided to hang out downtown because theirs nothing else to do in our shitty town, and they invited me. I said no and went back to bed. One of them then called me about 2 hours later and I ignored it. About half an hour later I texted him out of curiosity (he called me immediately, which I ignored) and he said they where gonna come to my house and wait outside until I came to hang with them. They didn’t end up doing this because I didn’t respond, but I would’ve just ignored them had they decided to. They really do care about me but I couldn’t give less of a fuck about myself. I’m perfectly content to stay at home all day and be miserable. If I went with them, I would’ve been maybe ok for 4-5 hours then came home and felt awful and then school tomorrow would have come sooner. I honestly don’t know why they even bother, I’m a lost cause."
2599,I always wonder if people who were outgoing and happy in high school are still happy to this day,are they truly thriving ? all i see on social media are people making memes about ‘being depressed’. i wonder if it’s true cause it feels like a lot of people are going through a rough time. Or is it just people romanticizing mental illness?

2601,The word suicide has been floating around my head all day,"Usually, I can ignore my suicidal thoughts, but in the past few days, they have gotten so much more frequent and today the word suicide is something that I can’t get out of my mind no matter how hard I try. Yesterday night, I decided to stop swimming and just let the waves of depression overtake me, and I think it’s the first part of me drowning, but I just wanted to get it off my chest because I’ve been holding it in all day. Sorry for cluttering your feed."
2602,"TL;DR: I know that I've annoyed everyone around too much, so I have decided that I will not start any conversation by myself","Nobody cares about what I think about anything. Every time I start talking about something or join the conversation I feel with my skin that everyone involved wish me shut up and go away. At work, with my friends who reaching out to me less and less often, random people who I met five minutes ago, everyone. When there is a discussion and everyone is offered to express their thoughts on some topic I feel that everybody secretly rolls their eyes when I try to say something. 

I know that I can be nerdy and pay too much attention to details, but god damnit. I just fed up with this, I don't even want to talk to anyone at this point. 

I don't want my friends, I don't care about my coworkers. Nothing will be brought up by me that is not related to the work. I'll spend every coffee break staring at Reddit, playing Minecraft on smartphone and sipping coffee. Nobody will suffer from me ignoring them. I had enough hints that I am unwanted. 

I could look like a dick behaving like this, but I don't care. To look like a dick or to be annoying prick? What a choice, lol. 

I was deeply introverted all my life, and then people around me demanded that I must change that. I guess it's time for me to show that old me was better."
2603,Once i’m happy it’ll probably feel like i just woke up from a long long coma,by the time i’m better my youth will be gone. feels like i’ve been locked in a dream for so long. i ruined so many things by being depressed.
2604,Do you ever feel people get bored of you being depressed?,"Anyone else experience this? You tell someone how you're feeling, they actually listen to you and manage to make you feel better in the moment. One week later, you tell them you don't want to go out or something as you're feeling down again, and they get pissed off that you're not better all of a sudden"
2605,How do you make life better when you're the problem?,"It seems like no matter what I do in my life, I either fail or inadvertently hurt someone else. I'm very clearly the cause of my own life falling apart, I just wish I knew why I can't do anything right. I'm just trying my best to make it through the day, but it's really hard to keep going when I keep accidentally hurting the people I love.  


I wish there was a way to quietly remove myself from the equation. I know that killing myself while still having these people in my life will cause more pain, but I feel like it would be a lump sum payout, rather than constant daily payments with heavy interest."
2606,Have you?,"Have you ever felt like there is no help? Like there is nothing nor no one to help you feel somewhat alive? Have you ever felt? Because once I did... But I forgot. I honestly am empty, way too empty. Hopefully getting a gun tomorrow and ending myself for good. I hope none of y'all feel like I do because it's honestly not pleasant. Bye!"
2608,Aaaaaah. Im stuck w myself.,When did this happen?  How did i get so lost in my own mind?  How the fuck do i get out of this? Is there even a way out????  Why is this misery so comfortable??  My own self is my worst enemy and so even when im winning im actually losing. Damn.  Bro like wtf
2609,I feel like im dying but im not?,"I guess its just depression but i keep having this feeling like im waiting to die.

Ive been on medication for epilepsy for years... its really scattered my brain.

I dont feel like anything is worth doing.. not even videogames or eating. I cant stop losing weight

Some days i just want to pass out and fall on the floor so i can go to the hospital... maybe they can tell me whats wrong with me but im afraid theyll say everythings fine

I dont belong anywhere or mean anything... im really starting to let go of everything... maybe thats why it feels like im dying... i am in a way.

It just me or do yall every feel this way"
2610,i keep playing out all these dumb fantasies in my head and it’s actually kind of relaxing,"i’d imagine that i was the popular kid, lots of friends, going to parties, doing dumb shit and not really caring about anything else other than having a good time. it distracts me from the reality that i have to live in, which is kinda the opposite"
2611,I have so much stuff to do but the thought of how lonely I am keeps me from doing it,"I have college apps that I have to submit , my online quiz due tmr , a test I need to study for , a book I should’ve been reading for the past month , a project due and I’ve just been sitting in bed doing nothing ( Ik it’s on me for procrastinating ) but god I don’t have the energy to do anything. It just feels like nothing is getting better."
2612,Being alive with depression is so weird,"People tell you there’s so much to look forward to, there’s so many beautiful things.. then where are they? Because I don’t see them. Am I living in a different dimension why don’t I see it the way you do?"
2613,Anyone feel like they just aren’t made for society.,"I just can’t seem to do things right. I struggle keeping friends and girls always ghost me. I really don’t know what to do. I’m so depressed from being kicked down over and over. I don’t know how to get out of this hole.

I just can’t get anything right. Wish I was normal."
2614,what should i do,i’m scared of myself and i don’t know what to do. depression is terrifying. i need someone in my life to have their hand on my shoulder and to tell me hey it’s going to be okay. what do i do? my chest and body don’t feel right. it feels like my body is trying to go by itself and leave. the only thing that feels like it’s stopping me is my physical form from disappearing. nothing helps..
2615,Birthday Blues,"I know it's late and the time had gone
But I'll do anything I can
To be made differently than I am

I want to love myself but I suck, dude
It's like was meant to be someone else
But I'm stuck being me
I want to feel different than I do

I was born today 24 years ago and I wish I wasn't."
2616,Teenage boy with depression,What do you do when the few people you trusted don’t even believe that you’re depressed simply because you’re male even ignoring the scars on your wrist
2617,Does anyone get upset at the sight of gorgeous people?,"My head problems are deeply rooted in my looks. It's been like this since I was at a young age where I was constantly told I was basically a fat ogre. I've lost weight, and it sound so incel esque, but godammit sometimes when I am deep into my thoughts it just pisses me off. They cant help it, but it still bothers me nonetheless."
2618,I have no place here.,"I'm stranded on this planet, among these monkeys who call themselves intelligent. They are far from that. They are clever enough to try and understand the world around them, but they have failed miserably to understand themselves. They fight with one another instead of living peacefully and happily. They know nothing of true happiness. I pity the few others like me, trapped on this nightmarish planet. If some other lifeform can read this.. please save us! Please save the few experiences worthy of existing! I beg of you, don't let me rot here, I won't last much longer. I can't be a part of this madness. It's too much for my being, I'm nothing like these barbarians, I wish nothing but for everybody to be happy! I don't want to suffer, or see others do it. I want to see smiles, hear laughter, hug and kiss people. Please.. save us!"
2621,I'm tired.,"I need to kill myself because maybe then I won't be such a disappointment. Maybe then I won't waste my parents' resources. Maybe then they can live their lives without my pitiful existence. Maybe they can finally be happy because there is no burden on their backs anymore. At this start of this year before I moved back in with them I knew this would be a rough year for me and I was already contemplating killing myself after my birthday. Somehow I've made it this far because of the things I used to love. 

It's only natural that catalysts for my suicidal thoughts start coming up at the end of the year. Maybe this is when I was supposed to die. I can't change who I am and I can't be who they want me to be but they won't understand that and keep making me feel more and more like a mistake. My mental health is a ""gimmick"". I might as well prove to them that it isn't. Maybe with my second suicide attempt, they will realize that I'm not pretending to be sad and unmotivated all the time.

I'm really tired of living. It's so fucking exhausting. I'm drained mentally and emotionally. I don't want to do it anymore."
2622,Suicidal thoughts,I could never do it to my family and friends but I sure as hell don’t want to live in the slightest this way. Nobody can help me but myself. I think I’ll set a 365 day challenge to try to find myself and graduate college then fuck life. Gah no I can’t but I want to but I can’t I’m such a boring quiet waste of space. Even when other people tell me they’re depressed they can at least speak properly and hold conversations I hate how this depression affects everyone so differently. Just needed to get this out
2623,"Ladies and Gentlemen it’s, RANT TIME! (Also important question at the bottom)","I’m so freaking pissed right now! Basically, I took the time and effort to make beef stew, mashed potatoes, and dinner rolls on Friday. Well, today my dad decided to eat basically all that was left of the mashed potatoes, because he claims he doesn’t feel good and that’s all he can eat right now. Then he starts telling me what I should do  differently with the stew next time I make it. And to be honest, I don’t recall him ever saying thank you for me making it all. Not to mention we had important plans that he cancelled this morning, as usual. So forgive me if I’m not in the mood to hear him criticize anything I do right now. Then he tells me I should make mashed potatoes out of the red potatoes I put in the stew. Which I’ll be honest, I’ve never made mashed potatoes out of red ones before. Only russet potatoes. Then he starts yelling about how they’re all the same and how he wants skin left on them, cause I peel them. I say I don’t like them that way and he then he says he doesn’t know why I “insist on bit**ing about it.” And makes a few other nitpick remarks about it. 

I was also thinking of giving some to a friend who may have bronchitis, but then I remembered he also doesn’t like it when I give other people food. You know, people who are going through tough times and could use it? Or just out of kindness? He’s literally guilt tripped me out of it a couple times. He’s been all like, “Don’t give away MY food that I paid for!” 

So basically I take the time to put together a nice dinner and this is what I get in return. Not only did he eat practically all of it in a short period of time, and left barely any for me, but then he COMPLAINS about it! And I get called the bit** for not wanting to make more. Literally he got mad at the fact I didn’t wanna make more mashed potatoes right at this moment, like they don’t take any time at all. I don’t feel like doing it and I don’t wanna hear it. I’m too freaking irritated right now, and I know he’s not gonna care. As long as he’s pissed, that’s all that matters. My feelings? Pointless.

I guess I’ll make the potatoes at some point even though I’m pissed off. Cause if I don’t, I’m gonna have to deal with what resembles a five year old throwing a tantrum. Cursing and screaming and all.

I do have one question for any one who reads this though. Does this sound like manipulation? Someone expecting you do something a certain way and then criticizing you/getting angry or threatening to be when you don’t do it? Cause I’ve been dealing with this kind of behavior my whole life. And in varying situation/to varying degrees? What would you say?"
2624,Is there a term for people who enjoy feeling depressed?,"says it all in the title, I enjoy being suicidal, changes the way I think, so wondering if theres a term to describe this."
2625,How do I help a depressed friend?,"So someone I truly care about is suffering from depression and he doesn't really know how to open up. 
I want to help but I just don't want to tell him the generic stuff because I've heard that all my life and its never helped. 
So how can I help him considering we live in different towns and can't be physically there for him?"
2626,Struggling with over eating,"Hi

I've been struggling for years with anxiety and depression, I haven't always been the best eater when I was 16 I heavily restricted food as punishment, then went the opposite way and started binge eating. Until recently, I've had a relatively normal relationship with food but always had to be careful of what I eat because I gain weight very easily.

After a few setbacks with my mental health recently, I've turned to food to make me feel better and I've gained 10 kg. This is on top of steadily gaining weight over the past two years so now I'm the heaviest I've ever been. I wouldn't say I'm binging as such as I used too, but if I'm alone and having a bad day I will sit and eat large bars of chocolate, or McDonald's etc but it's all in the mindset to try make myself feel better. How do I stop these feelings and try not turn to food so much?

The weight gain itself is making me feel really bad about myself. I feel really unattractive to my boyfriend and feel like he's not as sexually attracted to me anymore. My self esteem is really low which isn't helping my mood in general. I just feel so greedy and out of control. 

I've recently started anti depressants so perhaps that's a factor too. I do go to the gym and swimming but find it hard keeping a routine with exercise because of my job and the medications I'm on can often make me feel a bit too dizzy at times to really work hard at the gym. Aside from the urges to eat to make myself better I don't tend to have a bad diet."

2629,Do people actually be happy after ”recovering”?,"Hello, i have had depression for 1 year, first symptoms came about 5 years ago. I’m 16 years old and can’t go to school cause i hate being there and am tired 24/7. I think this is never ending. I have been on medication for 6 months and been on therapy for about 2 months now, 2 times a week. I think depression never ends, i just can’t see a future, it just simply isn’t there. I will never be happy, i’m not good in anything and i feel like if i somehow keep going i’ll end up working in a job i hate. I would rather die than do something i don’t want to. Is there really a future if you’re in a situation like this? I don’t think so."

2632,Im just so sick and tired of it all,"I fucking swear people just fucking hate me or im always in the fucking wrong and at this point im going for the 2nd one because ive never had true people on my side 

And i have to go to fucking school and if i show

And its like its the same shit always its your not trying hard enough,your being awkward,stop being so fucking sad for no reason like i dont already fucking now like i dont get reminded every two seconds that i cant function like everybody else"
2633,I don't want to be alive anymore but I can't bring myself to actually plan a suicide attempt,"Sorry if this starts to become word vomit. I've never been good at expressing how I feel.

I've been depressed since I was 14, I'm 17 now. No one takes me seriously anymore. I starting self-harming when I was 15, but I stopped the same year I started because it was my last cry for help, when my mom attempted to get me into therapy I thought it was all finally over, I was finally going to get help. I never got help. I was left to let my depression continue to get worse, and now I'm at the point where I wish I was dead. My siblings constantly push me and my parents don't do anything about it. They watch my siblings make fun of me and constantly hit me. I'm physically disabled, I have 16 discs in my spine fused. I can't fight back. I just have to take it and hope for once someone will do something about it. I'm not religious but I pray every day to whatever god is out there that someone will make all of this stop. I want to end it all but I don't know how. I have medical insurance but no way of getting myself to a therapist because I can't drive, both out of fear of driving and not having someone who is willing to help me learn how to drive. 

My family constantly makes fun of me. They like to throw around homophobic and transphobic jokes and call me things like retarded. 

I just want to be happy. I just want to make it to 18 and be able to leave, but it's starting to feel like that's never going to happen. It seems like every time I see a doctor I'm being diagnosed with something else that's going to make it harder and harder for me to be independent and be able to live on my own some day."
2635,My female best friend who I have known since we were 13 is getting married next spring,"I’ve always liked this girl, and I think she knows that. I’ve asked her out twice when we were 18-19 and she didn’t want to ruin the friendship, but we had a pact where if we were both single at 30, we’d get married. Right now we’re both 28 and she’s been with a 34 year old guy for two years who just proposed to her recently and she said yes. I’m happy as hell for her but I always thought I’d end up with this girl, but I guess this is it. I texted her and told her  “truth be told I always thought we’d end up together but I’m so happy for you” and she replied saying thanks and what hurt me is when she said she thought we would too. What happened? Where did things go wrong? Between me and you reddit I’m absolutely gutted right now. We are having dinner tonight together, but I’m not going to say or do anything weird. I’m going to have a good meal with her but after tonight I’m going to distance myself from her. Maybe moving on will help with my depression. I’ll miss her"
2636,"Wherever I go, I imagine my own death.","Wherever go, I imagine my own death. It is happening in normal everyday situations.For example, seeing someone sitting in a car with a running engine and thinking about how he would run over me. Or walking by an open car bonnet/hood and thinking about how it explodes. By just seeing people, I imagine them stabbing, shooting or just beating me to death. Even in my house, thinking about a burglar breaking in to kill me.At home, the thought of it comes less, but I'm also not scared of leaving the house.

I imagine myself dying before I actually have this situation happening and as soon as I survived it, the next thought comes up.

Most of the time I am not even scared of the situation, I pretty much know I will survive, but the scenes in my head are the scary part. It can be brutally which is the scary part. And when one brutal scene comes up out of nowhere, the next ones keep getting brutal on this level.
 
Since I don't want to look for professional help, even though it might be helpful, I just want to know a name, what it might be called the thing happening in my head. I want to connect with others who have the same thoughts and exchange what helped to not think about it.
I feel helpless."
2637,I don't want to try anymore.,"I just... I can't win. My relationship with the love of my life ended today. My family doesn't talk to me much. I have little to no friends. I hate my job. I'm in a ton of debt from an accident earlier this year. I don't know what I'm doing wrong... I've tried medication, therapy and I can't seem to do nothing but get kicked down.

I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried exercising, tackling my fears, stepping out of my comfort zones, meeting new people.... I don't know what else to do.

I don't want to try anymore. My atheistic beliefs of entropy destroy me everyday and feel utterly alone... I... I'm so done with feeling this way.

This is my hail mary. Turning to strangers for guidance. Help, please... I'm so lost."
2638,Don’t click on this if you are depressed,"The title is titled that way because I don’t want to spread my depression and give anyone who already has this condition my ideas. 

I want to kill myself when I turn 30. I hate life and I feel like all my friends and family will pretty much be gone by then. 30 lets me experience life for a while. I won’t of course because I feel that it is a sin in Christianity to do so. I also don’t want my family or anyone around me to feel guilt. I have no idea why I exist of really why anything happens. Life just feels bleak. I don’t want anyone who reads this to feel responsible to respond to me. I’ll get though this I just want those who are comfortable to talk, to talk to me."
2639,i can’t do it anymore,i’m done struggling. this will be my last few days alive. i fuck up everything i do. my life has been shattered to pieces after coming out as transgender. i’m so fucking stupid. i shouldn’t have never come out. my family abandoned me. people harass me constantly. i barely make enough money to eat. suicide is my only answer.
2641,Why do antidepressants have to suck so bad?,"Psychiatrists be like: ""here's a pill that might help, but you're going to feel worse in every way imaginable for the first 4-6 weeks and then you *might* feel slightly better, if not, we'll try something else and start this all over again. Oh and if you miss a day of meditation, youre going to feel worse than your depression ever made you feel. Oh and you can't orgasm anymore. Good luck! """
2643,I feel like I’ve lost both my childhood and my future to depression.,"I’ve been depressed since I was a child, around 7 or 8. It’s been 9-10 years now, and I feel like I’ve missed out on so much because of it. I’m a 17 year old girl, and I feel as if my childhood and teenage years have been taken away from me because of my depression. I haven’t experienced going out with friends, I haven’t experienced going on dates or anything of the sort. I can’t get out of bed anymore and even just leaving the house takes hours of effort and most days I still can’t bring myself to do that. I can’t remember my childhood at all or any good memories and it sounds like such a stupid thing but it fucking hurts honestly. I feel like I didn’t get to have a childhood or grow up properly, I was forced to mature too young. 

My future seems bleak, I can never think about the future without panicking and getting thrown back into the spiral of suicidal thoughts that I’m trying to hard to get out of. The future is just terrifying to me. I don’t know how to cope, I genuinely feel as if I’m better off dying. I don’t even want to live past the new year. Every single day of my life I want to kill myself just to make it stop and I,, fuck. I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore."
2644,please help me,i cant stop crying WHY WONT ANYONE HELP ME PLEASE JUST HELP ME PLEASE HELP ME PLEASE HELP ME
2647,"The cashier at Ralph’s just asked me, “How’s your day going?”",And I almost started crying.

There are angels out there..."
2649,I'm sick of being unable to work hard anymore.,"I used to be able to work on projects for hours and hours, even if they didn't fully interest me. I had talent. I had perseverance.

Now I'm just fucking useless. It's gone. Everything that made me unique has vanished and I feel in my heart that I'm never going to get it back. 

I'm not talking about motivation, I'm talking about severe cognitive decline. Something that feels permanent.

I'm not seeing the point anymore in continuing on. I can't keep doing this. If this doesn't change, if I can't make it change, then I'm cashing in.

I'm just so fucking tired."
2650,I can only cry when I'm drunk.,"I'm going to say it now, this will probably be a long post, but I was in the mood to let it out. So, if you manage to read this whole thing, thank you.

So, I have this really bad habit of just bottling everything up and refusing to address any of it. I tell myself, it isn't a big deal, I don't need to burden anyone with my silly problems.

 But I've been a fairly heavy drinker since I was about 19. I went through a pretty nasty relationship. He was an alcoholic and to escape the abuse the best way I could, was to also drink. I'm now 26. I went through a lot of crazy shit to get to where I am now. I'd like to say that I'm doing better, and I am in a lot of ways. I'm not self destructing but I've merely just turned into a functioning alcoholic. I only drink a few times a week but I have to do it or I'm miserable. I tell everyone I'm doing it for fun, this is my way of unwinding. It really isn't. They buy it of course. Why wouldn't they? I guess I do a good job of fooling everyone, but my depression tells me it's just because they don't care enough to see it any other way. So it's easier to just believe the lie, I guess.

I also need to drink to cry. I need it to let out all of those things I bottle up so tightly. When I'm sober, it's so hard for me to let out any emotion, besides anger. It's fairly easy for me to be angry when I'm sober. That emotion is also stronger when I'm drunk. So I turn into this crying, insane, angry mess. I just let it all out. I always feel so much better afterwards. I'm highly aware of how unhealthy it is. I've looked into plenty of coping mechanisms. Gym, read, write, go for a walk, crafting. All that stuff is great. I just don't have the energy and motivation to do it half the time. That makes me angry. Like, come on I really want to do something productive. Instead I stay in bed and just feel sorry for myself and hate myself even more. Everything is a chore. Bathing, eating, going to doctors appointments. Except for drinking. I'm always motivated to do that. I like the way I feel when I'm drunk. I'm social, it gets me out of the house (because I go to the bar) I can let out my emotions. I know it's unhealthy. I know I need help. I guess it's just easier for me to stay at the bottom this time, instead of crawling my way back up."
2651,Feeling really sad doesn’t equal feeling depressed because depression isn’t just a feeling.,"If you say you feel depressed, then you also feel depressed for no reason not just because something isn’t working out for you."
2652,"It's such a horrible feeling being heartbroken by someone, but not being able to be mad at them.","Really just an irrational rant probably but I'm really hurt and every part of me wants to go off on them and let them see how much they've hurt me but i know it isn't their fault. I can't blame someone for something they didn't intend to do. This makes it so much worse and i feel so helpless and trapped. 

There's literally nothing I can do but wait and try to get over it and it hurts so fucking much."
2653,Feeling Stuck,"Been struggling with depression and drinking all year especially, trying to find an antidepressant that works. Been depressed for years now but what I'm on is only working enough to make me realize how much time I've wasted. Finals went poorly and college only made things worse, but now that it's over I don't really know what to do with myself."
2654,“Someone has it worse”,Anyone wanna share their opinion on this bs concept? I’m losing my mind every time my parents and teachers said that “there are kids more miserable than you and you should be grateful for what you have” because it’s like telling me that I can’t be sad because there are kids out there that are much sadder than me.
2655,It only takes one thing.,"I love my job.
I love my body.
I love where I live.
I (thought) I loved my boyfriend, but I think he is the reason that I feel the way I do. We live together, but I dont see much of him during the week bc our schedules are very different. The only day we have off together is Sunday, and EVERY Sunday we fight. He always tells me it is my fault and that I ruin every week, and I dont know how much more I can take of it. 6 days a week, we are fine, but Sundays are like hell on earth."
2656,My mom broke down on the way to see me last night,"My mom was coming to see me in SF for the first time that wasn’t related to surgery appointments earlier in the year. I’ve been here for about a year, she’s never just come to visit so I was very excited. I am so depressed here as it is with my job and this city, I had an awful week last week and I had a massive breakdown. All I was looking forward to was my mom visiting and just getting to spend time with her. December is the only time of year I get two days off in a row too, so I was happy to have the time. 

On the way here her car started to act weird so she had to turn home and it died. My mom has MS and it was already big she was trying to make it out even though it was late in the day when she could come. I’m just so sad that she couldn’t make it here. I had ordered pizza for us to be ready when she got here since it would be quite late. So instead of hanging out with my mom I have spent my time in my room, eating this pizza I couldn’t actually afford but wanted to do something nice, listening to my roomate and her mom had a good time and do whatever stuff hanging out around the house having a good mother daughter time. 


This is literally just a drop in the bucket at this point, my mom is literally the most important person in my life and I don’t get much time with her. Our family has fallen apart this year, I’ve lost so much and my job makes me feel the worst I have ever felt about everything. Even down to the small things. I hate SF, it’s hard, it’s expensive, it’s gross, it’s not where I want to be. I have 6 months left of my lease, I can’t wait for it to be over. I need this part of my life to be over because nothing is going even okay. I just can’t stand it. I couldn’t even have the relief of spending time with my mom after everything. I just can’t believe that happened, and I hate that she has to deal with a broken car now too. 

I just can’t believe this is my life. I don’t understand how I’m alive through all of this because every second of being here makes me want to die."
2657,"Need some advice, save me from depression.","It's my story, but I am sure there must be thousands of other people like me. My mom thinks that I am a quiet person. I don't like to talk to my parents because I can not connect with them(They are very old school).  I have many friends but I don't have a best friend whom I can talk to about anything and be vulnerable in front of . I am single and I find it quite hard to open up my heart in front of my male friends(idk why, but may be as the social norm is that you have to be the dude). And I have no girlfriend. But everything else is going normal. Like I am in a very good college, I go to gym regularly, I am working for a job very hard.
But the thing is I don't have someone to whom I can share what's going in my mind. There are people whom I call, but there is no one to whom I can connect.Lets face it, society potrays boys need to be emotionally tough, always the provider(in at least India it's true)
So I am like a emotional cylinder in which pressure is building up.. I desperately need to talk to someone. I have been in depression in the past and I am feeling like I am currently going to depression. Any advice?"
2658,IM SO FUCKING ANGRY,"i’m seething with anger but also sadness thinking of everything. Getting left on read when i speak about my problems, pushing people away because they don’t understand, angry with MYSELF. i’m spiraling"
2659,No one cares about me.,My only friend is living like shit and depressed too so I can't talk to him about my problems. My family doesn't fucking care either
2660,The pain of my loved one who left me is slowly killing me,"First off, I am so glad that people can write here about their troubles and receive so much positive support.

You guys are the best.

I am studying at university and more than a year ago I met a woman that was absolutely the best looking I have ever seen and so funny and we dated for a while. She left me after a few weeks for reasons I still don't know, everything was going so good. She was really into me and she just changed course by the flick of a finger.

Sadly we study the same programme, work at the same fraternity and share common friends so I see her way more often than I should. Everytime I see her I die a little more inside and the pain has gone on now for so long that I just can't take it anymore. Should I see her with another man that would absolutely kill me. Some time ago the pain became so unbearable when I saw her during a night out with some guys that I became suicidal.

It feels like I am at road's end because I have no idea how I can go back to the healthy-minded individual I was before. None of the methods I try seem to stave off the emotional pain. It's the worst after I have been drinking heavily. I just want to go back to who I was and not care about her.

Thank you so much for reading. All the best to you."
2661,Do any of you get bad depression headaches?,Whenever i feel sad or mentally drained my head just starts pounding.. Anyone else?
2662,Fear Of Abandonment Is Destroying My Life,"Idk if the title is overkill, but it's really how it feels right now. For frame of reference I have a long and unfortunately very decorated history of people abandoning me, leaving me behind, or just ghosting me all together. And now and day's I find myself freaking out and nearly having panic attacks every time my friends so much as head off for the night i start to feel a pit in my chest, and I fear each night might be the last one. But I become so stressed being around them and hanging out. I worry i'm taking up unneeded space, or that I'm overstepping my boundaries and that eventually they'll get sick of me. I fear coming to close but i also fear them leaving me. I don't know what to do, I don't want to come off as clingy, or creepy, but I fear I'm losing the people I care about the most. I hardly get sleep anymore or get through a day without panicking about this, and I feel so weak because of my actions. Am I being terrible?"
2663,I think today I'm actually going to do it.,"All my doctors told me that I won't get anywhere in life and that I should be locked up in an insane asylum.







Not one person ever cared about me, my entire fucking life. I'm done. Fuck the whole mental health industry. They treat us like fucking garbage. I never had a single bond or connection with anyone, and now I'm going to die alone with no friends. Fuck you world, if I had just one friend I'd maybe feel better but I can't take it anymore. Everyone tells me to kill myself so maybe I should just fucking do it."
2664,Headaches on Wellbutrin (after eating),"I‘m on day 24 of 150mg Wellbutrin (bupropion) right now. After eating in the morning I always get that strange strong and annoying but toleratable headache. Is that normal? 

To that I must say that 1 week ago I quit paxil (40mg daily), phenibut (2-6g daily) and nicotine (not much, sometimes none, never more than 5 cigarettes daily).

Is this a normal side effect? I mean I‘m in the third week of wellbutrin. Normally the side effects should vanish after maybe 1-2 weeks?

Thank you very much and have a great day!"
2665,Any tips,I am sick of waking up unhappy. I'm sick of having panic attacks. I'm sick of feeling like a let down and worthless. I just want to go back to being the happy girl I used to be. But I'm rarely truly happy. I want to be able to smile and it's a true smile. I'm tired all the time. I sleep all the time. I have no motivation. I used to be a hardcore gamer and now I don't even turn my expensive pc on. Honestly I am losing it and I don't know what to do.
2666,Worst month of my life.,"December 2019 has been the worst month of my young 20-year old life. So far this year has been good, I’m in my second year of university and getting great grades, I recently (&lt;6 months) starting dating this amazing girl whom I love, I finally got my license and saved enough money to quit my job and focus on my hobbies, one of which is powerlifting at the gym at my university.

Until December 2019. I was forced to drop a course (for personal reasons), my grandfather died and I had to fly out for his funeral. I had three (four, but I had to drop a course) finals that week, and I was forced to do one of them on the plane and defer another one. I didn’t do too great on any of them. Two days after I got back I was in a car crash with my girlfriend, in my mother’s car. It is going to cost me my life savings, (re: roughly 6k increase a year for insurance because the guy wouldn’t accept a cash payment for damages), and I’m pretty sure she hates me now. To top it off, I haven’t been able to go to the gym in almost a month and a half because of school, and since I have a habit of stress eating, I’ve gained almost thirty pounds and I’m starting to see stress marks. 

Tl;dr: In the first two weeks of December 2019, I may have broken my relationship, wasted all my money, got fat, didn’t get the grades I wanted, crashed someone else’s car and lost my grandfather. My mental state is at an all time low and I think about what a failure I am almost constantly. What do I do? :("
2667,Being a loser,"The worst part a out being as ugly as I am is when see an attractive woman I will immediately feel bad. Thought patter goes like this, ""well she is pretty...who cares what you think is attractive. ....., Oh well...""

2668,Husband easily irritated with my self deprecation.,Title says it all. Can’t go to husband with my thoughts and feelings because they’re always the same. I wish I could be alone so it at least reflected how I feel.
2669,People usually don't take my depression seriously,"I often put makeup on, not much - you know, just covering my acne and doing eyebrows, sometimes also my eyes, that's all, but it makes me look better. Sometimes I'm too tired or I just can't look at myself in the mirror, so I don't wear makeup and I look worse then - visible dark circles, worse complexion, I'm probably also more pale, I don't really know. And some people ask then ""did something happen? you look bad"", ""sleepless night, huh?"", ""having a hard time? you don't look well"" - like yeah, I'm straight up not having a good time, as always. I'm always bad, I'm always depressed, I wanna kill myself everyday, no matter how I look or how good I seem to be. But when I look better on the outside, no one really cares. I may say that I feel bad or I've been having a hard time, but others will be like ""naah, you don't look so bad"", ""you're overreacting, things can't be that bad"". And I just don't get this. I could be the most beautiful person on this fucking world, always look perfect and *still be depressed*. Because it's not about what's on the outside. I hate the fact that so many people around me can't understand this simple fact."
2670,Can anyone relate?,"Both my parents were substance abusers especially my mom, and I was born a premature lad, thankfully, with no serious health complications. My parents have been absent most of my life but thankfully I had the support of my family for the physical aspect of my life. I've grown to defy the odds set by my parents, but till this day Im damaged emotionally and mentally. I never ever talk about my life to friends, and thus I do not have anyone's shoulder to cry on. However, I never let anyone too close to me as I have a fear of getting hurt or being judged. 

I really wish I had someone with a similar background to talk too, which is why I joined Reddit."
2671,"I tried ""putting myself out there"" and failed miserably.","I don't know if I have depression or not since I have never met a therapist,  but a few people on other subreddits have told me I might since I have had suicidal thoughts. I have had so many of them that I thought this was normal. Anyways, whenever I bitch about myself, the biggest advice I get is to just put myself out there. I failed...miserably. 

I tried. I really tried. I don't think I can do this.

This is for both seeking friends and romance. I always heard I had to put myself out there for either, but I have no idea what to do once that happens. 

So, I have talked about my loneliness on reddit before. You may have even read about me. I'm that 23 year old who hasn't had a single meaningful friendship since elementary school. I am still a virgin who has never been on a date or kissed a girl. I have never even asked a girl out because I have never flirted and am socially inept. I have even have an imaginary girlfriend as a coping mechanism for how bad I feel about myself when lonely in my studio every weekend night. I have had thoughts if ending it all before (before I found purpose in this new job I recently started that I deeply enjoy). Yup, I'm THAT loser.

Well...I tried ""just putting myself out there"". Since I recently started this nes job I was living in a completely new city, so I was hoping that maybe I could have a fresh start. Well...it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. 

So one of my co-workers (who has been working there for some time and has lived in Pittsburgh for a while so he has a good social life) said that he and his wife are having a party at his place and anyone from my company was invited to go. So, I decided to just give it a try and just ""come out of my shell"". I was even feeling some confidence in me. I dressed better than I usually do, and went. 

I was the only person from my company that went. Everyone else were either old friends of the co worker or friends of his wife from medical school. I tried making small talk but to absolutely no avail, and every failure made feel more shitty about myself. Nothing I said sounded interesting. None of my jokes are funny. Just like in my college days, my high school days, my middle school days, and even for the most part my elementary school days...I was a nobody when it came to socializing. I was that awkward kid in the corner. There were many ladies there, but i wasn't even trying to hit on any of them. I just wanted to try and make a friend maybe (guy or girl) but maybe I was asking too much for myself.

Also I had a hard time relating to all the stories. They were talking about how they had friends that did this or a girlfriend that does that or a date that went like this or a honeymoon that went like that. I mean I don't blame them. It's not like they I know I am basically a zygote when it comes to a social or romantic life. And if they knew, they would want to get away from me. 

Also physically I felt insignificant. I am 5'8 and pretty much everyone was taller than me (some of them were in great shape). Even the women were taller than me. So yeah, I'm a total manlet too (when will I ever learn hahaha). 

So yeah, in some ways a social setting made feel like even more of a loser than I do when alone (at least when I am alone I can distract myself from those thoughts with stuff I like). I tend to look forward to working, because my job is the one thing that gives my life meaning because it's in an industry I love (space robotics....not NASA but they give us funding) and it had for the most part ended my thoughts of ending it all...but unfortunately not entirely, because outside of work I have nothing to do that keeps me feeling purposeful. Noone outside my kin really cares about me, and in order to grow as a person I have to grow outside of my kin obviously. 

So yeah. Here I am, back in my shell wrapped in a blanket alone in my room. I don't know what to do about it. And I am deeply ashamed to say it, but it does tear me up the more I realize this about myself. I feel like my ship has sailed. I feel like I am destined for this.

Sorry for getting melodramatic. 

Tl;dr I tried socializing and it didn't work out and ended feeling lonelier."
2672,Not sure what to do anymore,"I lost my brother a year and four months ago. I lost my grandfather four months ago and my cousin two months ago. So basically it’s been a year filled with loss for me and it’s been so awful. I tried therapy with two different therapists and didn’t like either of them. I tried an in person support group and didn’t like it. My boyfriend  and some of my friends are a great support but I’m still so lost. I don’t confide in my parents bc they are going through a lot as well. All I want to do is sleep and eat, I’ve been calling out of work a lot and canceling plans. I’m on lexapro and smoke weed to try and help too but still I’m so sad. I try to work out but it’s hard to stay motivated. I just need to get better."
2673,How do you win life when you don’t actually want to be happy and have good things because you don’t feel deserving of them?,I sabotage anything good I have/could ever have because I hate myself so much I want to be miserable
2675,Stop telling me I need a hobby,"I have hobbies. Well, I had them. Things I loved, poured my heart and soul into. Now, my biggest achievement is waking up in the morning.

Everyone tells me I just need something to distract me, to ""pull myself out of the fog"". If only it were that easy.

I've had depression for over half of my life. I don't even know why I'm still here. It is yet another failure of mine that I am. 5 attempts and I still can't get it right.

I'm so tired."
2677,Left my job after wanting to climb the walls for over 6 months,"I need to discharge from this.

You know there are toxic relationships. But there are toxic jobs too!

I am technically gifted in Excel. Soon, the whole company wanted me to do their job. As a person that doesn't know how to say no, I became overwhelmed quickly.

The mere notification sound of an Outlook email was enough to trigger sweating, anxiety and stress.

I began having chills all day, allergies, insomnia, short breath, headaches, stomach and bowel problems, and more.

I began taking long walks out of the office through the rear exit into the parking lot and returning through the front door as an escape to overwhelming stress. The first time was liberating. Then I went to need 2 walks per day, then 3, 4 and so on.

Nothing was enough to relief the psychological pain of having to sit in that chair for 8 hours.

I was about to either kill myself or kill the next mother fucker that wanted me to take job that was assigned to them.

So I quit. Fuck you all and leave me in peace. Started my own Excel teaching company. Amazon hired me to give some courses! It was great. But Contracts have declined due to a bad local economy. 

I no longer want to kill myself. However, sequels remain. Now I am anxious because I need to make some cash. The mere thought of getting another ""traditional"" job haunts the shit out of me due to my last experience.

Hope you can give some advice. I have enough savings for many months, maybe over 3 years. But I am stressed to have long periods of $0 per day."
2678,I miss laughter.,I miss laughing so much. The genuine kind that starts to sound hideous which only makes you laugh even more. The silent laugh where you have to come up for air before you drown in endless bouts of laughter. Those are some of the best times and the warmest of feelings.
2679,I got into a wreck yesterday.,"Got T-boned in an intersection. Hit my driver side door hard enough to move my car against the sidewalk. I walked away shaken but I injured, and everybody says I’m lucky. I don’t really feel lucky though. To be honest I don’t even really care. Sucks for my car but It’s not like I suddenly have this appreciation for life I’m being told I should have. Part of me kind of just wishes that would have been it and to be honest I really don’t know why.."
2680,I seriously hate myself,I have no friends and i hate myself.... i wish i could have a different body.
2681,Have you heard of these mindfulness cards?,Have you heard of these mindfulness cards? https://www.lswmindcards.com
2682,What was your experience with long-term treatment placements?,"I'm interested in other people's experiences, I've lived at several max level institutions for mental kids and I feel like it totally fucked me up more and was overall a terrible experience. The goal of people who run the places I stayed wanted MONEY, not well taken care of kids. I stayed at milhous children services (which changed their name) and summitview. I stayed at several houses within these companies and it was like living in a mental hospital, you have no rights, choices, freedom, you don't have shit. You just have to endure the constant crisis clients are going through around you which ranged from schizophrenic episodes, autisitic kids breaking everything, self mutilation, constant verbal fighting. We were not seen as people. They have kids from 7-17 learning in the same classroom with the same curriculum and I had to recover a lot of credits when I finally got out because they didn't offer the correct classes. I mostly just drew pictures and read books."
2683,Nothing I do is right.,"I don't know what people want from me. I tell them what's going on and they get upset I'm so negative, I try to put a positive face on and people can tell and get annoyed I'm hiding things. If I spend time around people, even trying hard to pretend I'm fine I still drain them and they get upset, but if I isolate and stay away, they get upset about that too.

 What am I supposed to do? Every answer is wrong, except ""Don't be depressed"" but I can't just DO that. I can't just tap my fucking heels together and make it go away. I'm sorry I'm annoying and draining but how the hell do you think I feel?"
2684,I don’t “deserve” to be depressed. So I must just be lazy [cue SELF SHAME &amp; PITY].,"Every morning, I battle a vicious loop of depression and shame. From the outside I appear to lead a wonderful life (great career and family, superficial attributes). It exacerbates the cycle and exhausts me. I feel like I don’t deserve to be unhappy (I’m blessed with so much in this life) and then I just feel intense shame for being “lazy” and not making the most of time and this precious, delicate life. 

So, I stay in bed or on my sofa for long periods. I make believable excuses to show up late to my fabulous job. I make excuses to not show up to fun social activities. Friends stop texting over time. 

It’s not like I don’t know what makes me happy. But I also avoid doing those things. Why? I’m not really sure. The feeling is a bit like always wishing to move to NYC, then actually moving there, but staying in the warm comfort of my apartment and feeling FOMO and shame each day I hear the world buzzing outside my window. 

Does anyone understand this feeling? And how have you dealt with it? I feel tired. And like life is passing me by."
2685,Thought I'd achieve it all and be happy. Currently life reduced to ashes.,"TL;DR: Was previously really ambitious. Currently I have energy for absolutely nothing and feel like my life is done.

Currently 28. Got an engineering background and worked for around 3 years in the field. Also spent some time abroad working. During university I started taking Escitalopram 20mg for generalized anxiety and depression due to a breakdown. Considered taking a time off from university but Escitalopram ended up solving everything - anxiety vanished and I felt like a big weight was taken off of my shoulders. I kept pushing; was even more motivated to go on than before. I kept taking my pills for years and everything was pretty much fine - I didn't become the most social person in the world with Escitalopram but anxiety and depression were manageable. After around 5 years of taking it I started to slowly tapper it down, for around 1 year. I chose to go really slowly as I had tried to quit fast before and those were quite bad experiences. When I was already down to 2.5mg, a lot in my life changed - ended a 1-year relationship, moved back to my parents, and also started working as a freelancer remotely, so a lot of solitude involed. This was back in April. I was already at such a low dose of Escitalopram that I said fuck it, and also dropped the meds - saw it as a whole new start.

Was fine-ish for a month or 2. Then crippling anxiety and panic started to creep in. The type of panic I thought I would never get to experience - at times I just wanted to get out of my body. I started having suicidal ideations then. Also started having severe digestion problems. I was being followed by a psychologist who I had been with for around 2 years. During our sessions we agreed that this would just take some time to adjust and go back to normal, as my brain was getting used to function without the SSRI. The anxiety and panic didn't start dimishing though, they were only increasing. I got into a downward spiral. I also started worrying a lot about my digestion problems as I wasn't being able to digest anything properly and all my appetite disappeared - which further increased my anxiety and panic. This made me go to a lot of medical appointments and exams, from which nothing wrong was found in my digestive system. They just told me it was caused by anxiety. I accepted it after having a clean endoscopy and colonoscopy and made an appointment with a psychiatrist to treat the anxiety. I also stopped working because I just wasn't being able to function with the severe panic and repetitive thoughts about the digestive issues. 

Tried a course of several different SSRI's but nothing seems to work like it did back when I first started Escitalopram. I've tried Fluvoxamine, Mirtazapine, and currently I'm on Escitalopram again (around 3 weeks on 10mg and for 2 weeks on 20mg). While I was on Mirtazapine (and also on Bromazepam) I started feeling really tired and achy, like I had the flu and having headaches  (even though I was only on 7.5mg Mirtazapine). I went thorugh some bloodwork tests and they found that my liver enzimes were quite high and likely those meds were to blame (this was around 2/3 months ago). After I stopped them, my liver enzimes went back to normal, but the original syptoms I had didn't, which made my anxiety skyrocket again. Also started having muscle twitches all over my body and waking up feeling completely drained. Also some days I felt a burning sensation in my arms and legs. Started worrying about a potential neurological disease such as MS, and started having repetitive suicidal thoughts as I didn't want to go through such a terrible disease. My suicidal ideation grew so strong I had to ask my parents to check me in at the hospital, otherwise I would soon act on it. Spent 9 days at the hospital. Doctors tell me the symptoms I have are either psychosomatic or side effects of the medication, but this still isn't enough to quell my distress - I'm currently really, really depressed about the fact that I might have something, although the Escitalopram seems to have made the anxiety vanish. Even the thought of it being something non-life threatening such as fibromyalgia scares me to death as I don't want to live my life feeling like I am debilitated and, as I see it now, would rather die. Anyone went through similar symptoms and it turned out to be nothing?

Summarizing: I'm 28, living with my parents, no job or any interest to get one, no energy to do anything, no SO, and afraid to have a debilitating disease."
2686,Mental health support,"I decided to open a Fiverr to help people with handeling depression and anxiety. I want to genuinely get people back on their feet and be the friend they need.

I know this is self-promotion. The intent it to make people aware that there are affordable options to reach a helping hand and the affordable options are not always ""bots"".  

For that purpose, i won't be linking my page although you're more than welcome to reach out. 

I am used to reading rather than writing on reddit so please if i violate guidelines let me know."
2687,Did anyone else figure out that they were depressed through their own writing?,"So this was an oddly funny realisation for me. I read an article in which the writer was talking about how she used to write 'morbid poems' in middle school, before eventually getting diagnosed in her 20s. This made my jaw drop, because I did the same thing!! Since I was 14, all my diaries were filled with constant negativity like 'I'm so bad at everything, why do I suck so much', a shitload of anxiety, and a constant preoccupation with the fact that something was deeply wrong. Fast forward to college and I'm getting therapy for those exact same thoughts. Oh well,  now that I'm getting better, I can afford to cackle about it.

Did anyone else do this?"
2688,I,"I’m a disgusting, ugly, horrible person. I don’t deserve to be happy. I dont have anyone that cares about my situation or what I go through. I don’t deserve to be alive. I wish i would die. I wish i had the courage to kill my self. My life has been shitty all the way up until now and i STILL have to keep going. I pray to God some days that he will just end me. Take me off the face of the earth. I hate it here and i hate having to live in my own skin."
2689,Why,"Why did you start talking you him again? I know who he is now. You didn't lie to me about him, but you didn't tell me the full truth. We were so happy. So why did you feel the need to text your old fuck buddy again? And why did you get mad at me for being jealous about him? All you told me is that he was an old friend. Was I not enough? Did I ever matter to you in the first place? Why did you start hanging out with him again? Why did you pick him over me? Just.... why?"
2690,I’m a man and struggling with depression. Nobody gives an eff.,"All I want to do is sleep. I come home from work, don’t have the energy to do anything. Crawl into bed like 7pm. Shut post on reddit. Lie there until 6am. Wash repeat. 

It’s absolutely true that nobody wants men to be weak or vulnerable. People all about toxic masculinity and how men need to be open and vulnerable, but the moment you try, people are disgusted and turn away. 

I don’t know what to do. I live in this fog and don’t know how to get out. Nobody will help."
2691,Everything is wrong with today,"Had a fight this morning with my partner as I couldn’t get out of bed to go to gym. I tried to tell him how I’m feeling but he just went on a rant for half hour about how I’m being lazy and is ruining his lifestyle. 
I’m an accountant by profession, and got married earlier this year but haven’t been able to get a job in 5 months. 
Started working in a coffee shop three months and I’ve been messed up three or four times including today with the start times as they kept changing the schedules over the week. I’m still at fault and my supervisor just went on about how I have no focus and that I look tired.

I don’t even know where to begin fixing."
2692,How to hide cuts,So I’d never considering telling my parents anything because of the kind of relationship we have. But I would like to know the best way to hide cuts on the wrist?
2693,I'm either depressed or bored,"There's not much to life isn't it?

If you're a female, you will probably start feeling jaded after a certain age because most men just want sex, a maid or a therapist. 

If ur a guy ur probably jaded cause you're not getting laid because you're ugly or poor. I know a 40yo guy who is struggling to pay off his audi r8 he doesn't even drive because he didn't pay road tax. The extend men go to get laid make me laugh. The extent woman go to stay young is sad too.

Then there's college and work where you do the same thing all day everyday. Lucky if u get the weekend off. Lucky if you're passionate about something. Good luck being passionate about the same thing after a few years. 

Jealous of those who make a lot of money? They eat breathe poop work. I dated men who make 90k a year at 26 and do coke. They always do drugs because no time to date and work always sucks. Most get fat and unattractive and pay hookers. 

Looking for fullfilment in having kids. If you're lucky that might work out. So many can go wrong too.

You can travel your whole life like some people. I've met them too. They're lonely. They're insecure because people are climbing career ladder and they have nothing to show for in that department. You seen one beach you've seen it all. 

I know some happy people too. An old couple that work mundane job and travel once a year. That's about it. Most people are miserable. The young, the middle age with kids, the middle age with no kids, most of the working population basically...."
2694,What's beyond depression?,"I was wondering what lays beyond depression and anxiety?.
 Is there anything spiritual to achieve by going through such times ?  

I acknowledged that actually I subconsciously wanted to be alone and I wanted to go through dark times. And I got this by moving alone to another country for studying right after a painful, dramatic breakup and family problems. Probably I've been longing for introspection, which I have achieved pretty much. I'm thinking that the reason I longed for such times was the fact that I developed a social phobia, and I neglected and suppressed my feelings for too long and I needed time alone to recover somehow. I look at my situation as objectively as possible.

But one year has passed and I kinda got bored of that lonely, depressive and anxious mood.
The point of my  writing is that I tried a couple of times to get over that, to set some goals, to change my attitude, etc. But each time it lasts for a couple of weeks and than it hits me again and I don't know why is it coming back to me.

I'll point out that I don't have a job and I don't have a constant real life contact with other people.

So, how can I get out of this ? 
Will getting a job and having constant contact with people help me out ? 

Each time it comes back I assume that I just didn't understand the reason I'm in such a mood and that there is something more than a simple state of mental exhaustion.

Each time it gets better for a while I feel like I am loosing the touch with myself and I have to get back to my cave. 
The feelings of happiness feel like something intrusive.

I have developed some psychoanalytical skills while being in such moods and reading philosophy, psychology but I feel like something is missing anyways, something I don't understand, and that thing that I don't understand is the key of my cave.

I don't know if I should go on reading some hardcore philosophy like Jung, or as simple as bible in search for more answers
 OR
 if I should adopt some superficial positive emotions in order to try a few more times to fake getting out of cave until I'm actually out ?"
2696,feelings on teen mental health stigma,"i’m a teenager (not revealing exact age) who has experience with anxiety and depression since a young age. and i absolutely hate it when people (presumably other teens) make these ‘edgy’ or ‘cool’ statements about mental health. no it’s not ‘cute’ to deal with a real life monster, and if that’s how you view it, then you obviously don’t have it. you obviously don’t understand what it’s like. people who just throw around the mental health issues like they’re normal feelings have no clue what how nasty it really is. sadness is more common than depression and fear is more common than anxiety. and both fear and sadness are common feelings. GET. THAT. STRAIGHT. if you’re going to use false mental health problems for attention, you’re damaging the ones who actually deal with these morbid conditions by making fun of their condition in a way. you’re just making it worse.

also, people who say that these feelings are ‘just part of growing up’, are sometimes right, but should probably refrain from the statement for the sake of the ones actually diagnosed.

update-i was diagnosed with both anxiety and depression recently, which makes my feelings even stronger."
2697,Fuck depression,That’s all I wanted to say.
2698,Uninteresting fact: I wore the same clothes everyday for the whole semester,Just realised that I wore the same t shirt and jeans for 3 months straight! Didnt cut my hair in that long too lol
2699,Scary thoughts,"Sometimes im pretty happy i dont have a gun in my room or something else super lethal like poison or something, because sometimes i legit feel so fucking depressed, that i get afraid of myself and my irrational thoughts when in deep sadness that i think i could make a very bad decision"
2700,Self pain thoughts,"I want to smash my fingers and palm with a fucking hammer 

I want to slam a crowbar into my chest 

I want to hold a pencil still and slam my head/eye into it 

I want to cut open my skin and glue it to my eyes so i can just see the mess that is myself

I want to cut through my fingernails with a knife 

I want to tie a plastic bag to my own head and be tied to a heavy block and to be dumped in the ocean 

I want to be normal and sane 

I want to be loved like i once was 

I want to be free and not tied down by my own doubts and freakish threats 

I want to be the reason someone wakes up smiling 

I want to be someone's somebody."
2701,Suicide,Today is it. I’m done. I’m sick of feeling like this. It never goes away. It always comes back. I can’t tell my friends. This is me saying goodbye. I want to not. I do. But I can’t this time.
2702,Social isolation pushing me to the edge,"I can't even spend my time by watching television or a show without longing for that social interaction anymore. I think I've hit a new low.

(I'm diagnosed with depression, ocd, among other things. I am afraid to go outside due to my OCD, I only see and talk to mental health professionals either at home or one of my parents has to take me. I haven't had any other contact for months, close to a year. I'm trying to hold it together, but I just don't know anymore.)"
2703,"Melatonin, 5-HTP, L-Thyrosin, St John's wort, B6, B1 did it help you?","Hello everyone, I've been lurking for a while. I have serious depression and it's about time to change something. I know medicine isn't magic but I think the biochemical processes are just as important as psychological treatment. Therapie is probably a good idea and I'm talking about it but for now I'm looking for antidepressants to help me short term which are easily available to me, I'm really not feeling well. I spent hours over hours searching for information on these but every source seem to be saying different things. I'm so desperate to feel better, want to take them all at once but that is probably not a good idea. B6/B1 seem to be a factor for resorption.    

I'm curous for your experience. What combination in what dosis have you taken and which helped you?"
2704,I need some quick tips .,how do you forget about a person? I've tried doing good things for myself and i've tried sleeping in all day i now work at a clinic but i just get flashbacks to my ex and crazy aunty i lived with and i just don't know what to do anymore i wanna move on but for some reason i'm stuck in the past and i cant pass this real life fucking boss battle for me.  Please someone post some tips or ways to forget easily
2705,First poor attempt at over dosing last night,"This may be long and rambling but here goes anyway. I am a SAHM after a 20+ year career I just recently left to raise my small kids. My husband and my kids are my life. I feel like I do everything for them and little to none for myself. One condition of leaving my job was I was going to be solely responsible for the kids. Getting them to school, picking up, snack, dinner, bedtime, the whole nine yards and the second condition was I was to effectively run the house with cleaning , laundry and such. I feel like this is the role I was born for and I love it.  I also feel I do a good job with the exception of a sink full of dishes now and then and  a messy living room while the kids are playing. So yesterday my husband and I got in a fight and he told me he and my kids deserve better than me. That sentence crushed me. I suffer from depression and he knows it. I also suffer from suicidal thought and he knows that as well.  Last night I took 27 Xanax (that’s all I had) hoping I didn’t wake up in the morning. Obviously it didn’t work. I am so depressed right now and hurt and just don’t even want to live anymore. I know this is not normal. I have talked to drs about my depression before and I’m on Lexapro but him telling me they deserve better just keeps running through my mind. How do I pull myself out of this?  This is the first time I have ever acted in my suicidal thoughts."
2706,Going out of my comfort zone,"I finally went out of my comfort zone yesterday, though I am not sure how to feel about that yet.. Usually I do spent a lot of time outside, but only at nighttime and by myself. Yesterday I went into the city and decided I would try to speak to girls. It was really hard and I didn't have the courage to speak because most of the girls were with their friends. I roamed around the city for 2-3 hours trying to just do it.. But it was hard because the girls I saw walking around by themselves walked past me very fast, and I didn't want to be like a creep and go back to catch up. 
At the end of the day I was at the bus station and saw a girl, not that I was attracted to her or whatever but I know myself, and I would be pissed if I went home having talked to no one. I walked past her to see when my bus was coming and afterwards stopped thinking and was like man fuck it. I went over and said something along the lines of "" Hey I just saw you and knowing myself, I'd regret not coming to talk to you and introduce myself. My name is.., and what is yours?"" We shaked hands and exchanged names, but her responses were dry, she never asked me something and I had to tell her by myself we are from the same country etc. But she had a little smile (maybe because she was laughing at me) and she didn't seem nervous or threatened or whatever, just not interested.. I am mad at myself because it got weird when I asked her her age, she was 25 and I am just 20. Obviously the age gap made me reconsider and we simply stopped talking and I turned around acting like someone called me because I was embarrased. I walked to the next bus station and she literally was in the same bus, so embarrissing!! She laughed at her phone when she saw me getting in, like when she texted her friends about it because it was so funny to her or whatever. I never seen this girl before and we got off the same stop, I fear we know similar people and she tells many this story or maybe even took a picture of me when I turned around and people will recognize me or whatever. Thats me overthinking. 
Looking back, I should've just closed the conversation like ""Alright. Well I gotta go, have a good one"" but I simply stopped talking like the awkward stupid man I am. Also, I should've been more confident but it is so hard for me to be with my depression, she probably realized I had no confidence. We only talked for a minute and my mind is like ""See? U coulnd't even get her to like you. You are from the same city and she will tell everyone about it, she even laughed at you while typing to others about that encounter""
But at least I went out my comfort zone, whatever the consequences may be I don't regret going against my self hating brain. It was my first time talking to a girl which I saw for the first time, with girls I know I am very relaxed and more confident, but in that situation I was more kind of nervous. Maybe I'll do it again.. maybe I won't. 

Thanks for reading, these kind of things are always in my mind and I just wanted to get my story out there because I have no one else to talk to. Maybe I am just looking for someone saying I did good trying.."
2707,"I have an infection but I wont go to the hospital, I think I want it to kill me...","I have been suffering from an infection for close to 5 days now, I'm sure it would be relatively easy to clear up but I can't make myself go get it looked after, it's like the voice in my head that been telling me for years to kill myself is now telling me to ignore it. I can die without doing it myself..

These thoughts are scaring me, I don't want to do it this way I can't imagine how much it'll cause me to suffer but I can't force myself to go to the hospital either. I'm having a war in my head right now and just needed to get this out of my head and onto something I can read. I don't know why I'm doing this, I'm just scared at how little value I have for my own life."
2708,Realized I'm going to die alone. (Suicide. 3-4 years? Tops.),"Just read a meme that said ""There are 7 thousand people on Earth and your still single. Obviously that isn't true as there are 7.7 billion people. For the sake of argument there are 3.85 billion men and 3.85 billion women. It just got me thinking out of 3,849,999,999 women I'm still fucking single. Of course not all of them are in the same country and such but still. I live in the U.S and there are 329 million people. Suppose 164.5 million are women. Out of fucking 164,500,000 women, I'm still fucking single. Idk just a depressed rant I suppose. I'm just SO FUCKING DONE with life. Everyday... The thought of racking my Glock, swallowing the fucking barrel, and pulling the trigger sounds like a fucking ball. I don't fucking know anymore. Talking to friends, family, therapist, strangers on Reddit....DOESNT FUCKING HELP. AT FUCKING ALL. I really don't give a fuck about anything about anymore. My health, my life, it's all fucking meaningless. I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE!"
2709,I just found out this morning that my dad is sick in the hospital,"I'm not looking for judgments or pity. I just need to vent.

My parents let me stay with them at my grandma's. I have mental health issues that have prevented me from getting into the work force.

I'm 27 now. That made me realize that I'm not going to be able to stay here forever. I was fooling myself that maybe he had 10 more years in him. I thought that maybe I could make something happen career-wise before that time. That maybe I could be a success, which I still believe I will be at some point, before long.

But I was selfish and expected too much, even if I felt like I had special needs. I'm certainly a lot less than perfect. As hard as things are for me with my mental health, now I just have an impulse to get a job regardless of how my mind would be affected.

You probably think ill of me and I don't blame you if you're reading this. I don't know what I'm going to do. I just hope that things get better."
2710,"Anyone else feel like they'll never be loved, nor do they deserve it?","I've been alone my whole life, obviously something is wrong with me and i deserve to be alone.

I've never even  hugged anyone before"
2711,i am heartbroken,"i am 20 years old. for a very long time i have suffered from having no self esteem, constantly feeling guilty, being introverted and being very anxious about the future

a week ago, my boyfriend and i broke up because he needed some space (we were spending every day together and this was becoming unhelpful and unhealthy for our relationship even though we were totally the same and we got along really well) to make some friends.

he still loves me, but he needs some time off of a relationship because he is also mentally unstable and his personal problems led him to be not ready anymore to maintain a relationship 


he was my best friend and i imagined a future with him. i feel like i have nothing else that’s motivates me. i feel desperate and i know i will look for him in everyone i meet, i mean everyone says that it will get better, and it’s only been a week but i am going to miss him so much and i feel depressed and there’s nothing i can imagine doing to feel less anxious, i haven’t got the energy to find a hobbie nor to talk to new people because i miss him so much and at the end of the day, there is nothing that makes me happy, i haven’t got any friends either, or maybe 1.
i am in a vicious circle and i fucking hate life"
2712,Weird occurrence,"So I’m in the local market having some dark depressing thoughts, and as my mind is racing a stranger and I have to walk around each other, he says how are you and I put on a smile and say I’m great how about you even though I’m not great far from it, afterwards it really made me think how most people put on a act to seem happy or fine in everyday situations all the time"
2713,Nothing is interesting anymore,Things I used to like and new things I try it all feels very flat. I'm so bored and left alone with terrible thoughts.
2714,I feel like I don’t deserve to be depressed,"There are so many people that have it worse than me. People who live in poverty, people with abusive relationships, people who struggle to stay alive. My life is perfect compared to others. Why should I be depressed?"
2715,It hurts when no one gives a shit about what you have to say.,"I'm a really lonely person in real life, and next year I'm taking some classes that will hopefully help that because they're about things I'm interested in so I might be able to meet some people who have shared interests. In the meantime, I've joined some Discord servers about some things I'm interested in. Every time I post, no one responds. It's like I'm not even there. People just carry on their conversations without me. The saddest part is that it's like that in real life too with everyone I know now. My family has no interest in what I have to say so I just stay quiet."
2716,Does anyone else hate light?,"I feel like a vampire, I just hate when someone turns the light on when I’m in a room by myself.

I kinda feel exposed, I don’t want anyone to see me, and in general it’s too bright and annoying.
 
Can anyone relate?"
2717,I feel so goddamn broken,"Every aspect of my life, school, work and family is going to shit.

Let’s start with school, my grades are going downhill and my teachers hate me and are threatening to kick me out of school.

My managers are always giving me a hard time and every time I’m at work I’m stressed out.

My parents hate me and my sisters don’t speak to me.

I know I made mistakes in the past, but all I want is an opportunity to change but every time things start to improve, it gets worser then last tune.

I feel trapped in my own negative thoughts and I feel there is no way out.

Thanks for reading"
2718,lonely kinda,"i really want older friends in my area but most of them are uptight rich pricks or lowlife threatening druggies. i have friends but i want friends that know nothing about me yet understand me. even if i have to get the train to spend time with friends. i hate everyone my age (13) they act all hard but in reality they’re pussies. i wanna be around 15-17yr olds, i feel more comfortable around that crowd. but i know they wouldn’t feel comfortable around me because i’m “so young”"
2719,What do I do next?,"I need some guidance here... I'm 35 and have never had any success in any profession, I thought this last one I would be able to start slow and at least be working but I have been unemployed now for 6 months. I have been on lots of meds but nothing seems to be working. I have zero passion for anything, I hate all my hobbies. Weed use to help but has recently been doing more harm than good so I have stopped using it completely. The only change I see day to day is everything getting worse. I've taken CBT classes which helps on the surface but doesn't take care of the real problems. My health is crumbling, I'm also type 1 diabetic.  


what do I do next? whats my next step? I am very open to what your ideas may be."
2720,I just failed out of college,"This past semester was the worst yet. I got on to an antidepressant, my anxiety and depression was the worst it’s ever been. But fuck, I was so close to pulling through. I just didn’t focus enough. I don’t know where to go from here or what to do. Suddenly any hope I had of getting my shit together feels lost. Think I’m just going to go on a long drive to think about it"
2721,Depressed boyfriend advice,"Hey guys. My (23F) boyfriend (27) has been struggling with depression the past few years. This year has been especially bad. He hasn’t had a job and had to drop out of college. I struggle with my mental health as well (cptsd, GAD, social anxiety, depression, panic disorder). But I’m still working and going to school. I’ve been helping him financially all year and it’s wearing me out! I don’t have the savings account balance I should have because what I would save is now going towards him and helping him get his businesses off the ground. 

Lately it’s been bugging me that I can’t get his attention (LDR). He’ll disappear for a week and won’t give me a heads up. Then when I ask to talk he says we can yet he replies hours later or not at all. I’m getting frustrated because I should be able to lean on him as well but I can’t because he’s always doing stuff (working on his businesses, helping family, in his depression cave). What do I do?"
2722,Today I’m pretty sure I broke my hand due to horrible thoughts leading up to me leaving my boyfriend which ended up in complete rage. So just venting here. Should go to the ER soon but not feeling it right now...,
2723,Help,I feel like I have depression but I haven’t been diagnosed as I have not told anyone and I can’t bring myself to do it. I have also been cutting up my arm with relatively deep cuts (would be deeper if I had something better) and have been thinking about suicide on and off and I don’t know what to do. Please help
2724,Problem with a co-worker,"I'm having an issue with a supervisor at work and lately it's making me more depressed/anxious. He feels the need to put me down in front of others. I try to blow it off and not let it bother me but lately it's getting to me. Especially since I'm stressed at home because my boyfriend has started chemo. For example the other day we were discussing a word game we played at lunch and he made it a point to say ""you know, the one Erica had a problem with"".  I will say one of my coworkers turned around and said ""I had a problem with that one also"". Joking around a few times is one thing but this is happening more and more. I've been biting my tongue for fear that something nasty is going to come out, which could make matters worse. The other issue is he might be my supervisor in the near future. My fears are is going to get worse, I'm going to say something really nasty or others will see him doing it and think it's ok to start doing it. Suggestions on how to handle this?"
2725,I feel like a loser and I just needed to get this out,"I feel like a loser and I just needed to let it out

Recently I’ve moved to a foreign country for academic reasons. 

I’ve worked myself up for this for the last 7 years. Pure constant and self-destructive drive just so that I could get out of my home country into a better one. Of course overall it is a step up but I just feel fucked up inside.

Being that focused on my studies and everything else related to me getting out has left me fucking empty in so many areas. My social skills are nothing but shit, I’ve never had a girlfriend before since it would intervene with my goal and it is LITERALLY impossible for me by now to make a real human connection. I am completely incapable of it. This is also due to major past events that have given me a completely dark idea on what life is.

Overall I’m pretty presentable. I’ve been a very serious gym goer for the last 4 years as it was the best outlet for any frustration and because of that I seem very approachable by people. The thing is that as soon as I see that they want to make a serious connection I step back as if I’m about to get fucking burned and scorched. It’s getting really frustrating and I can’t handle it anymore. I have almost zero knowledge in social cues and that just adds it all up. Unless I’m directly told, I simply cannot tell if a girl likes me or not and no matter the answer I cannot ask her just because of the anxiety of what happens after.

The loneliness is fucking killing me. Literally killing me. Today I woke up after a long shift at work bawling my eyes out from the physical pain of loneliness. It was as if my stomach was being ripped apart. I just could not handle it anymore. The most blissful and peaceful moment I’ve had in fucking months was a sad meal by myself at McDonalds. I just feel like I’ve lost a huge fucking portion of my life, all my teenage years and everything else with it and now at the age that I am (20 y/o) I feel like I’ll never be able to fully immerse myself in anything else besides work. 

I FEEL LIKE A FUCK UP and I just need someone that I can trust that it’s going to be okay."
2727,Update from last post: Only getting more encouragement to kill myself,"It’s only getting worse, I got a C in one of my school grades and a B+ in another, the rest are A’s but my parents expect me to get nothing below an A-, I haven’t shown them yet, I am simply lost for what to do. My friends are only getting more toxic and annoying. Some stuff I forgot to include in my last post: my parents are just so unfair, they made me go to taekwondo when my back hurted, my hands really hurted, and when my legs barely functioned, but when my mom had a few coughs she was like “SoRrY bUt I’m ToO sIcK tO gO”, they also insult my interest in gaming and my friends, saying that all we are interested in is gaming and sitting on our fat butts all day, which is entirely not true, my mom is also very rude and selfish, she always insults other people who are fat and/or don’t work out, she also gets mad at other people when they do something that was ‘selfish of them’ even though she always does something when it’s comfortable for her. But again what makes it super bad is that they are nice and loving SOMETIMES, which makes me not want to kill myself but it’s still increasing the chances of me doing so. And thanks to the other two redditors who supported me in my last post."
2729,It's been a long time coming,"Life feels like it has just been going on for so long now. I'm not suicidal or anything, I'm just tired. You know the feeling when everything in your life is going exactly how someone might hope their life would go but you just feel empty? 

I mean, I'm in school for one of the most competitive work fields, only 5% of applicants got in (with over 2000 applicants). When I got my letter I didn't feel excited or happy like most people would. And now I just work so hard at it to be mediocre 

I spend a lot of time in the closet now, literally. When I was a kid and my parents would fight, I would hide in my small closet. It gave me comfort, now I spend any time I'm not studying sitting in the closet, just waiting.

I've been fighting off my alcoholism for a while now. I drank about 6 days a week for the last 4 years, drinking myself to sleep every night. I've been sober for about 3 weeks, but all I want to do is drink and sleep. I drink for that purpose to sleep, without it I can't sleep well. 

I used to like things, but right now if you gave me all the money in the world, I couldn't tell you what I would do, where I would go, who I would take with me. I don't want anything but to rest. I'm surrounded by people all day, they're all wonderful, but I feel so alone when I'm with them. I see them and see how happy they look, I put on the same face but under it I'm different, they could be different too. 

It's just tiring to pretend all the time, it's tiring to be lonely all the time, it tiring to be trying all the time, it's tiring to live all the time. That's why I love alcohol, it puts me to bed and then I'm not tired, at least for a while."
2730,I feel so alone. [21M],"I've never gotten to really grow up, to have my coming of age. I was homeschooled my whole life. I live in a remote area and was incredibly sheltered. I wasn't taught how to drive because it was too dangerous. So I didn't really get to go anywhere on my own. I'm moving to college next month, but I feel so alone.

I didn't get to make my own decisions, to find out who I was. I haven't made mistakes that I regret. Nor have I done anything I'm proud of. And doing all that, making difficult decisions and being stressed, that's how you grow up. How you find out who you are and learn how to live in the real world.

And sure, I'm still young, It's not too late for me to learn these things about myself. But I don't want to do it alone. I don't even know if I can.  When you are in high school. Everyone else is going through the same things. The same journey of self-discovery and coming of age. I didn't get that.

I want to be someone's first kiss, first boyfriend, first anything. I want friends to cheer me on and get excited for me when I finally pass the driver's test. I want to have someone to talk to about what I'm going through, and they can understand it because they just went through the exact same thing. Or to ask me for advice, because I've gone through it before they did.

I'm so far behind everyone else, and it feels so isolating."
2731,"I'm broken, I can't win, I only lose now.","Everything in my life is going ok, I have a girlfriend who means everything to me and it's going really well. I'm doing a course at university that I love and I have a job that I don't mind. Regardless of all of this, every Sunday, before the week starts, I feel awful, work terrifies me, I go and it's really not that bad but there's fear linked to everything I do. It's constant. Thoughts such as dying on my way and never seeing anyone again, I worry about getting trapped there, I worry about collapsing. All sorts. It's relentless, I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll feel so sad it's almost like I'm dead, I'll wake up in the night filled with dread and fear, thoughts that I'll go to hell, thoughts that I'll lose everything. I try to push through, I used to see finishing work and going everyday as winning but the days of this pain turned to weeks and weeks to months and I've realised there is no winning, I'm only losing, it's ruining my life and I don't know how to feel normal, I'm not sure if I've ever felt normal. My girlfriend is away now for a few weeks as she's finished uni and seeing her really helped me to get through these hard day's as I knew even at its worse I could go and see her and just have some time where I don't worry about anything, where I can just feel happy and safe. She's only a couple of hours away, so I can go and see her but with work and things we're both busy and she's only just gone back and I don't want to seem too clingy, especially since she'll be catching up with her friends and family. I want to give her some space. So, I'm on my own and I don't know how I'm going to get through this and I don't think there's anything anyone can do to help me, I just needed to write this because its crippling. Honestly, clueless. The fear genuinely takes my breath away, it's sharp and quick and it's very scary. With this stress i'm sure I'm going to die of a heart attack, my body is exhausted, mentally I'm exhausted. It makes me so angry, I have everything but I still feel like complete shit, constantly, what do I need to feel normal? When it's good, it's great, when it's bad, it's so awful and right now, I seem to be feeling awful a lot more than great. Fucking fed up with this shit"
2732,Relapsed today,I was clean from self-harm for almost a year but things took a turn for the worst today and I couldn't think straight. Just did it and I felt free again.... I hate this. I just want to be ok.
2733,I cant sleep.,I cant sleep. I cant eat properly. I cry to bed almost every night. And i have no interest in my hobbies anymore. I get angry at my family easily. I'm just hoping to go to sleep without crying anymore. Im so tired...
2734,Are erased memories normal?,"I always wondered if it's a typical effect of depression to erase (childhood)memories. I myself don't even know how long I have actually been depressed. I'm diagnosed since I was 15/16(I'm 26 now) but I literally barly remember anything from before. 
All that is left are traumatizing experiences like being bullied, how that one time in Kindergarten I accidently killed a bee and my teacher forced me to apologize and bury it. Or that one time my cousin promised me a pair of sunglasses when his friend could lay naked on top of me while I just wore my underwear when I was like 6 or 7.(I paniced before he could lay fully on top and run away but still). 

I just barly remember my childhood. The happy parts of it. Anything. I always get suspicious when people tell me things of their childhood while I remember like nothing. I don't expect me to actually have full memory with all small details but... anything? That doesn't make me feel uncomfortable and anxious? 
I just want to remember my mother, not just her dead body. Or dog. My grandparents. I feel empty like something isn't right.

Is that something normal in general or a effect of depression? And before anyone says something about me being old: I already had erased memory before my depression being diagnosed."
2735,Does anyone else find making friends/dating a selfish thing to do?,"My therapist always tells me I should try and socialize more, that in my case it would help a little, but I find it selfish like why would I want to drag more people into my shit"
2736,No good enough,So my mom hid all of our knives and all I found was a tiny close pin and it's not good enough to draw blood ☹️
2737,"Thank you for listening kind stranger,","Hello random internet stranger, I hope your day was good. I just wanted to talk about the stuff that's been on my mind lately. I can't seem to STAY happy, I can be happy for some time if something good happens but I can't stay happy, I feel empty inside... Every night I sit in my room thinking, passing time. I have no one that I can talk to about this, I don't want my friends to think that I'm just an un-thankful piece of shit that has too many problems, I feel they wont care and don't want to trouble them. I suffer from anxiety, and most probably depression. I try to make my self happy, by making others happy, but then I feel paranoid that they don't care about me and I care too much. I honestly don't know what to do or where I'm gonna end up, but at least I'm not dead yet."
2738,Lazy Sunday,"Not feeling too bad today, still recovering from surgery so I’m spending the day on the couch watching Christmas movies with my daughter. I have a whole week off and not sure what I’m going to spend it doing but I think it will be okay.  A least I can enjoy today and be happy."
2739,Typing this before I get high and forgot about my problems for sometime or I get high and a bad thought ruins my high either way,Anyways am I the only one who is completely fine till out of no where boom a bad thought comes through and it’s one after the next no stop no matter what I’m doing in my day all it takes is one bad thought for it to constantly keep going next thing u know I can’t stop thinking about how I hate my self or I wish I could die or y god ain’t bless me I hate this but it’s just how I am. It takes so little for me to get annoyed and then boom my whole mindset is fucked
2741,I tried to kill myself last night,"I wanted to hang myself. I tried 3 times. The first time, the knot wasn't good enough. The second time I felt guilty so I stopped and the third time I got scared. I read somewhere that at some moment you'll get spasms. My mom has epilepsy so I'm frightened of getting those spasms myself.

If I could just make knots properly and wasn't a pussy I would be dead.

I called my boyfriend after all of it."
2742,I will delete This after 24 hours,"I'm from Iraq I'm 23 years old... i open my eyes to 2003 war we got destroyed because of the mf saddam the tyranny i haven't lived my childhood like other kids in the world, then from 2005 to 2008 civil war and killing in the street then 2014 isis came to iraq we won 4 years later after we lost city's and alot of people and now we are protesting against our criminal and corporated government and they killed 600 people and 20,000 people wounded till now in two months,i live in fear. they want to steal money and millions of people unemployed.. me myself i have been graduated for nearly 2 years and i haven't found any job .. we lack for basic services..... and i can't migrate to other countries because all the the courtiers close there borders ... it's literally like hell for me now I'm hopeless i don't have future ... i want to live in peace at least for one year ..... it's literally like I'm in prison .. and I'm too coward to end my life because i want to life like others but ... not happening."

2745,Stuck in a hole,Every so often I get stuck in a rut where I feel down and I can’t help myself. What should I do to be happier?
2747,Is it socially okay to stay at home for Christmas because of bad feelings instead of having to deal with the exhausting family?,
2748,Real world obligations are shit,"I'm supposed to fucking clean and give someone a ride. I don't care about them and I don't care if the shit gets clean. But you just have to keep playing life's little fucking game so you don't starve to death or end up outside in the cold with nowhere to go. Fuck working, fuck suffering, just give me a gun so I can do myself in already. Until then, I just want to get high and forget I or anyone else exists."
2749,Why can’t I just learn to close my mouth,"All my friends are wanting to cause drama it shouldn’t be because I’m horrible socially they need to learn to respect my boundaries. 
This is why I don’t need friends."
2751,don't know why i'm still alive,"like it's hard, everyday i feel like I'm the worst person alive, literally the w o r s t. Why I can't off myself, why I have to still be alive"
2752,"I'll never be the best, so what is the fucking point in doing anything?","Life is just a competition to get to the top. I realistically can't get to the top, and even if I could I would still be sad, or even sadder, because right now when I do get to the top, it only makes me feel even more pressured to maintain that status, which just leads to sadness depression and me wanting to die."
2753,I just can't put on the rose-tinted glasses,"Other people read new things and feel inspired. I feel nothing. I can't give anything in my life meaning or purpose. Actually, the truth is I don't want to give my life meaning or purpose. No, I don't want to necessarily have to deal with the consequences of that, but I will. Life is shit all around, and it's shit because of me, but I refuse to give anything in my life weight or meaning. I'm too weak for that. I don't want to make it so that I feel happy to get out of bed, I don't WANT to set course for some goal in my life, I don't WANT passion or love.

 I feel trapped living in this cruel world. I wish I didn't have to experience existence at all. I don't want to learn to love to live. I hate living, and part of hating being alive comes from the fact that I now also have to deal with death.

Fuck my lizard brain. I don't want a survival instinct. I want death to feel comfortable and welcoming and assuring. Life is just too shitty. I can't turn this fucking ship around and the fact is I just don't want to. I'm not willing to change. I'm not willing to be happy. I don't want to feel anything towards anything in life. I don't want to care about anything. Honestly if I can't get my life together while also being able to get high whenever I please then I just don't see the point. I know that's impossible so what is there to be happy about? I'm not going to live to serve or help someone else.  I just want to get high and stay high. 

I just don't want to change. I don't see the point in learning to love and to actively show others love again. I don't want to. I just don't feel comfortable with it. The best thing would be if every person on the planet disappeared, and I could enjoy the fruits of their labor in solitude until the very end. 

Maybe things could have been different. It doesn't matter now. I'm never going to feel okay. I don't know why I post here. It's not like I want to talk to any of you. I don't even consider you guys on this forum real people, but it's like I know you're real so I can both shout into the void while also dumping all of my shit on people who might consider it and see that things really are hopeless for some. Life is cruel and happiness is a lie we tell ourselves so we can feel okay. I can't play that game anymore."
2754,no emotional connection to anyone,"i’ve felt like this for years. i have friends, but i don’t think they’re really good people but they’re my only friends and i can’t find opportunities for new ones. i feel like i’m a burden and a bad person because of small stupid things i do. i wish people didn’t look at me the way they do. i don’t think i’m seen as a friend, just, i want to feel valued and validated by someone. my life’s been going drastically downhill the past year, got into drugs, slipping in school. i have too much responsibility and little support and it’s too much, i’m desperate at this point."
2755,I feel like I'm going crazy. I don't want to be alive anymore. I would never kill myself but I just wish I could.,"I'm depressed and it's only been getting worse and worse for 2.5 years. I don't recognize who I am anymore, and I don't think I'll ever get back who I used to be. I was so happy and so nice. I think that's why I'm taking this so hard. I was such a sweet optimistic person and now I just don't want to deal with my feelings anymore. They're overwhelming. When I feel good, I feel good. I laugh, smile, and enjoy myself. I *almost* feel normal again. I used to feel normal during the good times, but now I feel a little less happy/like myself when things aren't bad. When I start to feel bad I want to die and I get so sad it hurts. I don't even have the energy to make my life better. I won't let my boyfriend break up with me, even though the relationship has only been getting worse and worse. He cheated, he's so mean sometimes, and I've put so much love and care into him and this relationship. I tried so hard when he opened up about his depression. I adopted a realistic mindset that he's changed and I can't change him back, I tried to make things easier for him, I tried to show him I was here so he wouldn't worry about being left alone. Now that my depression has gotten worse, he has problems even hugging me when I'm crying/sad. He has called it annoying and insinuated that I'm the one making myself this sad. But why would I want to feel so bad that I'd want to be dead? I miss how things were before. I miss the old me. I cry for her constantly. Looking at old pictures of me genuinely smiling makes me tear up because I miss that. I'm starting to think I am doing this to myself though. Sometimes it feels like I like to be sad because I have so many opportunities to change this. I have friends I don't talk to anymore, I have people who want to hang out, I have access to therapy, I could set up an appointment for antidepressants, I could leave him (he has asked me to several times), I have family, my life is good. Why am I doing this to myself? Every time I do something that's good for me I feel better. So why am I laying in a bed for hours and starting arguments with my partner? Is he really being mean, or am I being irrational? Am I really depressed or am I making things bad for myself? I feel crazy. I can't tell what I'm warping with my perception anymore.

If you guys knew me personally before all of this, you would've been shocked. The personality change is so dramatic that it's actually sad. I was genuinely such a sweet, grateful, kind-hearted person. I used to think about how I wouldn't mind dying because my life had genuinely been so rewarding and fortunate. It felt like a gift that I was lucky enough to experience. Now I'm so overwhelmed I'm tired of it.

Can anyone relate? Should I ask someone I care to start forcing me to do these things bc I just cant?"
2756,I don't know.," 

I don't know what this feeling is.

Is it regret?

Is it doubt?

Sadness?

Care?

An infinite pool of thoughts, ideas and feelings?

Or is it the contrary, nothing?

I feel like I can look past it but at the same time it's always on my mind.

Maybe I'm just going insane over the topic in its confined context.

Do i want or care about the concept of intractable individuals?

Is family important?

What value do people even provide one another?

Intangible entities, emotions.

What a far-fetched yet close to heart concept.

I put up the facade of having them.

Or am I just thinking like this as a mechanism to cope, to exist?

Or am i this deluded?

Do I choose to do what I want, or do i do what others need?

Do I want anything?

Anything being something isolated to me, a goal, a want, an illusionary need.

Or am i merely an extension and tool for others desires living behind the facade of mutual need?

I'm not sure.

The consequence of wanting for me has become the lack of others needs.

Is that something I'm willing to take on mentally?

To conquer the wants of everyone I care about?

Is it what my want should be?

I can't justify why not but I feel hesitant, reluctant, and moreover wrong.

Is it right to block others paths in happiness for my own?

Is it possible to share happiness and it's multitude of paths with everyone?

Or is reality as grim as I feel now with sorrow and negativity consuming as fast as it's being consumed?

Why is it only significant events that trigger this thought process?

Why is it only love that can trigger such deep thought within me?

Why is it conflict that can cause so much confusion within me?

Why can I even perceive and comprehend what I cannot reason and justify?

I try to answer this everyday with the intent of solving it somehow.

Yet it seems like I get no further as time progresses.

I'm slowly losing the things I've thought were meant to be easily perpetual.

My relationships with individuals, my sense of self, my rationality.

But I don't fear losing them, in the moment at least.

Maybe I'm not aware I'm losing them.

Maybe I'm not losing them at all.

I don't mind changing if it's for a greater cause.

But what do i even define as great?

The duality of human nature is beyond my capabilities in a lifetime.

Maybe my ignorance for it stems from that.

Maybe i choose to fit in with norms to ignore the truth of reality.

Who knows.

Just some food for thought.

I don't expect these questions to be answered but write them to extend my thoughts onto paper.

Fear not, I'm not suicidal or anything near but merely confused with my own purpose and existence."
2757,i can't even trust myself anymore,"it used to be that i could trust myself and have faith in my decisions i make. but now it just feels like someone threw a reverse card on me &amp; i'm confused af. i really cannot know if it's just as it seems or it is my depression talking. 

i really noticed a change in behaviour of a friend whom i've been close with for a couple of years. i met her online and well we became friends. her behaviour towards me has changed recently. we used to talk for hours long and now it's just wierd ""hi""s and her checking up on my sanity now and then. i asked her what she's upto these days (to see if she's busy or caught up in things), but she is free actually. i mean ik why a person would not talk with you &amp; reply late - i get that but... idk. it feels like she's just not abandoning me because she feels sorry for me or shit. that's worse honestly - pity friends are the last thing i need.

and that's where my depression comes in. i just cannot tell the difference anymore."
2758,Anybody else get physical uneasiness?,Everyday I feel my heart feel uneasy with all the emptiness that I feel that dwells on the inside.
2760,Looking for tips/encouragement,"I (18F) have been struggling with feeling depressed for a very long time. I have some major issues with my family, which is for another post entirely, but because of that I've had to move out pretty much as soon as I was able and am now living on my own. I've had a lot of trouble with coping to be honest, I adopted a cat to keep me company and I love her but to be quite honest she's not much help. I have next to no friends, every relationship I've ever had has ended up with them just using me, and besides my DnD group once or twice a week I don't really have much social interaction with other people due to working full time and usually overtime every week. I have a kind of FWB relationship with a person, but honestly it's just making me feel worse about myself (again, a story for another post, another time). I plan on going to college if I'm able to next year, but honestly I'm unsure if I'll even last that long. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips on how to cope with depression by yourself, or ways to get out of my shell more and meet more people? Or even just healthy coping mechanisms I can use for when I'm at my worst? 

Sorry if this post is a mess/super long, my first real post and honestly am not quite sure how to use reddit yet"
2761,I messed up this decade,"I applied for a 5 year higher education course in 2011
While the course itself is pretty difficult to crack because of its competitive exam, I expected to clear all the exams in maximum 2-3 attempts

2019 is almost over and I have still not cleared my Finals

I am 26 years old and still trying to finish my education. All my friends are getting hitched and having good paying jobs

I failed myself, my parents, my friends and all those people who believed in me
I am a bloody loser who has not yet finished his studies, is jobless at 26 and not in best shape of my health.

Now I have subsided into depression.
The walls are closing in on me and I dont have much time left

Thanks for listening. Happy holidays.

May the next decade be good for everybody out there."

2763,Take control of your depression: strategies to help you feel better now - book by Susan J Noonan,"I’ve just started reading this book because I really need some way of helping myself out, and so far it seems pretty good. It reads like she really knows how we feel. It might even be good for the people in your life to read to understand us better. 

Has anyone else read this, and what were your thoughts? Any other books on depression that you would recommend?"
2764,My needy boyfriend,"So. This is the first time I actually post a story  to anything and I don't actually know where to post it but this feels semi appropriate.

Basically I'm 18 years old and my bf is 21. We've been together for about 5 months and we live about 3 hours away from each other. I spend a lot of time with him. A large chunk of each month I live at his house which is kind of nice but I miss my dog and horses and family. I also suffer from near crippling depression and am on a strong dose of antidepressants. 

Sometimes I forget my meds and he gets mad about it because I'm not acting happy or I'm a bit extra sensitive. Jokes about being tired and when I say ""same"" he gets mad and says I've done nothing all day to deserve to feel tired. 

When I get upset about him saying this he apologises and acts as if it was all just a joke and I'm acting unfair and taking everything so seriously. Like wtf bro.

I decided to spend about two or three weeks at home and then spend New Years at his place. He wants to come visit over the weekends which is nice but it's a 3 hour drive at least and then it's only really 24 hours together. Which is nice, sure, but still. In my opinion it's not a big deal to spend a couple of weeks apart (the internet has been invented if I'm not wrong, we can Skype and text and stuff like that) but he feels like it's too much. He's always texting me with stuff he knows means nothing to me. A good morning and a small chat before work is enough for me tbh. Then all throughout the day he's sending me random snaps and then calls me like 15 times in the evening even though I've told him that evening that I'm not feeling too well and don't really have the mental energy to talk. And he takes it personally and gets upset. Am I the only one? 

Sorry for the rant. Needed to vent, can't do it to my mom because she'd lose it and give me a big speech telling me indirectly to break up with him but when I confront her about it she denies it and acts as if I'm crazy. She really cares about him too. And I love him.... but apparently my love for him is not enough. He needs all my energy and time as well. Even when we (family on the farm) have a sick horse that requires near constant care. Thanks babe. Your crashed ps4 is for sure more important to me than an actual life.

Someone tell me I'm not alone in the needy s.o department."
2765,Is the horrible feeling depression?,"I suffered with depression a few years ago and was on Prozac. I managed to come off them and improve my mood massively through exercise and stopping drinking. However, every so often I wake up with what I can only describe as a horrible, dark, scary feeling that stays for a few days. It's really hard to describe other than a really awful feeling. I liken it to a nightmare where you just feel horrible and low. It's as if I could chew the feeling it's so heavy. 

Is this depression?"
2766,My sister got married yesterday while I was in the middle of an anxiety attack.,"Hey there, people. 

This text could be somewhat extensive for some people. 
Thank you very much to those who read until the end. 
Since I was 15 years old I am under antidepressants due to my anxiety, depression and gastrointestinal crises that I suffer since I was a child. I have always been an extremely skinny guy and that is an emotional and physical burden that I have been dragging throughout my life. At the beginning of this year I was weighing 115 pounds because I was going to a gym and for some reason, my gastritis didn't bother me for a while. Months later, I was fired from my job, which had me under a lot of stress. After I got fired from that shitty job, I started again with the gastrointestinal problems that I have suffered throughout my life. These symptoms are nausea, difficulty defecating and gastritis. These discomforts cause me sadness and too much anxiety when going out or eating.
Unfortunately I locked myself back at home as I used to do before I had the job. (Since I was 14 or 15 years old tbh) I have to clarify that I have always been a very lonely person and today at 24 years old, I can say that I am a virgin and I have never kissed a woman. Many would think that it is due to an inability to talk to women or something like that but that hasn't been the case all these years. Actually, several women have told me that I am a very intelligent and talented person in artistic disciplines. That I am one of the most interesting people they have ever met but usually these women also have their own burdens and shit. I have never liked such words or compliments because defining what intelligence is is very difficult in my opinion.


 I know that I have talent as a songwriter and the truth is, at the end of the day, today my most sacred shelters are music and books. Maybe today I would have the opportunity to have a girlfriend or friends but I no longer feel too much bond with people in general. I could have a beautiful woman physically in front of me and I will not think that it is the eighth wonder of the world or anything like that. For me it is just another human being existing in this shitty world. I could have a very cool and interesting woman and still prefer to be alone because I know that people are only temporary and I could never open up to someone who would later know all my secrets or deeper thoughts and then go away. I am no longer interested in making friends whether or not they are interesting people and women, inside, no longer attract my attention because I feel I cannot communicate deeply with them. I can make them laugh and make them feel comfortable and feel heard and understood but inside, I end up getting bored and feeling dissatisfied with people.
The only people I love are my parents, my sister and my beautiful chihuahua.
Not having a girlfriend or close friends affected me in the early part of my adolescence. It caused me a lot of sadness along with anxiety. This intensified when I decided at age 15 not to go to school anymore and study from home. Interestingly, today I have had the offer or the opportunity to kiss women and I have not taken the opportunity. It is no longer something that excites me. 
Ironically I have received oral sex from a girl but I didn't find it to be anything out of this world. It seems that sexual desire has also been decreasing considerably over the years and today I find more pleasure in masturbating at night when I am stressed while watching a porn video.
As I mentioned before, I am 24 years old and I went from weighing 115 pounds to 99 pounds due to these stomach symptoms that I have suffered throughout my life and that calm down for seasons as well as anxiety. I have always had problems eating that are mixed with anxiety. Lately, I have been thinking about the time food is in my stomach in case I throw up, I don't vomit too much. There are years when I can go to any restaurant and eat without thinking about anything, just enjoy and other times when thinking about going to a restaurant causes me an attack of horrible anxiety and many nausea. I have some degree of emetophobia and you can imagine how much my anxiety intensifies with this discomfort every time I get in a crisis. 4 months ago I started with nausea and difficulties to go to the bathroom again. I locked myself up again and because of the discomfort of these symptoms I couldn't eat anything because I wanted to throw up. 
They gave me horrible stomach ache and I see myself in the mirror looking like a fucking corpse.
I went to the doctor and after seeing poop test results, he told me that I have an inflamed intestine and gastritis due to anxiety again or a lot of stress. He has given me medication and I only calm down for a few days. Then, I return to where I was before. He says depression, anxiety, gastritis and irritable bowel are somehow connected. 

Yesterday my sister had her wedding and I was forced to go. Everything was going more or less normal until it was time to eat. I tried to eat and it made me nauseous and the nausea caused me anxiety attack. Actually, I think I had some anxiety before arriving. Halfway through the wedding, I went to the bathroom and my nose began to bleed for no reason. My eyes were red. I returned to the table and asked for the food to be given to me to take it home with me. My sister got angry and called me weak ass asshole and that I was just crazy and weak. Other people, apart from observing my extreme thinness, judged the fact that I was the only one who didn't eat at the table. On the way back, I almost cried but I was driving with my mother in the car and I couldn't park to cry. However, I did tell her how bad I felt. She understood me and gave me some comfort. I love her.

To be honest with you, I am already tired and I have reached a point where I can no longer stand going out and see how people stare at me for being too skinny or feeling stomach upset from the anxiety itself. Maybe it's my imagination or maybe those people don't even notice how thin I am. Maybe they don't even care but I feel terrible and I feel like a walking corpse. 
I can't stand these anxiety attacks, this existential emptiness and this lack of energy in my body anymore. Just as I can not stand nausea and visits to the doctor and being under medication. I would like to end this life once and for all but at the same time I don't have the courage to do it. Nor would I want to end my life since I want to record many of the songs that I have composed but I see more and more and more impossible the fact of fulfilling the goal of recording the songs and feeling calm for at least once in my life. Last time I felt happy was when I was 13 or 14.
Music is not cheap to produce and I don't even have a damn computer because in my third world country, everything is sold very expensive.

As I said before, I am not a person who opens up to others telling my problems because I have built a kind of bubble around where I want to remain in total mystery and anonymity in front of people. I don't want anyone to know anything about me, so telling all this on a social network like Reddit comforts me a bit and takes away the pressure of you guys knowing who I am or what my identity is; I can hide behind an alias. Even in music it is difficult for me to express myself with words since I feel quite exposed and usually my feelings are reflected in the melodies that end up being quite dissonant and quite dark.

Anyway, there are more things but it would be eternal to tell everything here in one post. Thanks to those who have read until the end. It has calmed me a little to get this out of my chest and know that someone reads me even for once in my life and feeling comfortable at the same time. 

PS: sorry for my spelling mistakes or grammar mistakes. English is not my native language.

Be safe, guys.
Love."
2767,All the meaning in my life left in a single second,"First time posting anywhere about mental health but I don't want to burden my friends and family with my issues so here it goes

The last 6 months have been an absolute dogshit smackdown in my life, my cousin killed himself almost a year ago now and the entire year I've been reconsidering how life works and what I want to do. I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago because the long distance aspect was killing me (I'd been sent to hospital for how intense my panic attacks were getting and I had no idea what was causing them). I'm having to drop out of university because I got fucked over by a company I worked for not paying me or giving me shifts for two months, meaning I've been deprived of food for that entire time. I managed to get back in contact with my ex and we spoke about going on a date to give us another try, and then yesterday I found out one of my ""closest friends"" was trying to get with her and invited her round the other night. Since I could remember I've been massively fucked up mentally thanks to the neglectence of my family, and various abusive relationships I've been in. So usually the only source of enthusiasm I find for living comes romantically, but now I feel that has left as not only have I been betrayed by a friend who knew what they were doing would hurt me a lot, I have lost my last chance at having an anchor that makes life worth living.

I've tried to overdose 4 times in the last 3 months and my parents thought making me an alcoholic would be a good laugh, so I also have drinking as a very destructive coping mechanism. I'm considering dropping my job to sit in a drunk bliss of sadness for the next few weeks before I move again.

I'm just so lost and I don't know if life is worth the effort of going forwards any more, I find more ways to punish and harm myself with every speed bump I come across and I don't think I can take much more. I've heard all the ""it gets better"" speeches at this point, and just want to know what people tend to do to better themselves, as while I really want to take my own life the thought of how it would affect my family hurts so much worse."
2768,Life sucks,"I'm going into the new year jobless, penniless, still very much depressed, unsure of my future, and probably dying of loneliness. I'm 21 with my life ahead of me but I can't help but notice this pressure of me that I have to become a success and be one right now this issue with that is I get little to no help or support and any major move I make it doesn't last. I live at my parents house and even though they are not verbally saying itbi know they think I'm a complete and utter failure and are slowly giving up on me. I'm in so much debt because of student loans and I plan to ho back to school which will put me into even more debt. I have these big goals and ambitions but I'm not sure how to go about accomplishing them and it feels like I'm all alone. If next year gets worse for me I'm not sure if living will be an option for me at this point."

2770,I just want one day...,"One day where no one will ask me to do something
One day where no will bother me
One day where no one will even realize I exist
One day where I can isolate myself from this world

One day where I can just be alone"

2772,Help me help someone,"So I have a friend who is unfortunately constantly suffering due to some traumatic events in their past. I seem to be one of very few people who know about this and as much as Id like others to be aware so they can support my friend too I wouldn’t want to betray my friend’s trust by telling other people, so it’s kind of a catch 22.  Im wondering if there is more I can do for them or what the best course of action to get them more help would be without betraying their trust. Thanks for taking the time to read this and all help is appreciated!"
2773,Here I am...one again.,"I feel filthy.It's driving me down low.
I had really bad dreams these days.Really morbid,disturbing dreams.
I compare my life to others again.
People stare at me with nasty looks,even if I didn't do anything.
I find myself having existential crisis over and over.Crying over and over how someone in the family has a better life than I do.Not even better,just happier.
I'm sick and tired of having this tough exterior.
I want love just like everybody else,and a great job,and someone to laugh with.I have nothing in here.I'm stuck in a box.
I want to cry and drown in drugs."
2774,Question,Does anyone have any experiences where the claim that “people have to go through the worst to get to the good part of life” is true? And does anyone believe this?
2775,I need to vent. Probably going to be the last thing I ever type. Today is the day I do something to help those around me for once.,"I've failed the ones I love. I've failed my family when they needed me most. I've failed them by ignoring their problems and shoving mine in their faces. I've failed them by hating someone that's much better than me. They deserve so much, they deserve the best of everything life has for them. I'm not it.

I honestly wish I could just disappear, taking all traces of myself with me. Take their memories of me. Take their pain I've caused.

I just want them to be happy. That's why I want to leave. I want to stop hurting them, stop burdening them.

How can I leave without them noticing? How can I just... fade from this world? How do I make them forget me? If I plunge a knife through my heart and my mind, will I fade away? Will they notice? What would they do? Would they call 911, or just leave me be because I've been such a burden to them?

I hope I can just end it all and fade away alone. Like I deserve. I don't want them to see me like that. To know that I was never really okay. I never told them how I really feel. How suicidal I've been. Yes, they know I was suicidal once. Honestly, I've lost count of how many times I've thought of just ending it all. It's in the double digits. High double digits. Not like I can tell them, though.

I can't say, ""Every time someone is mad at me, I hope I die. Every time I wish I could just disappear and stop hurting you. I'm so sorry for everything I've done to you. I didn't mean to. I just... never fixed myself after I was broken. I should've talked to you, asked for help. I just wanted you to think I was okay, but that backfired. I made you all hate me, despise me, regret me. I am a burden to you. I have failed you. Please know that I truly, honestly, love you. To make you happy and relieve your stress and burden, I will disappear. You won't have to wait. I'll do it somewhere else so you don't have to see me. So you don't have to see the fear, regret, pain, and sadness in my eyes. The eyes you love to see, so beautiful and blue. Filled with negativity. When I pass to the next place, I know where I'm going. It's somewhere dark and lonely and painful. Because I'm leaving this place with negative thoughts and feelings. At least leaving this way will ensure you don't have to see me when you move on. So please, be happy. Have a better life without me. It's all I wish. I know it's a lot to ask, but don't let me die for nothing. I'm dying to help you be happy. To live a full and happy life that doesn't include me. With all that said, I'm sorry. I know you didn't want to bury a child, but it has to be this way. Just know that I love you with all my heart, all my being. I'm doing this for you, so you'll smile again with true joy. Smile for me, will you?""

See, I've already thought everything out. Multiple times. I just never put action behind my words. This time... I have motivation. I know I can end it all right here, right now. I can make their lives happy and full again. I just want them to smile again. I miss their smiles, so happy and light. Not forced and empty.

I hope they never see me like this. I want them to either forget me, or remember the happy me. Not the depressed, suicidal, dead me. The me that needs help I can't ask for because I've already asked for so much. I'll get help, don't worry. The help I need is death, which awaits me.

Thank you for reading this if you did. I really did not do this for any attention or pity. I just needed to vent one last time. I hope my loved ones never see this, they wouldn't see me the same. They would pity me. I don't want that.

So on that note, I hope everyone is happy from now on. Even people I don't know. Be happy for me. This is my final goodbye. This life was good. I wouldn't trade it, no matter how many rough times there were. I love my family and just want them to be happy. Even if that means I must be removed from this life.

Goodbye."
2776,Does anyone else feel normal one minute then wish you were dead the next?,"I feel decent. I'm watching YouTube or I'm just browsing the internet and all of a sudden my mind is like: ""Everything in life requires effort and I'm way too exhausted to try. I have a long life ahead of me but it's too much of a bother. I don't want to live.""

Even if I'm feeling optimistic about my future and, ""what if everything really does work out the way I want it to?"" I feel like it's way too tiring to live the life I want and all I want is to sleep and do nothing.

Everyone says life is short but to me it seems so long and burdening and I don't want to do it. I think if I knew that I would inevitably drop dead in 10 years then I would feel a bit more motivated, but just knowing that it's likely that I'll have to wait 50 more fucking years before I might finally drop dead is like a giant weight on my shoulders."
2777,i just want to have some friends,"I've been feeling so lonely these past few years. Honestly i haven't had an IRL friend since i finished elementary school, so a long time ago. I have never been hugged irl because everyone just kept bullying me and nobody wanted to talk to me. My family never loved me either. Honestly i just wish i had someone to talk to, because i hate being lonely. I feel empty."
2778,Therapy is disappointing and I'm slogging through,"I've been really depressed since Thanksgiving and considered going back to therapy but I've had such awful experiences with therapists that I want to explore every other avenue first. First off, I don't have a great relationship with my family; I was bullied by them and my teachers and peers growing up and now in middle age I'm extremely self-conscious and shy. Everyone around me seems to have normal families and normal friends except me.

Getting back to the therapy piece, I was married to an older, abusive man for a decade who snored like a bandsaw, and as a result had bad insomnia. I was told I needed a psychiatry consult to get on klonopin to help me sleep as nothing else was working. The guy I saw practically smirked at me as I sat there tearful, and when he asked me what I wanted to do with my life I said ""I just want to quit my job and travel the world"", to which he replied, ""Well, why don't you just grow some dreadlocks then?"" Then the prick told me to ""just try to be happy"", recommended a book and a therapist, and wrote in my office visit note about how I looked ""professional"" (another reason I'm never taken seriously; how can a professional-looking woman possibly be depressed?? I know right? /rolls eyes) then my insurance was charged $600.

About 7 years before that I fell into a deep depression, lost weight because I was terrified to swallow food, thinking I was going to choke on everything I put in my mouth. In my intake I wrote that I had suicidal ideation and about my weight loss. The counselor asked me why I was there and after I talked for about three minutes told me, ""Most of my patients keep more to themselves at their first visit"" and then something about how I was talking too much. Then in talking more she asked me my profession; I replied that I was a dietitian to which she responded, ""I don't believe in diets"" (which had nothing to do with my job anyway) and continued to tell me for about ten minutes that she went to a holistic nutritionist who diagnosed her with vitamin C deficiency just by looking at her hands. Then she told me that I was just depressed about my job and needed to think about becoming a holistic nutritionist. She was actually referred to me by my employee assistance program at work. 

Don't even get me started on the last therapist I saw. They all just seem so judgy and SMUG, especially if you've ever fucked up in life and then they are judge and jury. Anyway, I just gave up and now my attitude is that therapists just get to do whatever they want, backed by a license, as long as they don't do anything too egregious and get caught. I'm very cynical. The blanket attitude of health care is ""you have depression? Then why aren't you seeing a therapist?"" along with tons of judgment about people with mental illness (including keeping people from getting care they need because of the idea that they can't care for themselves or something), despite this idea that we should all be wearing our feelings on our sleeves. 

This is mostly just a rant, but I'd feel better knowing others have been through this kind of thing too."
2779,My friends a risk to herself and I don't know that to do,"3 months ago my best friend admitted to me and a few others that she had attempted to commit suicide early this year taking a high dosage of back pain medication, and also admitted that she had been diagnosed with depression and has been taking anti depressants. Since then she has been a lot more open about her mental health, she sees a physiatrist often but still explains how she hasnt noticed any improvement. I try to talk to her as much as i can everyday and tell her how important she is and how much everyone appreciates her but have a very heavy schedule and can't text or call but for an hour or two a day. This morning she texted me  telling me that she had attempted suicide again  last night but had thrown up the three days worth of painkillers earlier this morning. Her mother has a general understanding of her depression, her psychiatrist suggested she goes to a hospital ward just last week for her own safety and her other friends dont understand the seriousness of her depression and that she remains a risk to herself. I don't know what to do in this situation. Do I try harder than i already have to console and speak to her even though its been unsuccessful up until now? Do I tell her other best friends and other friends, possibly breaking trust as she has only told me about the situation. Do i contact her family or do i contact her psychiatrist or a hospital? Id really appreciate any advice, thank you"
2780,Understanding my friend - Advice to help me better the friendship,"Hey,

I have a friend who I've been friends with for about a year now. He's very quiet and doesn't engage in much of a conversation. I'm in my second year at university and we are neighbors in our block of flats on campus. I know a lot about social anxiety and I don't think he has social anxiety because he does not avoid things and doesn't get hot/sweaty etc, and he can become argumentive...

When he does engage, it usually comes across as rude and even critical. In fact, the more I've thought about it, the more it comes apparent to me that when we talk he is only criticizing me or even being rude or being hostile.

For example, whenever I made a mistake, he will comment on it. I'm a very positive person and even when I've complimented him, he's looked at the issues.

For example, in a presentation we did as a team recently, he barely added anything to the powerpoint slides in the prep. He only looked over my shoulder and whenever I made a typo, he would quickly comment on it. It doesn't feel much of a friendship, but more of a nasty shadow over me at the moment. I added a ton of details to the powerpoint and made it look nice with GIFs. Unfortunately, there was a slight error during the presentation with the GIFs seemingly lagging the presentation - my friend smartly thought of a solution that fixed it during the presentation. I complimented him for this, for his quick thinking. I thought it is good to compliment someone who is quiet and thought of a good solution.

But after afterward me complimenting him, he would go start to on about my GIFs and ""no thanks to you...all those GIFs..."" (this was not done or said in a jokey way or manner, it felt very rude and hostile.. I'm very confused; when you compliment someone for doing someone thing.

Earlier today, I was upset over something and spoke to him, and he sided with a complete stranger by saying ""yeah, you should be sorry and then XYZ..""

I'm trying to work out the person in front of me.

Is it possible he has a specific type of social personality? I would struggle to ask him such a question because a) I don't want to come across as rude b) I do not know pretty much anything about him on a personal level since he keeps to himself a lot...

Thank you for your support in advance

Kind regards,

Dom"
2781,"December of 2018: 5 pills, not even the right ones. December of 2019: 1 pill, and one of the many right ones.","This month, if I recall correctly, I celebrate a full year of a new Psychologist and a new Psychiatrist, who both work as a team (they've known each other for years, more than anything), and who both have been trying to help me with my situation: My depression, my childhood traumas, my ocassional abuse of alcohol and/or marihuana, my dependency to my computer and more importantly to reverse the damage my past Psychiatrist did who prescribed me the wrong meds, and I didn't even knew that fully.

I still have a long road of ahead with my Psychologist (since I have to find a new one soon, too) but AT LEAST the meds side of myself has been dealt with, after almost of two years of experimenting, to say it in a way.

It has been hard. Really hard.

A lot of people have lived hell, and even still are.

I don't even know how to describe how I managed to get to this point, but from time to time my doctor reminds me how fucked up I was, how suicidal, full of anxiety I was. And it helps me to remember, since I struggle with my own memories since two years ago (more or less).

I hope you too, can find your own meds, and your team.

Lots of love from the South Pole, from South America, from Chile."
2782,"Failed two courses in college, don't know how to tell parents","I failed two courses during my first semester, I had severe depression during first half of the semester so I didn't care about the assignments or about the exams. I got a D in one and a D+ in another. I have been FaceTiming with my family this whole time and told them I was doing great. I wasn't strong enough to show my true self. They are thinking I have good grades and doing just fine. I will go back home in a couple of days and I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should tell them the truth, they will be so disappointed. I can lie because the college doesn't mail the grades to parents but I'm not sure if I can keep pretending to be happy and successful and lying to them. What should I do?"
2783,Why is human language so difficult to learn?,"(Sorry for the grammar, I just want to be heard) Whenever I'm with my group of friends, I'm often hyperactive at first but then I get distracted by my thoughts and I zone out leaving me alone with my thoughts. In every conversation there's always this invisible line that I have to cross to be part of the fun and everything. I really want to get past that line but my mind stops me everytime. 
By a tiny bit of chance that I get past that line, I speak but I get ignored so I isolate myself. My alienation stemmed from my own lack of belonging.

I really want to belong and I don't know how to."

2795,I need help,"I think it all started a couple of years ago. I had a girlfriend, my notes were going up and I was starting to finally be happy. And then the company my dad worked on crashed. It's called Abengoa, a Spanish company, if you look it up you may find it. Anyway, the only chance my father got was a similar job in another company. in Dubai. almost 8000 km away from everything I knew and loved. It hit me incredibly hard, and I was in deep water for a long time, but I managed to pull out, my girlfriend and friends helped me, my teachers supported me, and my family also helped me a lot, so I was fine. The move happened and I was lucky enough to find good friends in my new school, and even if some people didn't treat me well, I managed to not get affected. My notes did drop a bit, but they still were fine, and I visited my country again every once in a while. And then everything started to go wrong. My girlfriend dumped me for another guy 3 months ago, I started getting away from the people I've known since kindergarten, and my mom and dad are starting to get sick with age, my grandma is in the hospital, and now that I've travelled back to Spain for Christmas I have to stand seeing my ex with another friend of mine every day, I don't have any close friends I can talk to anymore, I don't want my family to get worried, because they are sick and they just wouldn't understand me, and I have to pretend to be fine in front of my friends while my heart is ripping apart. I just need a shoulder to cry on, and someone to tell me that they love me. So that's why I've come to tell my story on Reddit. Because I don't have anyone to trust and I have to come to an internet community looking for help. And still, I feel ungrateful because I know that there are people worst off, but I just can't stop being sad. What can I do? Can someone help me, in any way?"
2796,Failing exams,This year I completed lost interest in school and studying and I'm literally failing my exams because if it and I'm just too numb to care about that
2797,A solution for a better management of your depression.,"The Roman Stoics took a philosophical approach to melancholia and argued that mental and emotional disturbances were caused by having a faulty perception of one’s experiences and situation. These philosophers believed that how you mentally framed disastrous or stressful events could heighten or quell your anxiety (and consequently your melancholia). Thus, they argued that simply changing your cognitive perception of your circumstances could alleviate your mental anguish."
2798,When you have to stop your antidepressants because theyre too expensive,"And you finally thought you were happy and making progress but the whole world feels like its crashing around you and the headaches wont stop and you walk up every morning angry at God and yourself because you just want to die all over again.

Its so much fun 🙃"
2799,"My life is a mess, how can I begin to seek help?","There's a lot of aspects of my life that are all over the place and I'm discontent with. My career progression, what to do with my living condition, no motivation to pursue dating, struggling to pursue my passions. I think a lot of it stems from depression or something else wrong with me.

Im afraid whoever I seek help from won't be as engaged as I need, but at the same time I feel maybe just regularly talking to someone will help.

My last psychologist wasn't that helpful and let me go after they though I was okay. I got another referral from my doctor but having apathy going through the process again."
2801,"""When someone is in a deep depression, they're actually seeing the world with 20:20 vision""","Not suicidal, but incredibly fucking tired with a world I've grown bored of at the same time. Everything I used to like has slowly gotten worse. My hobbies have become unrecognizable and I lack the motivation to find new ones. People's politics has become rabid shouting from the end of every spectrum and cut great divides across basic civility. Friendships would rightly be so much fucking work, but for the little reward I feel I would actually be capable of receiving from them I think why bother. Doubly so with a romantic relationship, on top of a complete lack of self confidence where I can't even imagine myself with another."
2802,Boosting Self Esteem Through Believing (rant),"How am I supposed to know I'm doing something right when the tasks I do, be it basic like serving customers and cleaning up the store, feel so unnatural and often receive criticism in hopes to boost my own performance - but to no avail does it improve my skills. Am I suppose to believe in the thing that I'm doing right? Feel the magic from my brain and parts of my body working so that people can shut the hell up so that I can maybe convince myself that the thing I'm doing is the absolute? It seems like that's what everyone in every career is doing to establish their own legitimacy.
Even if I go on that route I feel like id more likely become some crazed whacko on the street spurting nonsense."
2803,I'm hurting but I feel numb,"I've been in love with the same person for the past year and a half, and a few months ago he finally said he turned my feelings and we were happy. He broke up with me a few days ago and I have never felt so broken before. I don't know what to do l. I'm in so much pain but I felt empty and cold and it's so scary, it's like im living on autopilot. It's so hard to smile or think about something else. He means everything to me, he's my entire world and all I want is him but he doesn't want me and I just don't know what to do. He asked if we could stay friends but the thought of having to see him and talk to him everyday while knowing he doesn't feel the same about me kills me inside. I thought it was bad when we were just friends but I've never felt this awful before, I've felt like this before with other situations and things but never this bad and never to the point where I can't get out of it. I feel like I'm stuck in this state of emotionless indifference and I hate it. I don't want to exist anymore. It's not that I want to die, I just feel so empty and numb yet I'm in so much pain and thinking about him hurts so much. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help myself. I have friends and people who support me but it's not helping. I just feel so lost."
2804,I killed myself in October,"I don’t think I will ever forget when I died.

I was in my room in my apartment at 4 am ready to plunge a knife into my heart. I didn’t care about the pain it would have caused, as long as my life was over. The knife point was resting on my chest. Somehow, I stopped myself. I put the knife in the scabbard, but it wasn’t over. I was afraid that if I just put the knife away I would just find it again and finish it, so I decided to throw it in the dumpster. At the dumpster, I felt something I never felt before. I suddenly couldn’t breathe properly, my head felt like it was about to implode, and panic set in.

This was when I died. 

I went outside as a human being, and came back in as some sort of undead ghoul. I can’t feel anything at all. I have no emotions, interests, or hobbies. I don’t care about anyone or anything other than keeping this body functional, my only comfort being that I can’t die twice. I wander the earth like a formless spirit searching for resurrection."
2805,“Merry” christmas and a “happy” new year,"Who else is looking forward to repeating the same shitty year over and over? Working your ass off so that the rich get richer just so you aren’t homeless. 

But don’t fret the fat cats at the top will wave the carrot of holidays, such as christmas and birthdays, to give you something to look forward to.

Nothing you can do about it though. Not that you would be willing to. No. You are too busy in the little free time you get. Stuffing your fat face with the latest sugar coated crap, created to make you want another. Your too busy watching shitty reality tv. Immersing yourself in other peoples lives more interesting than yours. Your too busy ordering food from your phone and letting the fat cats spy on your purchases and sell your data.

This is humanity. A collection of worker ants whose only purpose is to ensure that the one percent live well.

Merry fucking christmas"
2806,"365 days ago, I gave myself a year to turn my life around. Today, I celebrate my 23rd birthday alcohol free.","December 15 2018: I had just turned 22. My ex-fiancé and I broke up, and I lost the house we were buying together. I lived in a tiny dirty rat infested apartment in an expensive city. I had no direction, and was in a terrible bachelor's program. I cried all day and received no messages. I slept until 7pm, until I ordered a slice of cake off Uber eats, stuck a lit match it in, blew it out and wished myself happy birthday. Then I drank myself to sleep. I wanted to die, but told myself that I would give myself 365 days to make a better life for myself. If I didn't, then that would be it for me. 

Fast forward to December 15 2019

I moved countries, and now live in a much nicer cleaner apartment in a more affordable area. I worked my ass off to graduate and enter a Master's program here. I go out more and meet people even though it is still difficult. I was honestly dreading today as my social anxiety made me feel I had no friends, but I received a lot of love from people in my program. I don't plan on doing anything today, but I won't be drinking. I need another year before I have the confidence to plan a party for myself, but that is my goal for my birthday in 2020. Not everything is better, my current boyfriend didn't wish me a happy birthday. It may seem insignificant, but the fact he cheated on me in August just makes this the nail in the coffin. I choose to be happy today regardless. 

I just want to show people that success is possible, and for some it may seem like a very tiny victory, but this is huge for me. Things really can get better. It's hard to see improvement if you look at it day by day, but I finally see it 1 year later. If you're considering giving up, please don't. Give it 365 days."
2807,I didn't eat anything yesterday.,I thought it was funny until I threw up five minutes ago. Isn't depression great?
2808,Everyday it's for different reason. Today I'm crying cause I'm never gonna be a father.,"I'm suffering from depression since my childhood. I cry very easily. I cry everyday. Every time for different reason. Something comes to your mind, then it's just sucks you in like a black hole. Today I'm crying, cause I'll never be able to be a father. I'll never be able to hold a kid of my own. All my life I dreamt of being a father, holding onto a tiny person who's my own flesh and blood. I wanted to give a life to her/him, a life that I wish I could have.

Now as I know, I'll never be a father, it's just crushes me sometimes."
2809,Having a kid = constant depression,"Didn’t want to have kids. Wasn’t that I don’t like them, it was just the fact that I grew up verbally and physically abused at home and school. I didn’t want to raise a kid knowing that I never had a role model and I didn’t wanna screw up another generation. My mentality has changed so that I can only recharge when I’m alone. My wife gave me an ultimatum 9 years ago: “Either we have kids or I’m gone.” So, fast forward to today and we have a 7-yr-old. I love my boy and wife, but they are my anxiety personified. My son is disrespectful to me, and my wife is emotionally controlling and abusive. His disrespectfulness is a direct result of my wife not allowing me to discipline him. Whenever I try, she always thinks I’m “angry” and tells me to leave the situation. Because of this, my son rules the household. He is also INCAPABLE of doing anything on his own now. He won’t go to the bathroom on his own, get his own snacks/drinks, or play by himself. I hate playing with toys btw. If I try to correct this, my wife instantly comes down on me as being mean to him. Basically, we can never get a break. On top of that, I cherish silence. If there’s constant noise, it triggers my anxiety and irritability. My son never shuts up. He is always talking and very loud. I am now at the point where I dread being at home. I absolutely HATE WEEKENDS! I’m constantly told by everyone that I’m a “great dad and husband” but I sure don’t feel it. I guess it’s easy for people to see you as great when you’re constantly just doing what you’re told because there’s no other option. I am in therapy and on meds, as well as having resorted to opioid addiction so I can fake happiness, but as I told my doc nothing is helping. I don’t wanna commit suicide, but I really don’t give a shit if I die. I’ve actually prayed for it. I’m tired of everyone always thinking I’m in a bad mood and trying to get me to change, especially my wife who’s supposed to be understanding and supportive. Of course I’m on a bad mood, I’m fucking miserable because my voice and feelings always fall on deaf ears! 

TL;DR - having a kid has changed me into a bitter, depressed, drug-abusing, beaten down shell of a man who wishes for death. Yes, I know I’m an asshole. Fun stuff."
2810,"365 days ago, I told myself that if I didn't improve my life by Dec 15 2019, I would kill myself. Today, I turned 23 and my life around.","December 15 2018: Turned 22. I had just lost the house I was buying with my ex-fiancé. I was in a tiny apartment in an expensive city with a rat infestation. I cried all day. 3 people wished my happy birthday as I laid in bed. Got up around 7pm to order a slice a cake off Uber eats and put a match it to substitute the fact I had no candles. Then I drank until I passed out. 

December 15 2019: I moved countries, and graduated my bachelor's. Now working on my masters. I moved and now live in a more affordable city with a bigger apartment that is clean and central located. I struggle with social anxiety and was beating myself up over having no friends. I was honestly dreading today, but I woke up to a good handful of messages from people with sincere messages. I didn't get that last year. I won't be celebrating out since it's Sunday, but I won't be getting drunk alone either. Not everything is perfect, my current boyfriend who cheated on me in August didn't reach out today, pretty much sealing the nail in the coffin and confirming what I already pretty much knew. 

&amp;#x200B;

Improvement isn't linear. I went through a lot of shit this year. I told myself that I would give it 365 days to turn my life around. In a way, I did it. But I still have a long way to go. My new challenge in 365 days is to go out on my birthday with a handful of friends I now will challenge myself making during this time. It's a really small victory for me, but I truly had lost all hope a year ago. Please reconsider if you are thinking about ending your life. Give it 365 days, so much can change. And it's really hard to see progress day to day. Happiness is a constant battle and unending uphill journey, there will never be a destination. But it's worth the struggle. I'm in a much better place."
2811,Losing people over a book,"The title might sound strange to people but I'm no stranger to it. As a kid I've never liked books, I've never liked reading, the only exceptions were mangas because they had little to no text and more art so I could imagine things easier. Lately I've been losing people over arguments about how I don't like books and them trying to make me read more when I say no, losing the trust I've gotten with people because I don't like books. How can one bloody have friends if they get judged for nor liking books? How can someone lose all they have over books..."

2816,"ok,new year is coming. some of you will celebrate alone. i did last year and it was the only year i was depressed because of it. my depression began 1 week before 2019 and i wanted to kill my self in the first week of 2019. i didn't and you shouldn't. i live for my better future which is inevitable.","i'm still celebrating alone because it's impossible otherwise.

you can do it. YES you can! don't let your head be depressed. NO, what are you waiting for!? JUST DO IT. MAKE YOUR HEAD A BETTER PLACE !

study stoicism and you'll be unhappily happy."
2817,the meds aren’t working,"prescribed zoloft, active duty, friend recently killed himself, girl dumped me I have no friends, honestly want to end it still. it’s so hard recently and id rather just go. i don’t know what to do anymore.."
2818,Just really hate the state of my life.,"Ive been thinking about the state of my life lately. Everything from my friends to the things I eat to how much I sleep. And honestly it’s just so depressing. I feel really disappointed in myself. I feel like I’m outgrowing the friends I have right now. All they seem to want to do is talk shit about others or follow trends.  But what can I do? I’m lucky I even have friends. My grades are at an all time low. I’ve started to give up. But at least I’m not failing. I don’t do shit at home. I feel like my family hates me. Everyone thinks the youngest gets the least shit but it’s the opposite here. Everything is pointed to me. I take every blame, every fault, and every accusation thrown at me. I hate myself. I know I can look good if I try. But I don’t try. Even if I did I would probably be too broke to do much. I feel like my personality is boring. I feel unloveable. Guys throw themselves at me but for what? My looks? Every single day I question if that’s the only thing people appreciate. How I look. I rejected about four guys in the past two months. When my friends ask why they liked me they say : “She’s pretty.” It stops there. I feel like a failure because no one will love me for what I think. Who I am as a person. I have complex thoughts too. I hate olives and bitter vegetables. I want to see the northern lights. I only love cookies and cream because vanilla tastes too plain for me. I write poetry to cope with the world. My imagination is absolutely crazy. I prefer skipping small talk. But who would know that? Who would know when noone wants to get to know me? When all everyone sees is my face? All I’ve been thinking about lately is that I want someone who will hug me. Simply because they love me for me. Someone who will stay up with me until two am and open up. But the sad truth is that something of that sort would practically be impossible at my age. I’m friends with about pretty much all guys and one girl. But all those guys ever talk about now is sex. I fucking hate it. I get it.. it’s a human thing. But all the time? Where did the concept of actual love go? It pisses me off. I hate who they’ve become. Just immature, borderline stupid and sex hungry friends who suck the energy out of me everyday. Yet they’re all I have. I wish I could change my life. I love change. Yet it only happens when I don’t want it. How do I change my life? How do I get away from this repetitive draining cycle? I want to meet new friends but I don’t feel confident enough. It’s like everything I want to do, and I KNOW I should do is countered with something I hate about myself. I just want it to be summer already so I can figure my shit out. I’m going into tenth grade and I still haven’t outgrown my middle school phase. It’s pathetic. I just want to jump into a comic or a movie. I want to be someone else. Not like me."
2819,"""All it takes to become a master is 10,000 hours"" and yet I still have nothing to show","You'll hear it around every now and then, 10,000 being the amount of time needed to become a master, or the first step to being good at something is being bad at it, or the master has failed more than the student has ever attempted, all in an effort to urge students of any craft to not give up in the face of adversity. Similarly I've heard countless times the tale that talent is a myth, invented as an excuse to never try, all in the vain of, you can do anything you set your mind to.  
  
I suppose I should give a bit of background. Aside the depression, I have two lovely conditions that make life just that much more difficult. First Aphantasia, the inability to see with my mind's eye, basically I have no sensory imagination, smell, touch, taste, and most importantly hearing and sight. I can describe a thing from memory, but I can't close my eyes and see it, and I can't hear a sound in my head, even if I could mimic it. The second is Disgraphia, which is a lack of fine mother control, and my particular type of it has some symptoms in common with dyslexia. Despite having these problems most of my life they were never a problem early on. I was put in remedial classes without really being told why, which was hard given that my issue was more a motor function issue than a learning one, like proper dyslexia, add, or the more problematic neurological issues of my piers. It wasn't until I wanted to do more than be passable that my problems actually became road blocks.  
  
I'll admit I'm lazy, and maybe in the end that's the only reason I wallow in self pity over the things out of my control, but I can't really say I'm good at anything. I've sink years of my life playing videogames, and sure I'm fluent enough to beat most any game I sit down with, but no matter the practice I put into anything competitive, I can't rise beyond the norm, years playing call of duty and Halo in highschool, or league of legends since then, and the best I can do  statistically, and objectively is OK, and even working to that point took hard work, time and effort. But games are games, so long as one is having fun it doesn't matter if you win or lose, only a few dozen can go pro at any given game, so what of practical skills.  
  
 In college I broke rather hard. My Depression was at its worst and upon flunking out I finally went to get help in an effort to become stable again. The problem was that I could write or type fast enough to get by in highschool, but my hands couldn't keep up with the work load. Essays are taxing to write, or type with my daft hands, my notes are illegible, and I suppose I was too proud to be caught with a tape recorder. Thankfully at that point I was only three semesters in, so I admitted defeat and went into the workforce.  
  
After a few painful years of service industry work I started work in light industrial, and trade settings, but I feel out of place, I'm slower than everyone around me, and I've been laid off twice in the past year. Thankfully I keep finding work somehow, but I'm not sure I can take another job letting me go because I'm not one of the important employees to keep from downsizing. I guess so long as food is on the table, work need not define me, as there are other things in life that can give one meaning.  
  
Despite being blond in my mind's eye, or maybe because of it, I've always had an appreciation for artists. My mother, in her free time, is a painter, and plays with mosaics, my grandfather a carpenter, and my brother was a cartoonist for a while. All throughout my life I wanted a part of that, and about three and a half years ago I set aside occasionally doodling, and various sketches, buckled down and began to work on my fundementals, making sure to draw for fun on occasion, use reference, figure draw, I even studied books and online courses. Three and a half years later and I can't manage to manifest a drawing at will. If I'm lucky, I might be able to push an illustration to a finished state, it might even look good, but despite all that training all that work, maybe one in twenty times I sit to draw, I can see a piece through. I've invested in a tablet to work digitally, to help get me past the hurdles of my dysgraphia, and yet I will spend hours trying make the creative process work and yet nothing.  
  
All around me I see people smiling and saying, ""You're doing fine, with some hard work you'll get there,"" but to me it just feels like ""Great, you've learned the rules, maybe if you tried harder you'd get there."" I know I shouldn't be focusing on my work compared to others, and that there's more to life than ones skills, but it hurts whenever I try to make something of myself, and all that I'm greeted with is passed time. I find myself not wanting to try new things, why learn a new game for my friends to dance circles around me, why bother picking up an instrument I'll never be able to play, why go back to school if you'll only flunk out again.  
  
Even looking to philosophy has me on a rather sour note. The mind being that last refuge when the body has failed. I used to find a degree of comfort in existential nihilism, the thought that despite life being meaningless, we can create meaning for ourselves, but what meaning can I create when the things I wish to be good at elude my grasp. For a while I found peace in Taoism, and Zen, the philosophies of going where life takes you, and embracing what comes naturally, but passivity can only sasiate for so long, before hours in front of a canvas, or loss after loss begin to make one yearn to do nothing but sleep.  
  
The older I get, the more I wish that time and effort were the only exchange for skill. Even after long days working I still have time in abundance, and practice isn't all too bad. Hell I can't even lean on my conditions as an excuse since when I go online I see others with them who say ""Yeah just practice more"""
2820,My best friend of 14 years and I had a fight,"Well, now I have 0 friends instead of 1. I am hopeless."
2821,I want to kill myself because I'm short,"I hate being short, I feel like I have little to no chance of happiness and I am just going to die alone. I have tried to see multiple therapists on the issue but it never gets me anywhere, I feel like I am so close to suicide but I really don't want to die. I feel like there is no other option as I am so ashamed that no one could ever be attracted to me."
2822,How to tell people you have depression?,"As a 26 year old guy who never had issues getting women and loved going out and playing football and working out and socialising to becoming a shell of that. Not interested in sex, I've put up on 38kg, I get anxiety attacks and itchy prickle like feeling all over my head, back, neck and chest when I'm around too many people. I've been diagnosed severe clinical depression and anxiety and see a therapist, not on any medication yet as it will be my last resort, I rarely leave my apartment, I no longer shave, I skip showering without really caring, my dental hygiene is horrible but I'm trying my best to get myself  back together. I feel like I've lost who I am or was to be honest. 

Now to the issue at hand my friends are rather immature in the way they literally can't piece together what's going on with me and instead call me a pussy for not wanting to go out drinking or not playing footy,  they're aware I haven't had sex or kissed a girl in a long time and just resort that to me being a pussy or can't close women. I've told one of my friends once that I had depression as he was making a joke of it about someone else when I was younger and he still laughed i hit him in the arm HARD, as I don't wanna actually harm my friends. He got the idea after that I was serious. It's getting harder to avoid telling them as I'm constantly pressured to do things, constantly teased about girls and being fat now, being unemployed and to them ""not doing anything to find work.

How have you told your friends group what you're going through? Im scared they'll treat me like I'm fragile and will never see me as normal again when I do eventually get through this. Bare in mind this is a friends group I have known since I was a child, so immature and stupid as they are they're all I know and have."
2823,Anyone feel like they are going to die alone?,"Anyone else have nobody to talk to since you don't want to look ""weak"" or ""depressed"" but constantly think if you don't change you're going to die alone but can't change but don't have the voice to talk? Its been rough man but idk what to do."
2824,"Maybe the Wrong Place, but advice please","I've started seeing a guy and its pretty clear he has some major depression.  Now as someone who struggles with severe anxiety that spirals into minor depression occasionally,  I understand to a degree.

I don't want to fix him or heal him but I want to support him through what he's going through.  He seems to have been hurt by relationships and is reluctant to call what we have as it is. Thats okay. Whatever caused this severe spike messed him up.

I just want to be there for him and be a caring individual. So I don't want to say anything stupid or triggering. Any advice on how to offer the best support I can or help him find his footing again would be great.

Maybe hes not ready for a relationship but I feel like I can still be a positive experience for him. So maybe one day, he can find the person he deserves."
2825,Does anyone else feel like they are beyond a point of recovery?,"I’ll start off by saying I’m currently only 18, so I’m still pretty young with plenty of time left but I have absolutely nothing going for me and am so far down that it feels impossible to fix. I completely failed my last year of high school, I was incapable of passing a single one of my classes. I have horrible crippling social anxiety to a point where I cannot properly speak to people in real life, Whenever anyone tries to speak to me the most I can ever muster the courage to say are short one word responses. I lack any true companions in my life, I am 18 and do not have a single friend, the only immediate family I have is my single mother, and while I truly do care about her it’s hard to find a reason to believe she feels the same way about me, I feel like I’m often treated as a burden and she doesn’t take my mental health issues very seriously.

When you combine lack of success, inability to communicate and having not a single soul who seems to care about you at all, it feels literally impossible to escape."
2826,"So, the only place where I feel good is in my fantasies :P","It's sad but oh well
Think I'll work hard to make them become real life"
2827,I’m seriously considering killing myself,"I fucking hate how everyday I have a different mind set, I wish I’d want to kill myself all the time so I can actually have the guts to finally do it one day"
2828,Im gonna be sick,"Too much anxiety, I really dont feel well"
2829,So I learned today that I'll never be able to talk to my dad about my depression,"I kinda already had a hint of it from him saying a few times in the past that suicidality is just stupid among other things, but today there were some people talking about mental health and that on TV, and he started talking about how it's all fake and shit.

I can't really be mad at him since I'm almost certain it's a coping mechanism, but it just kinda sucks that one of the few people I feel like I can be completely honest with who actually care about me isn't an option for this.

I don't think I can tell my mother either, she'd probably just make things worse. I'd rather not get into why I think that, though (also I lack that kind of connection where I can talk about anything with her anyway).

That leaves my brother, who I'm pretty sure is struggling from his own issues and mental illness. I feel like the emotional baggage of knowing what I'm going through wouldn't help him at all, in fact quite the opposite.

Even my friends who know about my depression, I can't *really* get into it, y'know? You guys are basically the only ones I can talk to straight about this. As nice as that is, text just doesn't have quite the same impact as a human in front of you. For me, at least. God damn human brains valuing human connection and shit."
2830,Haven't been happy in a while,"I haven't been happy in a while, always tired, and just want to be alone. I don't want to get back on meds because it kills my sex drive (granted my wife would be ecstatic about that). I've been running on a delicate balance of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol to function. 


For years ive been ready to die (not suicidal, so dont start that crap)."
2831,I am so tired of living and having to do things,
2832,I'm tired of this,"The hardest thing trying to talk someone out of suicide is that secretly, you just want to do the same thing."
2833,Self-harm is no longer scary,"It's been three days since I have been hurting myself, I do it every time I go take a bath. I have always wanted to go quickly, so cutting was always scary. Until a few months ago... I started cutting myself, not too deep, everytime I did something wrong, as a form of punishment for myself.
 It would make me feel better after, like ""now it's fair"". After that I started hurting myself where I know it may actually hurt me for days. Then I got better and stopped. Until three days ago. I went back to slightly hurting myself. I'm scared I will keep doing it. But I feel the need to, is the way I found to make things fair.

It's been hard to talk about what I feel, I don't even understand what I really feel, no one really understands it or cares to, all I know is that the bad things that happen are mostly caused by my choices, I am the one who choose to believe in people, I'm the one who decided to eat more than I should  (i'm in a diet). It's my fault and I deserve it.

I can't go for help for anyone, I really feel like no one understands what I am going through now, and I can't afford a psychologist in my country.

How do I stop? I swear is the only thing that it's been making my chest feel less heavy these days."
2834,What am I?,"My life is just a depressing theater.
My mother keeps destroying my brain, I was forced to go away living on my own one year ago, I run away with the help of my boyfriend and friends from a bad episode o violence and psychological abuse, I have also reported them to the police (in the same time I graduated and worked really hard), now because of paperworks I have to stay home with her and my family again. And I will be forced to stay here until some crap about inheritance will be fixed.
(i am not living in US by the way, here law are different about hereditary succession).
My brother hates me, he said that I am dead for him, I not allowed to go in common spaces at home with him otherwise he is calling bad words ""you are a whore"" ""you suck""...
My mother instead tell me that no one could ever love me like she did, that I will see in the future how my boyfriend or my friends will abandon me, she also told me that ""I am killing her"" and that she has cancer. They made me feel like a criminal because I dared to report them at police that time.
My father is an useless man that never defend me, he is just scared of my mother and brother I suppose or maybe he is not giving a shit about me, don't know.
I have serious problems with my boyfriend too, our relationship goes to the wreck because of this story, sometimes I think that we are not really meant to each others, I feel like he is not really understanding about me and maybe I am not understanding about him.
I am scared my mother is a narc, and worst of all I am scared I could be one too, or could become like her. 
I am not satisfied about my friends too, I am constantly feeling alone also in the middle of people, I am feeling disconnected from anyone and anything.
I graduated with the best grades couple of months ago but I have now no motivation no reasons and no strength to find a job in my field, I don't even like the things that I studied so hard.

I lived a childhood and a teenage completely alone because of my parents believes, than I started university trying to be happy so hard, I made friends, I found a boyfriend, I rebelled to my parents psyco strict rules because I don't want to be disconnected from the world anymore, but now I feel just like a loser, I not only feel disconnected from others around me I am also feeling disconnected from myself, that is strange but it is like I am a robot, I am able to do my routine in order to stay alive but I feel nothing, just despair and loneliness sometimes. I also cry very often about the smallest things.
The only one knowing partially my inner emotional state is my boyfriend but this is scaring and upsetting him, he is also depressed but for other reasons.

What about I am not here in the world anymore? I am not really scared to kill myself, but I think sometimes why suffer? For what? There's nothing worthing my attention, just pain in the world and in my life."
2835,"Academically smart, but a failure in social life","I have no else to talk to, friends, family, or anyone. Because this is the same problem, and i afraid they are tired of it. I cannot help it, i want to fucking die. I am so incompetent, no friends, and useless. Academically smart, but cannot do anything for my final Exam project because my only purpose in life is to write something on a paper. Fuck, why i cannot just be happy like every normal person? I don't ability to write on a fucking paper, i need the ability to be become a functional human being. Fuck, i want to cry, i want to fucking cry"
2836,I don't know how to react to suicide,"I'm just going to pen my feelings down. 
I feel helpless. Utterly. I feel I may say the wrong things. Or accidently encourage suicide. I don't know if I can do anything to talk anyone out of it. 

I have never felt so sad. So many unanswered questions. So many ""why""

I'm at loss of words. I don't feel like eating anymore. I don't feel like smiling or laughing because I wasn't able to do anything or pray or hope harder that things get better. I cannot comprehend the possible pain they are going through. 

I think I may be destabilising knowing that I have lost ppl and will lose ppl this way. But I also have a fair idea where they come from. And also understand their hopeless and why they thought this was the only way out. 

I just hope it never has to end this way for anyone.

I wanted to know what are the most appropriate things to say if a person has decided they want to end their life and there is no changing of their mind?"
2837,I feel so incompetent and creepy,"I recently downloaded Tinder in hopes of expanding my relationship status. I made some effort on my profile, tried to look good, etc. But while I have matched with a few people, and even started conversations, I feel like I keep getting ghosted because I inevitably slip up or say something stupid. I must say that I am not good at flirting and such. I have EXTREME approach anxiety, born from years of social isolation and a traumatic experience from my past. Everytime I realize I might have been too forward I break down with the desire to apologize desperately for being rude. Usually I just say a simple apology but it's already too late. And as a result I fall into a downward spiral of self loathing at my own incompetence and stupidity. I have studied so much dating advice (from feminist sources and such. Screw you incels, I blame you for the dating scene sucking.), but I always screw it up in the heat of the moment, either by being too forward or too timid. I hate it. I hate myself. I've tried and tried and tried. In my whole life only one person has felt me desirable, which I consider blessed, but I cannot shake these feelings that I am an ugly, worthless, incompetent, creepy bastard. I know, I know, I shouldn't complain, but STILL!

I just wish I wasn't me. That I wasn't so SCARED."
2838,"So, nobody wants to be around me",I dont know what I've done wrong. Why can't I just fit in?

2840,"24yo, zero friends since ever. People just do not like me. Who to enjoy life alone?","I haven't had any friends since my only friend found a boyfriend two years ago. He didn't want her to have dudes as friend and she agreed with that. Apart from her I didn't had any irl friends.

Since then I only had two online friends. One of them I've met irl but she never wanted to see me again. The other was my most important support for 5 years, but she's ignoring me since more than a half year.

There were a few people who I thought a friendship is possible. I tried writing a lot with them to finally ask them to hang out, but they never wanted to meet me.

When I'm interacting irl with people, they quickly leave me alone and don't show any interest in hanging up with me. It gets worsened because I'm always the first victim to spread false rumors about me. Always.

Well there was one guy who was interested in doing things with me, but unfortunately I didn't like him and found him annoying. He was stalking my online activities which lead me to creating a new reddit account.

Whenever I try to interact with people, they don't like me. It's not easy to be depressed and suicidal, but it becomes even worse when there isn't anybody who cares."
2841,My life is spiraling out of my control,"I'm going to try and keep this as coherent as I can. If I start to ramble, I'm sorry.

9 months ago I would've said things in my life were pretty good. I was happy at my job, was about to get a promotion, had a handle on my future and what I wanted to do.

Now... I feel like I have no prospects and no direction. My job has taken a massive turn for the worse, which is the primary cause for why I feel this way. My attempts at finding another job have been a 13 month long string of rejections (despite me earning my bachelor's). To be honest though, I almost don't want to get another job. I've been getting screwed over at my current job for so long it just feels like i'm going to go somewhere else to have the same thing happen, just with less pay. 

I'm engaged. This is a good thing, and we have a good relationship. But she unfortunately never finished high school. I've tried nudging her in the right direction, but completing her education isn't important to her. Which unfortunately means she doesn't have much in the way of job prospects or income, so supporting us mostly falls on me.

I guess I just feel stuck. I'm tired. I'm reaching the point where I want to give up. I just don't see a point in trying anymore."
2842,Can you build muscle on Zoloft?,"I've just started Zoloft.
I'm 16 percent or so body fat. I wanna be less than 12 and continue to build muscle.

I've read zoloft makes you fat and lose muscle.

Anyone built muscle and got into shape on these meds?"
2843,"Okay mods, lets see if this post gets any attention.","I know, this is petty, but a lot of the times, my posts in r/depression don't get many replies, if any, so I feel I should delete them. What's the point? They get ignored anyway. I'm not allowed to use a joke as a title so I guess I can watch this post get burried. 

When i see everyone else get showered in attention, I become angry and bitter because I feel like I'm inadequate and don't deserve attention because I'm boring and have nothing interesting to say. It triggers me a lot to see people just roll in the upvotes. I guess I'm doing something wrong. 

I'm just super angry and need to vent. Either way, if no one responds, this proves I'm right. If someone responds, then I get attention. If this gets deleted, I'm honestly not going to be surprised. If anything, it'll be interesting."
2844,Anyone else feel this sick dreaded feeling all the time?,"Like I feel guilty all the time, I’m always always alone, my husbands a chef and works till like midnight so I’m alone all the time when I get up at 5 to do my morning job where I clean before anyone gets there so I’m alone there, go home and then I’m alone, when my husband is at home he watches tv and doesn’t speak, I have no friends I’m very introverted so it’s sort of my fault, I just feel this weird sick feeling all the time, if I eat I feel guilt, when I sleep I have awful nightmares and just feel dread all the time, I came off setraline 3 months ago because it was making me continuously hungry, can’t go back on that, I just feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I feel lonely yet when I’m around people I’m scared and socially awkward 😔"
2845,"Life was never happy, nor it will ever be. If you think otherwise, quit fooling yourself",
2846,Medication question,"So I have been put on citalopram for about, and thought I was doing fine. Recently though friends have said that my personality seems more erratic, my moods (while not swinging) have been more extreme, and I have noticed a pattern of high-risk behaviour developing.


Going to bring it up with my doc on my upcoming med review, but my question is whether I should stop taking it now to see if the high risk behaviour stops, or so so with the help of my physician/pharmacist?"
2848,"I constantly scream in my head ""Somebody please talk to me!""","I find myself constantly saying this to myself, thinking someone will ""hear"" it and talk to me or shoot me a text. All because they hear my screams, feel my pain, acknowledge my existence. I can't realistically expect other people to initiate conversation with me, because for years now I've had to be that person. And if I'm *lucky*, I get one-word responses within a week; usually it's nothing. 

I've been fortunate to meet some really great people in the past couple of years of reaching out, trying to be more social, and making more friends, but so far all of my efforts to keep those connections alive and a conversation going have been one-sided or met with indifference. Yeah, we're Facebook friends, but they still feel like strangers. I want to hang out, learn about who they really are, do secret santa's during the holidays, go bar hopping, hiking, and all of the activities! Instead, indifference. Utter indifference. Feeling unloved, unwanted, hated...of course they're terrible feelings to have. But so is the realization that your very existence can come to an end at any moment's notice, and nobody would care or bat an eye. Indifference. Emptiness. Life goes on. I am tired.

Going back to the title of my post, I know these thoughts merely get lost in the void. I know nobody can actually hear them...that's not the point. For some reason though, there's something about internally screaming that seems to help me feel just a little better. I labor under the hope (you can call it a delusion) that one of my screams will be heard. Some day. Maybe."
2849,Just need some reassurance,So I was really thinking about calling it quits last week. Have just been feeling alone jo matter what family or my few friends tell me. Job wasn't looking good and tired of debt from student loans. So me getting a shit idea decided to go talk to a military recruiter. All and all that didn't work out. Now on top of that the girl that I've been talking to that has been the only thing that's kept me happy through all of this has just been using me to up her emotions. It seems she's friendzoned me or something and ran back to her ex. I just don't the point anymore there's only so many times negatives happen till you really cant give or even feel feelings anymore. Just feel more alone than ever
2850,Where to look,I’ve been feeling worse than usual lately. It would be nice to vent and receive feedback but I’m not sure where I should go about doing that. Friends and family are out the question. Any feedback would be great thank you!
2851,Anyone ever feel like nothing is real?,Nothing feels real. The sensation of touching and touching objects around the house gives a weird feeling like this is all fake. None of this matters. Reality is a dream that I can’t get back to
2852,What's the point.,The word pointless sums up my existence. Just when I think I'm turning a corner.... boom. I wake up feeling like I just wanna put my head under water and and take the biggest breath.  No matter what I do my confidence deteriorates by the second making me feel so worthless and then when it gets where I am now I contemplate existence. I hate being fucked in the head I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
2853,I wish I was happy,"I’ve been waiting for it for so long, but I know it’ll never end. I’m inclined to kill myself, and that day will be any one of these days."
2854,Depression,I hate being depressed but I wish I could go back to high school where I was always saddened deeply to the point of frustration and arguements in my head. I would rather be feeling sad than nothing at all at this point. Every day is rinse and repeat. Homelife is extremely taxing on my psyche as is college and my parttime job. I don't have time for any recreation unless its in bed on my laptop before I sleep and start the next day just as I did the previous. I haven't felt a thing when my friend drown when I was out of state for 8 and  a half months nor when my grandma passed away at home from cancer one year and 5 days ago. I feel numb to everything and to exhausted to fight the flow of things. I'm not quite sure what to do at this point but continue the rinse and repeat cycle.
2855,I just sliced the shut out of my arm,"I don’t know where else to put this. I’m too embarrassed to tell anyone who actually care about me cuz I feel like I’m just letting them down. So I figured I’d just post it here to some random people who might be going thru the same thing. 

But yea I just sliced the shit out of my arm. I can’t explain why. I went from feeling confident to having an insane breakdown and just lost it. I was blasting music and head banging and slamming my arms against everything in my bathroom and took some fingernail clippers and just lost it. It doesn’t make sense. I just got diagnosed with anxiety and underlying depression or whatever the fuck but this is the worst I’ve ever been. It’s not even feeling down on myself like I usually do. I just feel empty. Like there’s nothing in my body and some weird impulse made me do that in order to remind myself that I was actually there. Even tho the shit didn’t hurt. Idk. I kno I need help. I kno I need to work this shit out but I just texted in to work at 3;20am saying I couldn’t go in. I feel so guilty and disappointed in myself. Idk. I just had to get this out there. I’ve lost so many people in my life this year that would kno what to say. And how to be there. But they’re gone. So I hope someone else understands. Thanks"
2856,I am miserable and I feel like I can't talk about it anymore.,"This is my first post. I'm sorry for the grammar mistakes. English isn't my first language.

I was diagnosed with depression a year ago (due to sexual abuse as a child), and I started taking medication and going to therapy. I also told my parents, they have supported me financially and emotionally, however I feel that I've hurt them both deeply by letting them know about my depression. My mother constantly blames herself for what happened to me, I can see the sadness in her eyes when she asks me (frequently) how I am doing. She thinks she has ruined me and hurts me so much to cause her that amount of pain. 

Last year I moved out of town with my boyfriend (he is aware of the situation and also support me) and started a new job, but honestly I don't feel any better. My contract is over now, I am unemployed and I feel sad and helpless, but I don't think I can express my feelings without making others miserable in the process.

I feel alone, despite being surrounded by people who love me and care about me.  

I just don't know what to do anymore."
2857,"Hi, I turned 16 today",Can I get a birthday wish? Nobody wished me lol
2858,I(23/M) feel as if I am not salvageable at this point.," 

I not very articulate so I apologize if I seem to ""jump"" around.

I first felt suicidal in middle school. Later it turned into a deep and persistent depression that I still feel today. As a result I never cared to develop hobbies or social skill because why would I? I never expected to be here. I expected to be dead. I graduated highschool in 2015. I applied to college and got into a known but rather mediocre college, Georgia Southern University. During my time there I attempted to improve. I met some people, I went to social events, and I did average in terms of grades. I was majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the time. But my mental state degraded more and more. eventually my desire to improve dissipated, I began to lose social connections and my grades slumped. Come the second semester of my Sophomore year(2017) and I needed to take a medical withdrawal. I came back home for a semester in order to try and get better. During my time at home I enrolled at West Georgia University and took 3 extremely easy classes because I was so so afraid of falling behind academically. It was a stupid thing to do but I wasn't being very rational at this time. I went back to GSU fall semester of 2018 and the depression hit the hardest it has ever hit just a few weeks in. Near the end of the semester I began to self harm,drink heavily, and get high almost every night (22 at this point btw) and when I told my psychologist she rightfully had me committed to a psych hospital. I spent 9 days there where I was diagnosed as Bipolar. Initially I felt hopeful. I finally had a solid diagnosis that I could get professional help for. After I got out I came back home yet again. I am now 23 and turning 24 in July. a few months ago I was admitted to another psych hospital(this time voluntarily) and spent 8 days there. After I got out I spent 2 months in a intensive outpatient program that the hospital ran. I came to the facility at 8:30 am and left at 3:00pm everyday for 2 months and I have never felt more alone in my life than before. There were about 30 other people around my age that were going through the same things that I was and they were/are sill more productive and successful than I am. To give you an idea as to how socially incompetent I am the doctors tested me for autism. I'm not autistic according to the doctors I'm just socially awkward. presently I am enrolled at KSU. I have failed 2 of my 3 classes for this semester. I will have to switch majors. I'm thinking of going into software development but I don't know. I am living in the basement of my parents house and I am unemployed because I just cant handle a job right now. At 23 I am already this much of a fucking failure. I have been seriously considering suicide but if I do decide to do it I will do it after Christmas. I just don't see any hope for me. I am too far gone. I don't even feel like a person at all. I don't know what to do and its tearing me apart. I'm so so tired. I'm tired of being a failure. I'm tired of being a disappointment. I'm tired of being this apathetic husk of a human being. I want to go home but I don't know where home is.

I don't know what to do anymore."
2859,The roller coaster of depression,"Had a decent couple of days as far as mood goes and today I’m in the dumps, big time. I’m really frustrated with the ups and downs I’m experiencing, and an adjustment to medication hasn’t helped at all. I’m on the verge of tears and am trying hard to keep it in because I’m at work. 

Woke up in a good mood today and driving to work, some idiot driver pissed me off and it’s been downhill ever since. Lots of little things have been popping up and reminding me of unpleasant things/times in my life, compounding the depressive mood. 

Started writing this the other day and didn’t get to finish it cuz I broke down crying...at work. So thankful I was able to see my best friend when that happened, he is always seems to know how to make me feel better. 

What are some constructive things y’all do to help get out of that kind of mood?"
2860,I hate being female,"I hate being a female attracted to other females. Women want men, women want muscles who can protect them, women want real dick, women want someone who can give them kids, women want someone who isn't submissive. That is not something i can ever provide. I fucking hate being a woman, i fucking hate myself."
2861,I don't understand what's wrong with me.,"2 years of ups and downs. 2 years of joy and agony. 2 years to make up.

We were such good friends in the beginning. We were so innocent. We enjoyed each others company. But I had to f*ck it up in the end. I had to f*ck up so many times because of my lack of f*cks given to how she feels. I'm such a horrible person who doesn't know boundaries. I changed for her at one point. But it wasn't enough, she still thinks I'm the same person as before. I've broken down crying in my bed thinking about her. I miss her so much. I miss her so much it hurts. I want to talk to her again. I want to be with her again. It feels so lonely. I literally want to die everyday because she meant everything to me. I had a goal when I was with her. I can't deal with the guilt. We could have had our one year. But we broke up. We could've stayed friends. But I didn't care about her space. She was so quick to move on. She didn't care about me. And I cared about her so much. Why do I do this to myself. I'm such a pathetic weak insecure person with abandonment issues."
2862,Waking up is the worst...,"Every time I wake up I’m more emotional than usual. Thoughts come flooding back... I can’t help but lose it. I begin to cry and wonder why I’m like this? all day yesterday I was fine. Spending time with my son, no thoughts of death and went without shedding a single tear. My mother shined light on how I can cope with all of this. She says I’m handicapped. I laugh when she says this, but it’s 100% true. Those of us battling mental illness is the same as someone with a physical disease all can see. Yet, the society sees us as emotional basket cases that “play the victim, overthink, or take everything personally”. Today, I woke up. Literally and metaphorically. It’s time to fight back. Fight against the thoughts, the feelings, telling this sickness I will be victorious."
2863,Does anyone else feel a sense of bliss when they think about not existing?,
2864,My parents don’t believe in mental health,"I had a panic attack last week in front of my parents for the first time. Today my brother told me my parents were making fun of me behind my back to my brothers the day after. My parents said I looked funny and mocked my struggle to breathe. 


I really can’t wait for this miserable journey called life to be over."
2865,Does everyone really matter?,"I hear this a lot, but don't believe it rings true for me honestly. It seems like platitude. Like, what if you found out I'm a horrible person?"
2866,Just forget about me,"I'm a failure in everything I do.  I won't make you proud. I won't make you laugh. Everything I touch will get hurt or ruined advensly. I broke my own familly appart. I'm a horrible son. I'm nothing more, then a useless person. Just forget about me, its better this way....."
2867,Why can’t I fit in?,"Just feeling very empty right now. The last year I’ve struggled to leave the house and I’ve just recently found myself a girlfriend, someone I’ve known for a while through work and we’ve decided to give it a go. Been dating for a month and tonight I met her mum and little brother. My anxiety locked me in a fucking mental cage and toyed with me the whole night. The whole car ride home all I could think about is this is why I haven’t left my home. No matter how much I try to put myself out there and be a nice, confident person, I just crumble. She was probably so embarrassed of me because she’s such an extroverted person and I’m just not. We got home, had a bit of pillow talking, and she makes a comment about how ive got no friends, I don’t think it was intentionally suppose to be offensive but it’s just one of my biggest insecurities, that I have no deep friendships and it just broke me. I sent her home and now I’m crying in my dark room writing this. I don’t know if I can keep pretending that I’m someone else, I think she deserves more and I really don’t deserve anyone. Being like this has made me very toxic and I really don’t want to ruin or change her."
2868,I finally grew the balls to go see a doctor!,"I know it’s nothing special but I’m a little proud...

To make a long story short, I’ve been feeling depressed for over a year and a half now and my family started to see it in my character. I was changing as a person. My mother convinced me to go and seek help in the form of a counsellor, who got me to complete a quiz which made me discover I have ratings of severe anxiety and depression. She recommended  I go see a doctor and I did. 

The doctors quiz revealed the same results, if not a little bit worse and she wrote me a script for medication. I have only just started taking it, and I know it will be a long road ahead but I’m happy I got the wheels in motion."
2869,How do you even find happiness as an adult!?,"I'm only a 16-year-old boy, but I have been getting constant anxiety about going to college and becoming an adult. If you are one, can you please tell me something good about being an adult.

I keep on thinking that being an adult means you can never have free time again. Mean you will be working 100% of the time... please someone tell me it's not true"
2870,My dream was better than reality and i want to go back,Last night i (16M) had a dream so magical. And i think i was finally in love with someone. I was worth so much in that dream. But when i woke up that smile quickly faded. I woke up in my broken bed with a broken heart in a broken life. I just want to go back and never return.
2871,"With the holidays coming up, anyone feel a bit more depressed?","Honestly I’m just happy to be with my family after a fucking wild year. I don’t care about gifts and honestly battling with bipolar, depression, and anxiety each and everyday is hard. Some days I get upset that I don’t have that special girl to spend the holidays with, or the many friends going out and having fun. But hey that’s my life I guess. Wishing everyone to find your glimpses of happiness here and there."
2872,I don't know anymore...i just hate living so much at this point.,"It's just getting worse, I'd be happy if it all just ended already.

I'd die knowing i was always alone, that i had no idea what it was like to hug someone, or be loved by someone, to be held by someone...but as much as it would hurt dying without those experiences, I'd honestly be happy...

Nobody will see this, and this really won't help anything, it's just a whisper in this bottomline void I'm stuck in.

I'm not suicidal, i don't self harm, but suicide is seemingly nicer and nicer...

I just don't want to live anymore, please end it already.
PLEASE!"
2873,My mums kinda autistic,Like sometimes shes acting all nice and stuff and then she's threatening to kill me like wtf I can do that myself and then she gets all pissy
2874,IM SO FUCKING SADD,and the worst part is that i know that i’m sad but i don’t know why i’m sad but then the brain says no no it’s normal to be sad so you’re just like okay guess we gotta be sad rn FUCK
2875,I feel inadequate and I'm failing at life.,"I've always been held to a high standard when I was growing up; a standard I've never quite been able to live up to. A few heinous things have happened in my life that have cause me to grow into a generally cold person. I hold everyone at arm's length even though I desperately need the emotional warmth of another person. I feel like I'm failing in every aspect of my life because of the way my personality ended up developing. What's worse is that my parents and husband frequently remind me that I'm failing in some way or that im not living up to expectations no matter how hard I try. The only person who doesn't seem to see me in this light is my daughter, but I feel like I'm failing as a mother because I don't know what I'm doing. My examples of a parent weren't the best and all I know is that I don't want to raise her the way they raised me. Sorry if this post is a bit ranty, I'm not good at self expression as this level of vulnerability makes me anxious."
2876,I sucked off a homeless man.,"Okay, so I actually didn't. I want attention and I am shameless. I wish people could understand that even though you CAN get better with therapy, dying is way quicker and I am too lazy and exhausted to do all this work when I am an insignificant part of society as a whole."
2878,I’m so tired.,"Nobody knows what’s going on currently, how bad I’ve gotten, except my boyfriend. I see him everyday, he see’s when I cry, waits for me at my therapy sessions, and sometimes I vent to him, but I keep most things to myself. My mom doesn’t know. Best friends don’t know. 

One of my closest friends that knows that I’ve been struggling for awhile now doesn’t bother to check up on me. Even if she did I don’t think I would even be honest with her.

They all deserve someone better. Happier. Confident. Outgoing. Someone that’s not me.

I’m lucky to have such a supportive &amp; patient boyfriend but I can’t help but feel like he’d be better off without me. I so badly wish I can disappear &amp; take the memory of my existence with me."
2879,i tried to kill myself (?),it seems like the smallest things tend to push me further into my spiral rn. felt upset that I was jealous of a richer friend's life and that I couldn't be like her in any way. had a breakdown and started sobbing and I pushed my face into the sofa where I couldn't breathe and at that moment I just wanted to die so bad so that I wouldn't have to deal with any feelings. I was like that for a while but a deep fear overcame me and I pulled up and started crying even harder because I didn't know what to do. been crying for the past while and am on the floor and I feel so helpless
2880,The reason you are depressed,"Is the root cause of anxiety the fear of dying? Seen a few articles &amp; videos like the one below that talk about how the fear of death is what causes anxiety and depression. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-5Ke2V9Jlc&amp;t=9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-5Ke2V9Jlc&amp;t=9s)

After seeing these type of videos, I was interested in what everyone else's thoughts are on this?"
2881,I’ve never felt so alone,"New subscriber, don’t know what rules are in effect, if I get removed, well I guess I’ll see you guys some other time in some other place. 

(Background) I’m a 32 tear old single dad. My ex wife has no empathy for the things I had to deal with growing up, not because she’s an uncaring person, but because she’s had her own trauma. As things were, we were relatively amicable, though I find her to be incredibly frustrating more often than not. 

November 2019 was literally the hardest time of my life. I took a severe spinal injury at work and have been left barely able to walk. I’m receiving workman’s comp benefits but it’s definitely not enough to keep up with my bills, and I’m also supporting my two year old daughter (light of my life, only thing keeping me together) half time. Cash is rough, I’m doing what I can.

Three days after my injury, I’ve been declared unfit to work, everything’s up in the air. I go to my weekly game night with a group of my oldest friends. It’s really the only outlet I have. Due to my job, I’ve kind of had to cut back on my social interactions because it’s an “always on call, and we’re not paying you extra for that” situation. Normally we play D&amp;D, sometimes we just dick around and hangout. One of my closest friends since 2007 ODs on heroin. The rest of this friend group is clean, literally the worst anyone else has done is smoke pot, and not regularly. We’ll call the ODing friend J. J is all over the place, half passing out, and it takes a few of us to get him able to sit and stay coherent for even a minute. Absolutely terrifying. I get a hold of J’s longtime girlfriend, take him home, and J’s Girlfriend and I stage an intervention. The next day, we put him into rehab. 

And my GF of quite a while breaks up with me. “It shouldn’t have been my problem. His family should have handled it. I needed to be recovering. I wouldn’t have had this problem if it weren’t for my stupid game night. You didn’t show me this kind of worry when I tried to kill myself when we weren’t together and I didn’t tell you about it until months after the fact.”

It’s not just me, and this is totally fucked up right? She was right though: no, it shouldn’t have been my problem. J doesn’t have family within 3 hours, though. J didn’t have anyone but his girlfriend and I. I’m not going to abandon someone when they need me. 

I can barely walk. J is doing great since he got discharged, blowing off people he would’ve gotten pills from, striking up genuine relationships with his counselors, and making an active effort to better his life. I can’t begin to tell you how proud of him I am. He is once again the person I became friends with. 

I have innumerable other issues, stemming from childhood abandonment and physical and sexual abuse, but I’m trying to make my life better. I’m trying to be strong, and good, and give my daughter all of the things that were denied to me as a kid. 

My ex wife is overstepping boundaries by going to visit the father that abandoned me when I was a kid, whom I have since reconciled with but have had an incredibly strained relationship with since. While it seems like she may be pushing for a reconciliation, she also will NOT be alone with me, instead opting to invite her best (and possibly only) friend to every interaction we may have, even when I specifically try to define something as “family time.” I can barely leave my house due to my injuries, and I feel as if it reflects on me that I am a bad father when I am physically unable to do much more than microwave dinner and put on the TV and snuggle with my kid. I desperately want to talk to my now-ex girlfriend to let her know that “hey, you were right, my family is acting super shady and trying to involve my ex in stuff.” Even though we split up over me (probably over)extending myself to help J. I can’t keep up with my bills, and I have few people to lean on. 

I don’t really know what else to say. There are details I’ve left out. If you’re curious, feel free to message me. At no point have I ever been physically abusive to anyone, and I try to make an effort to be understanding in all cases. I just really need help, and to be quite frank, I need an anonymous internet message board to dump to out of the hope that someone, somewhere will listen to me and validate me and say “hey, you’re doing great, and you’re a good person.”

I just feel so alone in trying to be good in a really bad fucked up world."
2882,I got screwed by others and screwed myself,"As long as there is smokes and alcohol, I am okay I think. I am looking for a job to be a dishwasher or at CVS/Walgreens cashier, it's been four days since I've applied. Unemployment is literally killing me. I dont have purpose to continue, I am very paranoid, anxious and depressed. I am very scared of the psych ward and hospitals, I cannot see myself taking pills to ease my suffering. My siblings are on medication/therapy and I refuse to be like them...

I smashed my hard drives for my computer because I was going to kill myself but I never had the means and clearly not the will. So I have no computer, just this phone here. I can only use it when it's charged, and cant use it when it's charging. I am 20k in debt, everything little thing takes work, I have very noticeable eye shadows. My father gives my sister money to food shop but they never buy for me. My sister, brother and mother are very crazy and I think they are out to get me. My father obviously regrets having children, and he is upset with me of course.

I am scared and sad everyday. I am trying to get away but I must live here since I have no where else to go until I fix my debt/life but even then I don't ever see myself being happy. 

Life is so painful."
2883,"Yesterday was rough, but the future is hopeless i feel.",Yesterday my ex wife came over. She held me and even teased me a little then left with more of her stuff. Already struggling with depression and that just sent me so low. Meant to go to work Xmas party but told coworkers I wasn't coming and why. Cried all afternoon then went got the sleeping pills and prepare to down a few and thought about doing a exit bag. No one cared or checked in on me. I didn't get to it but fell asleep. Now all I'm face is ridicule for not turning up to the party tomorrow. What hope do I have ? A 36 year old divorced male with depression. No one will ever want that. I'm so alone....and that causes so much pain.
2884,must be nice,"to have a support system of friends and a social circle that cares about your well being

maybe no one asks how I am because they 1. assume I'm fine or 2. just don't give a shit or 3. I have isolated myself and never initiated hang outs so many times I just disappear from people's mental spaces"
2885,What should you do if a friend has become very withdrawn and down?,"I don't know what to do for the best, leave them alone and give them some space or leave a message every few days or something. What do you guys think? I don't know much about depression, and I don't want to overwhelm them"

I am scared and sad everyday. I am trying to get away but I must live here since I have no where else to go until I fix my debt/life but even then I don't ever see myself being happy. 

Life is so painful."
2887,It's so weird observing my mental decline.,"I've been through a bunch of stuff the past half year, and I think everything has started to really take its toll. I'm in this downward spiral and it's surreal watching everything fall apart. My depression has really gotten bad, but not in just being sadder more often, but just more intense and full of dread. I truly have lost all hope. I feel like a character in a movie, watching all this happen. Just so weird."
2888,I keep lying to myself.,"About suicide not being an option. That it’d be easier to just be dead. I can’t imagine growing old. I can’t imagine everyone dying before me. I think I was put on this earth just to die. The more I use humor, the darker my mind gets. I don’t want anyone to ever, ever, ever feel the way that I do. My lows are so low. My highs are barely high. I feel like I’m constantly dreaming but also on a boat that is sinking. I’m either binge eating or not eating at all. I can’t commit to anyone because I’m terrified and my brain won’t let me come back to earth. In a way, I suppose I’ve already died. I think I will be alone forever in the depths of this dark despair."
2889,debt is killing me,All I want for my birthday is to be debt free or to cover the $171 I owe to PayPal that’s eating me alive so bad I stay awake every night
2890,Downhill,"I'm 18 and life's pretty chill for now, but honestly, everyday, I kind of feel like I am finding less and less reasons to live. Right now I'm pretty unmotivated and too lazy to fix myself up and I can only imagine how less I'll care myself for in the future. 

I'm dumb, I don't have any talents, I don't feel like anybody likes me. Nowadays, I'd rather be alone because I feel like I'm just a burden when I'm with my friends and family.

I just hope that in the future, I'll just be laughing myself off for posting this and be punching myself up for feeling like this. But right now, I'm simply uncertain that'll happen."
2891,Does anyone feel guilty when you are happy?,"Or is it just me?

Everytime I feel happy, I remember:

*""you don't deserve this?"" ; ""you are a piece of shit!"" ; ""your girlfriend deserves better than you."" ;  ""you are disgusting. You should just kill yourself""*

I just want to feel good enough to live... I want to be with my girlfriend and marry her someday. But I hate myself... I can't bear to live another day..."
2892,50% depressed 50% happy,"I don’t know if anyone else gets this from depression, but I’ve been feeling down for the last 3 weeks but more recently I’ve been feeling like it’s been 50/50 

50% of my time I’ve been doing things I normally do throughout my day to day life, like college work, going to work. I’ve even been watching YouTube and Netflix and hanging out with my family. I don’t feel like I enjoyed theses events when looking back but I do feel like I had a great time when they where happening. 

But then the other 50% of my mind is lost and struggles to find excitement in normal things anymore, like I don’t really have the urge to talk to my brother about things I’ve seen or learnt anymore. 

I feel like this depressive mindset has been getting better, either that or I’m better at hiding things that I start to not worry about those things, probably what started this 50/50 depressive/self motivation. This has started to feel like I’m not paying attention to things as much as I use to, like I recently watched a brand new tv show because I liked the look of it, but i found it difficult to follow and more difficult to remember what happened in the series. 

I don’t think I’m a negative person so I think this 50/50 thing , as it feels in my head, is like a battle between my positive mind and my negative mind. 

Now that I think of it I feel like I’m not talking to people as much as I use to, but I’m still trying to stay in contact so that I don’t loose anything so, I’m still in contact with people but I don’t feel the joy I did before, but I still find them funny and happy whenever I talk to them. 

I hope someone could spread some light on this 
I feel like this could be good for me to post, so 👏🏻 
I should feel proud of this post"
2893,Can someone just say something nice,I'm having a terrible day and some really dark thoughts and don't really have anyone to talk to so if some of you have the time can you please just say something nice to keep me going? Thank you so much!
2897,"As an African born Male, being ""depressed"" is like a vegetarian wearing leather. Its unheard of.","     It's sad because we desensitize ourselves from the thought of not feeling adequate. We learn that hard work brings success and with success comes happiness. But we aren't taught on how to handle failure. How to handle our emotions when things fall apart. How to reach out to, and talk to someone about the thoughts that swirl in our minds. 
     Ever since we moved to the states, my mental state has just been continuously deteriorating. And I can't put the blame on anyone else but myself. I was and ironically still am the type of person to always put the emotions of my peers before mine. I'd crack jokes, check on people and go out of my way to make sure everyone was ok. When asked if I was I'd always answer with ""always am"" or ""no need to worry"" with that smile across my face. I'd have a hard time talking to people. 
     Years after years I just kept declining. After getting out of a 4 year relationship with someone with whome I was willing to settle down with I felt like all hope was lost. I lost faith in myself, I lost hope but most of all i lost faith in God and my religion. I remember I would always fade into my mind and just beg for a sign that things would look up or for guidance and I would curse at God for not helping me and I felt abandoned. It got to the point where I began to have those thoughts. I would cry and think and question myself, life, my faith. I would ask myself why I was put on this earth. As a symbol of failure? A mockery? What with did I have? What was the point. And I acted upon my thoughts. Thric. To no avail. After the third time I felt lost. I didn't know what to do. I remember laying on the floor the night I attempted for the third time. I was going through my wallet to get all my items sorted after my passing and I found a picture of myself and my little sister. I looked happy and she looked happier. Her smile brought tears to my eyes. I felt a hint of hope. 
     If it weren't for her I wouldn't be here today, fighting to be a better me. If it weren't for here I wouldn't have met my fiance. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have been able to see her grow into the amazing person I know she will be and I wouldn't be able to help others who may face what I am facing and more."
2898,So tired of my existence.,"I work a corporate job in marketing that I don't like, and it's not like I can just walk away and find something else that I like as I studied business and I've known for long that I have no interest in anything business at all. The pay is low if you compare between countries but where I live it's alright although still not much. I don't even know what I get out of bed for every day... I just go to work till late, come back and scroll websites looking for movies/shows to watch and hardly ever find anything good. 
I don't like sports (dislike running, swimming is a so-so option), my only passion is in motorcycling (riding for leisure). Early this year a motorcycle caught my eye and I've brought this topic up with my mom before thinking and hoping she would support my decision to buy it (naive as I was) but got a super strong reaction from her and so I got scared and did nothing. I'm 24, I'm of legal age so it's not like I have to have her permission but however old I am or however far I live from her her strong objection is still a powerful deterrent and it haunts me. But I was determined to make it a reality so I took on 2 more side jobs on weekends (2 teaching jobs and 1 casual peddling job) cuz I thought I could justify to myself better if the bike money came out of other money instead of my regular salary although I could've afforded the bike in the first place without the side jobs. Fast forward a few months, I still have no passion that I can act upon, just going to work for nothing and come back home to nothing, I finally found a bike that I feel is ""the bike"". Super good bargain, great bike, it's the bike that I feel that if I miss it I will never have this chance again. I asked my sister if she'd support my decision so that I can at least have some peace in my heart and not just negative images and admonitions that are haunting me... she wasn't supportive at all. She told me to find another safer hobby but I don't want to settle with an ok, watered-down option as motorcycling has been the only thing I can see myself with... being depressed for so long  (still am) motorcycling is the only thing that awakens something in me... it's part of my identity.
At the same time I can't just buy it cuz although I live away from my parents (I live together with my sister) and they visit sometimes, I can't keep the bike at home and I can't find anywhere else to hide it (storage facilities in my country isn't as prevalent and accessible as in western countries, I found one but they prohibit vehicles/motorcycles storing). So now I'm standing here on a weekend peddling things (which I had set out to do in order to fund my dreams) yet it seems that while I am financially capable of pursuing it, the dream is drifting further and further away. I seriously can't stop thinking about motorcycles and especially *that* motorcycle, I don't know why I'm doing this and I don't know what to do. I feel like a walking corpse. I've long thought that it was alright if I didn't like my work life cuz I could at least have a life I like outside of work, but the fact is, I don't."
2899,Is it normal to start 300mg Wellbutrin without a week of 150mg?,I’m just worried/curious as everyone else seems to have started a week or so on 150mg first but I’ve been put on 300mg straight away. Thank you.
2900,Literally how is anyone happy?,"I drank the water, i took the shower and i hit the gym. What the fuck else i gotta do. i dont know how am not supposed to be miserable. im tired if i get no sleep and im tired if i sleep eight hours. i work 45 hours a week. i literally never see the sun anymore because i spend the entire day trapped in a box doing meaningless work. i dont see how a functional person would thrive in this setting. shit’s rigged, yo."

2902,What It's Like To Be An Economic Slave,"It's waking up at 6 am, never getting enough sleep

It's when you drag yourself to the bathroom trying not to collapse, and getting the first glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Realizing time and time again just how much you don't like yourself.

It's getting out of the house, leaving my apt when I don't want to. I want to stay inside away from other people besides my family

It's walking to the bus station it's butting into people so I make sure I get a seat on the bus, so I don't stand for a whole hour

It's getting to work, that's when the depression really settles in. When the clock hits 09:00 AM, that's when customers start calling. Thankless customers that yell and belittle you. Making you feel smaller than you already feel.

It's that piece of a shit coworker I hate her she always tries to make me look bad in front of my boss

It's having people hover over me making sure I'm not making any mistakes

It's having severe social anxiety and self-esteem issues, combined with having to be around ppl for 9 hours

It's being completely exhausted and having to make the journey back home

It's when I finally get home, and a huge thick grey cloud of depression and loneliness starts to take control. Sometimes I just sit there, staring at the wall. Crying.

Look at the clock. It's 20:00 PM.

Just notice when the day started, and when it ends.

14 Hours of torture.

Every day."
2903,Life is life.,"Today was closure. I liked someone for too long. Yet again I got swept away with too many dreams in my mind. Too much hope. Tonight I went to the Christmas party and now I know that, of course, they are taken. Why wouldn’t they be? They are gorgeous, funny, smart. They don’t want to be with anyone like me. Not in a million years. Now I can let go. It’s not going to happen. It’s never going to happen. Now I can move one. There’s only one thing though...

I don’t know what to move on to. Everyone liked is taken now. I’m 34. Going to be 35 soon. I’m lonely. The only friends I have are at work. I don’t usually see anyone outside of that. I go on dates and I’m sick of it. Sick of meeting strangers awkwardly feeling anxiety with and feeling no chemistry at all.

I’ve never really had a true relationship. I’ve never had anyone in my life I can say I’m really close to or that I can talk about deeper things with. I feel so out of place in this world. What am I doing wrong? Why is it so easy for everyone but me?

Anyways, getting home tonight has been rough. I’m sad. I expected exactly what I saw. I knew this would happen. But the real sting is just the realization that all my hopes just get crushed over and over and that I have no other options now. Like I’m back to square one and I have no idea what to do.

Mostly it just gives me an empty feeling. Like I don’t really have much to live for anymore.  I feel lost and forgotten about."
2904,Im still here.,"Ive been feeling like a piece of shit and that nobody even cares and that i’d be better off dead almost every day for the past year. It still continues. It (i might be depressed) has been heavily implied by a medical professional but never explicitly stated. And i just see all these normal people and i envy them. I want to be like them. Happy, knowing people care. There are voices telling me that im a failure, a fuck-up, a disappointment, that i’d be better off dead. I have seriously contemplated suicide but im still here. I have self harmed and im a day clean, at least. This is (for me) a major achievement. It’s hard, and not all people know that. Sometimes i want it all to stop. Life to stop. It’d all be so much easier. Everyone’d move on if they even did care. I got an app a while ago, and it really helped. Wattpad. There are people who care there. Im probably annoying you all but i needed to get this out there."
2905,I feel trapped in my own body and i can feel the urge to killmyself,"Nothing is going for me, i feel sad almost all the time. I just want to start cutting again and i feel myself burning inside. I need a release, i need to die or something. I can't live this way."
2906,Can somebody help me?,"I've had suicidal thoughts ever since I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14 years old (I turn 26 on the 30th this month). I feel like almost nothing has improved in my life either socially, professionally and all. I feel like I'm dissapointing my family everyday and my relationship with my boyfriend is starting to erode because according to him, this Just isn't real and need to try really hard to think positively. 


He was my rock and was trying to do everything better but I'm definitely falling behind and I feel like everything would be better if I just offed myself. I think about It hard and besides my family I don't think anyone would be too broken up about it, I've consistently fucked up all my relationships this way and can't take it anymore, I wish everything would stop and It would be easier but lately can't see through this. I feel ashamed and disgusted thinking about this but maybe it'll be for the better. 


If anyone could talk me out of this or has felt this way I'm here to listen. Thanks."
2907,Idk what happened,"I just turnt 21 and that is nothing special in Holland but I can remember when I got some sad and depressed feelings inside me when I was 13 and til half of November this year.. I had these feelings
That is 8 years and from a little help and some really big help ( I am talking about How much time and € I spend on a shrink) finally I am really f*ckin happy.  

It is the weirdest feeling but believe me we can al get better with the right “buttons’ pusht


And For real I want to help you all and I know i can’t but just say f*ck it and do whatever you want.
Go exploring Go traveling Go and live your life

I really found a lot of comfort in Kid Cudi (f*ck al the clout chasers using his name ) real fans would die for that kid tell em !

I’m from Holland and my english is not topnotch .


I really hope that everyone will die healthy and old

Boys and girls &amp; man and women"
2908,Really? Fucking really????,"Sorry this is a funny post



I went to my therapist for an appointment.  In the lobby they were playing Marley N Me.
In the lobby with shit ton of depressed people....

I caught the ending and they called me back. I had tears pouring. They asked if I needed to adjust my meds. I said No you need to stop playing depressing shit in the lobby lol

The therapist looked confused. I said y'all are playing Marley n Me out there lol

She face plamed and said ""who the shit decided that was ok?!"""
2909,I've already lost,"My best friend cheated on me and decided life without me was better. I crashed my car into a pole two months ago. I'm a shit developer. I'll never be able to repair the fact I was 390 pounds. I'm drunk in a bar again dying to just go home and hold someone again. Every day I do what I can to improve myself but it's clearly not worth it. I'm balding, I'm fat, I wasted my youth and everything I attempt is just a poor attempt at trying to make my life mean something. Too cowardly to kill myself not brave enough to change anything. My one hope is that my death will be a great loss; that I will actually have touched and improved the lives of those around me to a point that my demise will actually mean something but that's probablly just the latest in stupid ideas. I just wish I knew how to fix me. The world knows I'm broken, I just wish I knew what to fix."
2910,I have everything but I feel like I have nothing.,"Everything in my life is going ok, I have a girlfriend who means everything to me and it's going really well. I'm doing a course at university that I love and I have a job that I don't mind. Regardless of all of this, every Sunday, before the week starts, I feel awful, work terrifies me, I go and it's really not that bad but there's fear linked to everything I do. It's constant. Thoughts such as dying on my way and never seeing anyone again, I worry about getting trapped there, I worry about collapsing. All sorts. It's relentless, I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll feel so sad it's almost like I'm dead, I'll wake up in the night filled with dread and fear, thoughts that I'll go to hell, thoughts that I'll lose everything. I try to push through, I used to see finishing work and going everyday as winning but the days of this pain turned to weeks and weeks to months and I've realised there is no winning, I'm only losing, it's ruining my life and I don't know how to feel normal, I'm not sure if I've ever felt normal. My girlfriend is away now for a few weeks as she's finished uni and seeing her really helped me to get through these hard day's as I knew even at its worse I could go and see her and just have some time where I don't worry about anything, where I can just feel happy and safe. She's only a couple of hours away, so I can go and see her but with work and things we're both busy and she's only just gone back and I don't want to seem too clingy, especially since she'll be catching up with her friends and family. I want to give her some space. So, I'm on my own and I don't know how I'm going to get through this and I don't think there's anything anyone can do to help me, I just needed to write this because its crippling. Honestly, clueless. The fear genuinely takes my breath away, it's sharp and quick and it's very scary. With this stress i'm sure I'm going to die of a heart attack, my body is exhausted, mentally I'm exhausted. It makes me so angry, I have everything but I still feel like complete shit, constantly, what do I need to feel normal? When it's good, it's great, when it's bad, it's so awful and right now, I seem to be feeling awful a lot more than great. Fucking fed up with this shit"
2911,Depression treatments and my experience,"Sometimes it feels like I've been depressed since I can remember but I know that I've been conscious of my depression for 12 years (I'm 24). It was self diagnosed for a long time but in University I decided to actually talk about it. I went to the campus doctor and told them how I felt and for how long I've felt this way and was diagnosed with clinical depression.

Honestly it felt kinda validating. The doctor asked if I was open to antidepressants and I told him I wasn't (I know a lot about the side effects and was scared it would make my suicidal fantasy more stronger). He really pushed me to take them but after I said no he told me to regularly talk to the campus therapist, and I agreed.

My experience with the therapist was strange. I found it extremely difficult to open up and found myself leaving out a lot of things I just didn't want to say. Whole she told me some comping mechanism every time I would come to talk to her I had to remind her of who I was and then she'd skim my file before picking up where we left off. I found this to be extremely off putting and it made it even more difficult for me to open up. After a month or two I just stopped going. And went back to my regular routine of self treatment, mostly when I'm in an episode of manic depression I just cut myself off from people.

After that I visited the doctor again before I graduated for an unrelated reason and he asked me if I wanted to be prescribed antidepressant. I had refused once again as at the time I was managing pretty well. But I found it weird that it was being pushed on me. I have reservations as well as I find myself to be a deep thinker and a creative person, my depression has either been the source of the creativity or the the thing that strips me of that creativity.

I wanted to know if I made a good call not taking antidepressants?"
2912,"does anybody got even more depressed,when he sees other people happy all the time?","dont get me wrong,im not jealous or like anything,but like all of the time all of my classmates are happy,laughing,smiling,but where it comes to me? im just so fucking depressed,that i never smiled/laughed in these 3 years in college literally not once"
2913,Not heard from my bf with depression in days,It’s my birthday today and not heard from my boyfriend since Tuesday. He suffers from depression and said he needed space. What can I do? I’m trying to be strong but finding it so hard.
2914,Bye,I want to end it all
2915,Passively Suicidal,"I think im getting close. Tied a noose and put it over my head and tightened it. Flirt around with Death. See how it feels like to get choked by the rope.

Cross the road a little slowly hoping for a car to come out of nowhere.

Walk under a tree hoping a branch comes off and kills me.

Slip on wet ground and wished my head split open.

Just muttering these few words ""I want to die"", ""kill me already"" to myself, but go on with my life. 

Yeah I want to die. Its not like you give a shit. When you're like me realising how useless I am to myself, the fact that I cant make myself happy, I am my own prison.

Being useful to others only exacerbates the problem. I become even more enboldened to kill myself to spite other people.

No friends no family no girlfriend no pet no life no happiness no freedom

Just wished I lived in the US so i could get a gun to do it. too bad i live in this fucking shithole where you gotta be conscripted. fuck NS."
2916,When it's your birthday but...,"you realize that the friends you once had are gone because you ghosted and left them.



Why am I like this"
2917,Death is constantly on my mind,"There's not a day that goes by where I dont remind myself how fragile human lives are. Why the fuck am I trying to spook myself? 

There's been a couple break ins near where I live that happened like two weeks ago and since then I've sat in my room waiting to hear someone trying to kick down my back door. It's like I cant get a moment where I'm NOT fucking worried something is going to go down. 

I cant go into stores without having the thought of a shooting happening playing over and over in my head and nothing like that has EVER happened where I live so I have absolutely no reason to be worried about something like that.

I wish I wasn't so anxious all the time, I want to enjoy being outside again."
2918,"Struggling with my constantly shifting moods, I don't feel real half of the time.","Really struggling.

 I am going from bouncing off the walls one moment to being unable/unwilling to speak/smile. 

Currently in a low and my heart feels so heavy."
2919,My Endless Labyrinth.,"For me it's more like I never believed in a higher power till recently, I struggled through life for the ppl I love because In the back of my mind I took peace in the idea of the sweet sweet release of death, because I would cease. But now I have had my beliefs shifted, it kills me more I don't want to die to live eternally. I won't to not be. And now I have no peace, I used drugs for the longest, but got clean for those same loved ones. I'm stuck in a labyrinth that I can't ever escape. And its destroying me, I can't think straight any more. I just wish I had never been. But unfortunately Im here I can never know peace...."
2920,Scared of being lonely.,"I have never spoke out like this before and feel a little vulnerable doing so but here goes. I am a 45 yr old, single male, good job a house a car etc, but i have no friends. People at work think im funny and everyone gets along with me, but outside of my work i have no one. Its like im living 2 different lives, the happy fun guy at work and then this sad lonely loser in real life. I think its compounded with Christmas being around the corner and everyone has partners etc and they are all planning things, but for me, my Christmas day will just be me sitting alone, wishing it was all over for another year. Sorry for going on a bit, but i really do feel lonely and down and for some reason this year its hitting me harder than ever."
2921,Frustrated with husband,"I'm sad a lot obviously and my husband just gets annoyed with it. He doesnt help or care. Today was one of his ignore me for 6 hours to play video games with his terrible friends. This wouldn't be so bad if the time he spent with me he talked to me or something but he just sits in silence and ignores me, telling me hes irritated with me if I try to communicate with him. I just feel more defeated."
2922,i don’t want to be here,"i’m too weak to end my life but it’s only getting worse and worse. i’m positive that the only person that would miss me would be my dog,, and (possibly?)my parents.  my “friends” either hate me or couldn’t give two shits about me. i’m suffering with no one to pick me up, everyone is just moving on without me. i just want to take the meds that my doctor prescribed but my mom is convinced that i don’t need my medication, just some vitamin C and fucking omega-3. the world is getting worse and worse as the days go by agonizingly slow. i don’t have a future. god i wish i wasn’t such a coward. 
i’m most likely going to regret posting this in the morning- because right now i’m recovering from a 4am breakdown but i appreciate anyone who decided to read this far"
2923,Does anyone else feel this way?,"What am I supposed to do when life is meant to be shared, but it’s not worth sharing with anyone?
The problem is I have lots of surface level friends. I’m not particularly close to any of them, however. All of them already have their clicks, groups, best friends, or relationship that keeps them busy and happy. I don’t have anyone I talk to daily to share my day-to-day experiences with. I don’t have anyone to know on a deep, personal level. I feel so disconnected from genuine attachment."
2924,"""The right one will come along one day""","Whats the longest you've been single for? I'm rolling up on 6 years with no relationship other than the girl I was with in high school. It's depressing seeing people my age (24) in relationships and doing cute stuff, and I am just here feeling like I got left behind somehow... It's also doesn't help when everyone around you keeps telling you that the right one will come along but I can't help to think like, ""fuck you, I'm sorry I wasn't lucky enough to have the love of my life just fall out of the sky like you."" sigh..."
2925,Can’t sleep anymore all I do sit around and think of how my life went to a million pieces so fast,"Tired of staying up until 4:00, and not getting anywhere. I understand life has it’s ups and downs, but for this long? How the fuck am I suppose to get back to my old self I don’t even remember the slightest thing about that person."
2926,I don't know how to persist anymore,"This whole year has been a total disaster. I spent way too many hours playing video Games to not improve one bit. I made attempts to find someone who is close enough to share my feelings with. I dont feel comfortable telling my parents how I feel because their reaction would be catastrophic. I want to keep trying to find my niche skill but it's really hard to keep pushing and continue a determined mindset when you just don't see improvement. I've bombed out of my finals getting a horrendous score to finish highschool with. It probably seems like rambling nonsense at this point but I just want to be happy. I spend 70% of my day lying in bed doing absolutely nothing, if I get up I might just end up making a huge mistaking and breaking a cup and cutting my hand open (last week's episode featured this).

Please, I'm too shy to go out and find a girlfriend or just ask a girl out. If that doesn't seem to be the way, what other suggestions can you make to improve my quality of life?"
2927,Got meds today,I’m not really sure how to feel about all this. I never thought itd come to taking medication to even feel normal. If you could even call it that. I wish i didn’t feel so bad. But hey i guess here’s one for a step in the right direction. it’s nice to be able to talk to something. till next time.
2928,the only time I feel peace is when I'm asleep.,makes me contemplate going into a coma for the rest of my life so I can actually feel rested and finally feel complete for once in this god awful fucked up life.
2929,I don't have any friends left,"My friend group last year dissolved after my sister had a falling out with the group leader's sister

I am not on speaking terms with my sister for a different reason (2 days so far)

My only other friend is really, really distant and even though I tried to ask her what's going on, she acted like everything is fine

No one really likes me. They only tolerate me."
2930,I've written a thousand goodbye letters.,"Suicide thoughts are always in my mind, even when I'm not feeling depressed at all. I've never acted on them and I'm not sure I ever will, but since I was a teen I've written a lot of goodbye letters mostly for my parents, the boys I've loved, and the world in general.

Sometimes the thought of putting a bullet through my head comes to me like a crazy craving for a very specific food. That's the best way I can explain it.

I never sent any of those letters, some of them are lost, some or them are on a blog I don't remember the name, some of them are on the hidden notes of my phone. I don't know why but it make me feel better.

I already said I don't plan to act on killing myself, but it's nice to know that if I ever did, I wouldn't have to worry to write something to the people I care about."
2931,College has torn me apart,"I'm honestly not sure where to begin with this. I've been going to college since summer of 2016, and I don't have an AA yet. I had a good start, 2016 was a great year for me. Then 2017 was a terrible year for me, I failed a handful of classes that year. I still maintained my GPA and it didn't get lower than a 2.0. 2018 was the year I rebounded. I improved in classes as well as my GPA, and the Spring of 2019 was a good semester too, I only failed Chemistry 2, but passed it when I retook it next summer. But the next summer is when shit started to go downhill from here. I took a calculus course and I failed, it was hard, but I'm being honest, I failed because I was caught cheating on a test, I own up to it now and attended a seminar for redemption, but I also didn't do too well in my biology 2 lab, it was too fast paced, and I experienced a lot of difficulties in getting my lab report done in time, I'm a very slow writer. Anyways, the following semester, I retook those two classes, without any cheating, and I didn't pass. Every time I take a test, my mind draws a blank, which is why I've had temptations of cheating, but obviously didn't want to go through the same thing over again. Every semester, I'm always stressed because my sadness would often yell at me and threaten to kick me out of the house if I dont pass my classes, I honestly was not planning on having this happe to me. I'm freaking out because that's was my second attempt at taking those classes meaning that the third attempt, I have to pay out of state tuition, which is no big deal because there should be a fee waiver I'm able to submit. But what I'm freaking out about the oat was that I was placed on financial aid warning because in the semester, I had a higher fail pass ratio, I failed more classes than I passed. They paid for my fall semester, but since I blew it, I'm panicking. I don't know how my future will be. Ive definitely learned from my mistakes am doing feel like I'll do better next time but still, I failed, so I don't know if there will be a next time. I feel pretty lost right now. And Im scared, my dad has hit me numerous times in the past for not doing well in school. I changed majors, originally going for pharmacy, now changing into Information Technology. But I still need to get my AA in order to transfer schools and get my bachelors. Basically, because of this screw up and my situation, Im considering suicide, because I'm too scared to show my parents my grade, they always punish my in the worst ways. And in some cases, Ive even came close to getting kicked out. It's not my fault I suck at math. Trigonometry was easy, but calculus is a nightmare. And biology is super boring for me. I'm just scared, know what to do. My dad would probably force me to quit my job, but I actually love my job and it's helping me become more independent. Just give me some advice or some, thanks. My parents always find an excuse to why I didn't pass my classes. I don't watch tv as much as I used to. I don't listen to music as much as I used to. They won't let me use social media, so I virtually have no social life, and I don't play video games. This whole situation is stressing me out, and I hate to say it, but I'm a coward."
2932,Am I right to believe that I deserve the worst kind of pain?,"It's this lingering thing inside me, I just want to be given the pain and death I deserve. Life I'd already painful to deal with, as my constant self doubting nature and my constant stress about what I'm being judged for, and everyone just looking at me. I dont want to be seen. Why cant someone just do this to me, I should be dead already, or at least I should be beaten and held somewhere where I would eventually die. I'm a mistake in this world."
2933,Does anyone else hide their depression by putting up a fake face for most of the day?,"I have 3 close-ish friends, but I’m too scared to let any of them into my real self. I also try to juggle3 different friend groups, and I put up a different face for each of them. I’m so exhausted from it, and I’ve kept up this up for son long. I guess I’m just looking for someone else to know where I am.."
2934,Trying to get my self together after my world came crashing down...,"Hey guys so pretty much I’m making this post to really vent and say what’s going on and how I feel because I need to process this shit... if you read this all the way it’d mean the world to just comment something uplifting and ways that you’ve dealt with depression and how you’re coping.. cause literally shit hit the fan super hard...

So to begin I don’t think I’m normally this depressed, of course I hated my job like everyone else, of course life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, and of course there’s hella stress everywhere.... but recently it’s just been complete shit... and I don’t want to be depressed anymore.. it came about I would say like 1 month ago... maybe 2 months actually after I quit my job... I left my job because I heard of a better job opportunity from a friend. This opportunity consisted of me moving 12 hours away from home and working manual labor and what was supposed to be a better paying job than my shitty retail job. 

Long story short after I quit my full time job with benefits, and pursued that other job. I got screwed over and ended up working for 3 weeks with out getting paid from the other job. I had spent my own money living in motels being promised good pay for nothing.... I was fucked I had to find a job back home now.... upon returning home my dog who I’ve had for 13 years suddenly fell ill. My baby needed surgery so I got her surgery and it racked up another $2500 on top of my existing debt. After the surgery she was fine for about a week and then got very ill again couldn’t walk or eat and we ended up having to put her down... my depression sky rocketed about a week after when it all sunk in.. I smoked weed and had an extreme panic attack and haven’t really been the same since... I reached out for help from my home church I hopes of finding some kind of faith to pick me up... well upon returning to church one of my closest friends calls me and tells me she’s been having an affair with one of the head pastors whom I looked up too.... and this hit hard because in a moment of crisis you look towards people who you think are strong.... and the people I ran are all broken... I then found out that one of my best friends who I hooked up with another good friend of mine was being abused by the guy I hooked her up with which no one saw that coming... then I got super sick for a week straight and was out on my ass feeling like I was about to die... fast forward a month and I’m here today still just mentally exhausted emotionally exhausted... I’m scraping myself up off the floor to work again and I’m working with my dad doing basic construction. I just turned 24 and I feel like I’ve wasted the last 4 years of my life doing nothing....at this point in time I can’t see my self doing anything in the future... I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost 7 years now... and It hurts me to be with her feeling like I’m a failure... she loves me so much and tells me that I’m not a failure and that it will be ok and I want to believe her but it’s hard. I feel like I let my family down and her family down and myself down... but I’m tired. I’ve never been this low and I never want to feel so worthless ever again.. normally I’m upbeat and inspirational and people love me...

I have nothing but debt to show for the last 24 years of my life I dropped out of college, and just don’t have much direction in life... I need help.. Has anyone felt this low? 

I ruminate on old things. I feel inadequate and I stutter now when I say my name.. it’s hell to be honest. How can I regain confidence"
2935,Confused,I'm in this place right now where I'm not really sad or happy. I don't care about anything and all my stress is gone? Does anyone else get like this?
2936,"i have plans with a friend tomorrow (well, in ten hours) but i can’t sleep","i’m gonna talk about my appt. with my doctor at a later time. for now i’m just worrying because i don’t want my friend to see me like this

i’m a prisoner in my own mind. doctors orders though that i gotta get out and my friend cares for me so 

how the hell am i gonna get sleep"
2937,My story.,"i’m 20 years old, going to college in a small town away from home. i’ve been dealing with major depression the past year. i’ve been struggling to find help or a real solution. my friends know i’m struggling and try their best to help. however some days it doesn’t help at all. i’ve turned to drugs and alcohol to help distract myself and suppress my sadness every night. i keep a knife in my room and say it’s there for self defense but i only use it to cut. i almost killed my self a couple of weeks ago because i felt so unloved and imperfect. i put the knife to my neck and cried until i was too weak to hold myself up. as a guy it’s hard talking about this shit to anybody because who’s gonna love someone who’s so broken. i know i’m lucky and have so much going well in my life but why do i want everything to just stop? it’s nice finally finding a community knowing what i’m going through and i’m not in this alone."
2939,Heartache,My heart hurts real bad tonight. I’ve felt empty for sometime now but tonight I just got into some of my own thoughts and just broke it. It hurts so much now. I’m in this weird place where I have friends and family that care so much about me. But none of them are capable of filling this void I seem to have. I just want someone to ask me if I’m ok. But not just anyone. It’s all so dumb.
2940,Starting to put on weight again!!,"I’m really proud of myself and I just felt the need to share this. 
I’m a fairly small person (5,1 around 100-110 pounds when healthy) and recently because of my depression I lost a lot of weight. When I get sad I don’t see the point in eating and won’t eat for days. I lost around 15-20 pounds which is really noticeable on me as I’m tiny to begin with. I started to eat more and really push myself to put the weight back on and I’ve gained around 5-10 pounds so far. I’m really happy as I look much healthier already!! Please remember to eat something today even if it’s small and drink some water, you’ll feel much better trust me"
2941,Self-esteem,Anyone else feels they have to hide from the world because of their lack of self-confidence and self-esteem?
2942,Darkness,"I just can’t shake this feeling of dark cold emptiness, if I feel anything it’s just dark feelings I don’t know what to do, It feels like I’m in a bottomless pit, I have been having suicidal urges again, I just can’t bear this feeling any longer."
2943,Are these symptoms of depression/bipolar/anxiety? (not self diagnosing),"Hey. Just wanted to start off that i’m definitely not going to use the comments here as a self diagnosis. I’m considering going to see a therapist but i wanna make sure before i really do.

I had an anxiety attack once and i self harm roughly once a week, but i don’t consider that as depression. I SHed for a few months but only recently have i considered that i am actually depressed, because it’s only these few weeks when the following started:

- Isolating myself. I cut off contact with most of my friends and left my messages unread. It’s been roughly 1 month and a half. Whenever i think about talking to people, i feel dread. Not fear, just dread.
- Disaociation (?). This is not as strong but sometimes i just zone out. Could be just zoning out though
- I am frequently sad, especially in the mornings and nights. I suddenly have confidence for a few hours and i felt like i’m going to get all my shit together and reply people and do self care and work on my projects, then in the next few hours i suddenly feel like i can’t do anything again.
- I have always been insecure, but nowadays i always feel naked if my hair isn’t covering my face. During Black Friday i was walking towards a store when i suddenly turned around after thinking about how awkward it was for me to be shopping alone in front of others and walked away.
- I have little interest in most of my usual hobbies (unless when i’m in my confidence phase, i feel like i want to do it all). 
- I do my work really slowly. I also come home, eat and then just play games for the rest of the night before sleeping. I didn’t use to be a heavy gamer in the past.
- Even when i’ve has a good 7 hours sleep and 3 hours more in the afternoon, i still feel tired.

I just feel like i’m being lazy. I don’t feel as if it’s depression. I don’t think it’s serious enough. Should i just try and do better, or should i really go see a therapist?"
2944,About to turn 19 and I feel like i just want to die.,"Ok
 so im at a friend's party and I'm drunk as fuk I threw up like if was going out of fashion his parents are ashamed of me and so am I
I just fell like I want to end it, and I've been feeling like for. So long even when I'm not drunk but the only thing holding me down is the thought of my. Mom neon sad
Sorry. If I write like utter shit but I'm not right rn."
2945,Sad,"Today was an awful day. It’s my birthday and I turned 26 yrs. old. I don’t like aging. I worry everyday about the future. Not for myself but for my family. I don’t want them to get sick, I don’t want them to pass on due to age. I don’t want to ever face that kind of pain. It terrifies me. Anyway, today I had to put my beloved pet ferret to sleep and I’m heartbroken. I feel guilty and angry at myself for not being able keep her healthy. The vet said it was possibly cancer or enlarged pancreas about 3 wks. ago. She started having bouts of illness about a year or so into my time with her, but she always bounced back. Surgery was out of the question financially and the odds of her recovering was slim. Her small belly was swollen and she could barely walk today. She was eating very little and extremely thin. I knew the time was coming but I didn’t want to face the truth. She would attempt to play but due to weakness she would lay down every few mins. I hope I did the right thing. Anyway, I held her after they stuck her with a needle and injected the fatal dose. What saddens me the most is when the vet was doing it she wiggled around in her grip a bit and to me it felt like she was uncomfortable and maybe I shouldn’t have let it happen. I held her as she passed and it took a few mins. My mom and I cried together and talked about it to try and justify what had just happened. My mom is always so strong but during the car ride home, while holding a Tupperware container with her little body in my mom told me she felt like when our pets die she feels it’s punishment for not being there when her mother passed away when she was 16. I told her it wasn’t her fault and she was just a child. It hurt my heart. It makes me sad that she feels that way. When we made it home my dad dug a hole under our porch and I made a little tombstone. Some backstory, my little girl was given to me by my sister as a graduation gift. She only lived 3 1/2 yrs. It all hit me hard and I just can’t stop thinking about it. I can’t stop worrying. I can’t sleep. I pray she’s in a better place. A few hours later, I had a birthday dinner with my family and my husbands family and I tried to be in good spirits but I noticed myself getting irritable and sad and just not knowing how to feel. After the dinner I felt like I made everyone upset for not acting like myself and not coming across as thankful. I was very thankful but I don’t know if it came across that way.  I just don’t want anyone to be sad or upset with me or in general . I’d rather feel all the pain so no one else has to. I sit here worrying and I can’t sleep. I’m not asking for pity and I just there is someone that can tell me I did or did not do the right thing. If this post isn’t allowed here I understand. Thanks."
2946,It’s been one year since my suicide attempt,"I’m really happy and proud for being alive. I feel like I’ve grown so much from that day and from the days I spent in the hospital. I have everything I want and need in life and I couldn’t ask for anything better. 

Now that I think back on that day, I realize that I was acting out of impulse. My friends were leaving me on read and ignored my messages asking for help. I have better friends now but I don’t think that friends ignoring you for one evening should make you think about suicide. My then boyfriend also broke up with me about a week or two ago and I really relied on him to help me with coping with anxiety and depression. (There were many red flags when I was with him though. I don’t think I can list them all but here are some: he said he was single but I found out he was dating another girl when he started to date me; When asked why he was with me, he would say just because he thought I was hot). When he told me I was too annoying because I was always complaining about my issues to him, he said he was done with me. I was really heartbroken. I guess I just fall too hard lol. But I do believe that I have grown so much and I have finally gotten the support and help I need. I’m very glad to be alive and even though some days I still am very depressed, I have a net of friends and my parents who will be there to help and I know I’ll be okay. So, to whoever that reads this, I know that whatever situation you are in right now, things will get better. You are strong and you will be able to get out of whatever crappy situation you are in. 

Sorry if there are many grammatical errors and if the formatting is weird, I’m typing this on my phone and it’s currently 2am and I need sleep."
2947,Crave a hug so bad,I feel so fucking shit..... all I want is to just have someone hug me in there arms and let me cry on them. I crave a hug right now soooooo much
2948,I wrote this poem for a suicidal friend.," Trying to be strong when the world is collapsing around you... I know it's hard.

I’m not going to tell you to have a great day, or even a good day, instead I’m going to say: Have a day.  
Get through today and see what happens tomorrow.

It’s okay to feel like it’s all going wrong.

Try to smile and always remember that I love you, and I’m so proud of how far you’ve come.  
I'm always by your side! I will never leave you.

**You’ve got this**!

I don't know if it helped him, but I wanted to show him my support in  non-judgemental way."
2949,It was all seemingly going well finally...,"... and then I fucked it up. 

Last year was hellish. I stopped paying attention to classes the year before when I didn't know what or why I was doing anything in life, then I stopped going to some classes, and even took an important class off of my schedule with the purpose of taking it again during summer. 

Summer comes and I couldn't focus on it. I felt anxious just going to class and looking at the board, and I failed it again. Not wanting to tell anyone I just lied about it. 

Then I stopped going to college through the whole year and lied to my parents saying I wanted to change careers because that one wasn't what I wanted. It was my fault and I know it. Then I did actually change careers, and it was all going okay, I fucked up the first test, and then the second. Then I pulled an all-nighter and got a B on the third test, I felt like I could pass the class finally if I put more effort. 

Comes the final and I tried practicing for it through the weekend (Thursday-Monday). I kept doing other stuff feeling like I had time. Comes Sunday and I take my notes out and start going through some stuff, but then again stop because ""I have time"". Then Monday and I start studying right after waking up. I keep taking breaks and doing other things through the day. Until I finally start studying. I redo the problems from the first and second test, noticing all the mistakes I made and realizing how to solve the problems in the process, it wasn't that hard I thought. I redo the material that was left out for the supposed fourth test, and yeah I know how to do it.

I stayed all night awake, looking at the notes, going through problems, trying to memorize every formula I'll need. Then I go to the class and see my classmates going through things on the board and jump in, and I know how to do a lot of things there, kept getting anxious through the whole day. When the test finally starts I just don't know how to solve the problems, they're the hardest ones that I don't remember seeing anywhere. 

I needed a B on the final to get pass it with a C, and I'm not sure of what a D would do, but it feels like it'll be a miracle if I even make it to a D on the final and get a D for the semester. My college doesn't allow anyone to take a class more than three times, and this was the third. Every other college here is either too expensive, bad, and/or doesn't have what I want to study. 

I fucked it all up, it's all my fault, I should've spent more time on it, or started trying hard since the beginning of the semester and not nearing the end. Now I don't know what to do anymore. After an entire year of feeling lost and hopeless, I thought I had it finally, but no. I had to go and fuck it up one more time, because that's how I am.

I'm not even capable of crying, it just feels horrible. And I don't know what to do know."
2950,I can't do what I love the most,"Yeah, just as the title says it, I've been through some rough times, struggling with depression and my personal relationships and the cherry of the cake recently is that there's this hobby of mine which is my favorite thing in the world. But I can't do that anymore due to neurological damage... I'm physically unable to do it. Finding enjoyment in life is very difficult nowadays and it's making me question everything. I constantly ask myself why did this have to happen to me? And I just feel everything's unfair, at the same time I hate that I feel like I'm just complaining about everything and should be thankful for what I have but I simply can't.... There's some days I can't keep it together, today's one of those days."
2951,"Feeling empty all the time - don't want to do anything, not even eat","Hi everyone - I'm just looking for some advice here. Also posted this on r/mentalhealth 

I just feel so numb and empty all the time. It's not even sadness, just this crushing nothingness. It feels like someone has cut me open and gutted me so there's nothing left inside but a heavy fatigue that's settled into my bones. 

I don't find happiness in the things that used to make me happy - not even music (my favourite thing) makes me feel the same way it used to. I just feel empty. 

Next year is my final year of school and all my friends are excited to graduate but I'm dreading it because it means having to go to university and get a job and work just to make enough money to survive. It feels so hopeless and overwhelming. I feel sick thinking about it.

I don't even feel like eating. Eating feels like a chore to me - nothing tastes good or sounds appealing. I eat because I have to. 

Sorry for this rant - I just wanted to get it off my chest and ask if anyone had any advice. Thanks :)"
2952,"I can’t enjoy anything, I’m scared","Please, I need somebody to talk to for support. I used to talk to my ex for support all the time but it’s not healthy to do that anymore. I need close friends ASAP or I’ll lose my mind"
2953,Anyone feel hopeless and alone when it comes to relationships?,"When I like someone, they don't like me back.

When I put myself out there, I don't get reciprocation or the same feelings.

When I feel like I click with someone... They already have a boyfriend.

Fuck my life. I'm going to be fucking alone because no one likes me and I'm a fucking alien."
2954,i wish i had died a long time ago,"literally everything i do is wrong. and something is wrong with me because i try so fucking hard to do the right thing and make the right choices and do the right thing but it always blows up in my face. i try so hard to stay out of everyones way and everyones life and still i find a way to hurt other people or make their lives miserable somehow. 

i have no friends, i never really have. i have very little family and what i do have i just make their lives harder. i'm basically a shut in. there is nothing in my life that makes me happy and i genuinely can't find any meaning in my life. i've accomplished nothing and i don't think i ever will. i've never been loved and i doubt i ever will because all i do is make everyones lives worse. if anyone ever did love me i'd probably end up unintentionally ruining their life somehow anyway. 

last year i tried to kill myself but i didn't and i wish i had. there is nothing that has happened in the past year that has been worth living for. ironically enough this has been the worst year of my entire life. as if everything wasn't already bad everything got 1000x worse. i really just wish i could disappear, just vanish. because even if i am a burden to everyone i know, killing myself would, again, just make their lives harder. i'm so tired of being alive and i really just want everything to be over already."
2955,"I cried when doing dishes, doing laundry, in the shower and so on","For ten years I have been struggling with depression. My world was turned up side down in a blink of an eye. I was never prepared for what was awaiting me down the road.  
I loved cooking and making new recipes, I am a perfectionist, nothing in the house should be out of place. fast forward to ten years ago. I was completely useless like an idiot after I fell ill with depression. My house would stay messy for weeks. our kitchen sink loaded with dishes and we have to wash from the pile as we need dishes and put back to the pile after we are done.  
I cried so many times, in the shower in the laundry in the shower while doing dishes etc.   
Cleaning was the one thing that really cut me into pieces it was just too much plus cooking and laundry, ""someone please get me out of this world""  
I changed my medication 4 time and it took years to get a chance to see a psychiatrist after two weeks of suicidal episodes.  


It's been about 4 months now since I started to feel better for the first time. more than ten years of imprisonment in my body and mind. I'm striving hard to stay alive and to keep on living, but still sometimes I get that knock.   
mothers find it extremely hard I would image from my own experience. I very often think about others in my position and wondered how they're coping in a world that don't give much concern about this deadly illness.  


Don't give up. Start with loving your self and use your depression to remodel yourself there has to be something in it that can change your life for the best. I for one is on the way to discover the lesson behind my depression, what is the message I am missing? I spend lots of time trying to rediscover myself and to find my path to a world of wonders through my depression.   


Is it possible? I hope so."
2956,"I need help for my family, urgent, I dont know where to turn, severe mental breakdown of Mom and Sister, please help...","Ok, tonight has been heavy. I need someones advice on what to do. After a day together, my mom and sister got in a fight over something small like spilling ice cream, to almost a total breakdown. It was one of the scariest things I have experienced. 


Very long story short, my mom is a single mom, dad left years ago, and a lot of deep seated things within herself came up, inadequacy, self-doubt, core stuff, and she broke down into an almost childlike mindset, and my sister followed down that negative spiral. They were having some mother daughter differences, and tl:dr mother felt daughter is not appreciating everything she is given (normal teenage stuff) and she took one thing thr wrong way and everyone is feeling like they are the root of a problem. I know you arent therapists, but I dont know what to do in the meantime. Deep seated issues of not being worthy, not being respected, all tumbling down in a frightening crying fit.

I was able to calm them down, but now I am freaking out inside because I see the tremendous suffering going on in each of them and it hurts me. I calmed them down, but it was extremely deep down hellfire stuff. It scares me that my family is so torn apart by the divorce, and just seeing them in that state has jolted me into a strange state, like this is just a horror movie and will end tomorrow. But it is not, so I need to be strong for both of my family members.


My sister already sees a therapist, and my mom never has, but I am finding her one on monday morning. But how do I calm down right now? It is seriously really intense. 

My mom is the most loving, give her life for another, but I feel she is taking too much on her plate, and is overwhelmed. 


How do I prevent this downward spiral from happening again? I need them to feel good again. I need them to. I am not sure how much more pain can happen to a person before they shatter. Its like my sister will say something that cuts deeper than she could even imagine, then my mom responds and things get reinterpreted poorly and a meltdown pursues. This cannot happen again."
2957,I'm in so much pain,"I made a mistake yesterday, it made me sound very rude and hurt someone's feelings, I apologised and said that I was actually criticizing myself not the other person. They said it was fine but I hate myself so much. I made them feel bad and I can't forgive myself even though I didn't mean to, I'm so stupid, I wish I'd never speak again. It feels like I'm gonna throw up, I feel so heavy and my chest hurts. I've had this feeling before and I don't know how to get rid of it, it usually lasts weeks and the nausea comes back when I remember. Does anyone else get this ?"
2958,I can’t even look at myself in the mirror sometimes,"Sometimes i look at myself in the mirror &amp; i don’t recognize the person in the reflection. It hurts me to the core. I’m doing all the nessecary steps to make my life better &amp; I’m trying my best to better myself every day. I just some days can’t even stand the sight of myself. I can’t eat sometimes, when i do I’m immediately nauseated even after eating something small. Other times I’ll just binge eat like you wouldn’t believe.  I can’t be the only one who does this."
2959,Useless,"Most of my life people have told me I'm smart.  And they have no idea how wrong they've been.  I was never smart.  I was given countless opportunities and advantages.  Advantages that could make even the dumbest person seem smart.  And that's exactly what happened with me.  I slipped through the cracks, but in the opposite way.  I've continually failed upward.  And now that it's finally coming to light nobody can accept the truth but me.  I was always average.  At best.  Now I'll have to fail down to a job denying people insurance or something similarly depressing.  All that ""potential"" wasted ."
2960,Lights Out,"I’m so sad and I’ve been really sad for a while. No one cares about how I feel. When I put myself first, I’m just being selfish. And I’m too busy trying to please others in hopes they’d give me some light. I’ve lost motivation and getting excited with things I once enjoyed. I’ve become a slave to life. There hasn’t been a day where I haven’t thought about killing myself. The hesitation is getting weaker. It’s getting dark and I’m getting tired."
2961,Started cutting recently,"I used to not understand why people self harm but I gotta say, looking at the cuts now, it’s oddly soothing. I guess because I’ve always thought of myself as damaged goods and now I have visible proof of that. It feels right, and validating"
2962,Worst year of my life.,"This has been the worst year of my life, I got run over and I was left in a potato state for months. I had to learn how to do everything again. My mom got a heart attack, and both my grandparents ended up in the hospital. I know a lot of people have had worse years and I’m grateful we are all still here.But it just put me in the worst state I’ve been in and I can’t get out. I read old messages from last year and I look at old pictures and I see how happy I was. Nothing makes me happy now. I gave up all my goals and gained so much weight, I got distant from my girlfriend and from all my friends. I just recently realized how sad I’ve been and at this point i don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m depressed and I’m sorry to anyone I offend by posting this."
2963,I'm envious of people who discovered their dreams and passions at a young age. It's killing me inside.,"I'm currently 26, and just recently I've reflected on my life thus far, and how I've wasted most of it. Whenever people discover their passions for things it's usually during childhood or adolescence. And I'm not necessarily talking about career paths, though some of them discover that too. I'm talking about things that they are passionate about, their calling in life. It could be things like acting/drama, music, art, animation, football, martial arts, snowboarding, skateboarding, coding, etc. I on the other hand completely wasted my youth. I did a little cello as a child, but I was never really devoted to it, and pretty much stayed a beginner. I did some guitar as a teenager, but eventually fell out of that too. I did martial arts on and off, but never seriously dedicated myself to the craft. I pretty much remained at beginner/intermediate levels. I guess the only thing that I kind of got into in high school was archery. But even then, I never really became a marksman, and after I moved for community college, I pretty much stopped (I don't own a bow or arrows, so I couldn't anyway). As for acting, I've taken one improv course as a kid, but nothing ever came of it. And I've sparsely taken a few acting classes throughout college. But I never actively pursued acting. Oh, and about that, I'm still technically in college, but I'm on my last few units (that's a topic for another day). The main problem is that I've been unmotivated throughout most of my life. I've never been willing to take the extra steps, and I've always quit when things got hard or uncomfortable. And it's really impaired me as a person. At 26, most people are experts at something or another. They can call themselves something. But a very hard fact hit me like a brick to the face recently. I'm nothing. I'm literally nothing. I haven't mastered anything, I haven't developed any skills or passions. And now I worry that it might be too late.

This semester, I took a Theatre Appreciation course (to fulfill one of my degree requirements). Despite it being an ""appreciation course"" each group in the class did a performance at the end of the semester as our final. And that's where it hit me. I really want to get into acting. I should mention that I chose film/T.V. production as my major. I feel that it may have been the wrong path, as I'm not exactly interested in being a director (at least not yet). I primarily focused on screenwriting, cinematography, and editing throughout college. With my degree, I can at least make a living doing corporate videography for tech companies or something. But to me videography is more of means to make a living. I enjoy it, but it's not my main pattion. I had an interest in acting throughout college, but I never actively pursued it. I didn't get involved in any school productions, I didn't audition for any roles in school films or on backstage. But whenever I'm able to perform and become a different person, I really get into it and it really makes me happy. I've also started to teach myself piano (via keyboard), and I've developed a keen interest in music. I plan on dusting off my guitar and really dedicating myself to the instrument. I'm also getting back into martial arts, though mostly for myself (not to compete). I also plan to get back into archery. 

There's something inside me right now that I've never felt before. A sense of drive to really succeed at all of the things I'm interested in and give me joy. However, there is one sad fact that I have to swallow. Most of the people who've chosen to become actors or musicians (or even martial artists!) have dedicated most of their lives to their craft. What business do I, at 26, to claim to be a musician or an actor, when I haven't been actively involved in either growing up. I was never in any school productions, I never auditioned for any roles, I wasn't in bands in high school. I was a lazy, good for nothing, who was never happy. It pains me to know that there are people who know what they want to do or were heavily involved in activities growing up. Once they get to my age, they are equipped to have some sort of professional involvement. Yes they probably all have day jobs, but that's not the point. None of them started from the ground up at 26. At this point they probably all have day jobs while actively pursuing music/acting/whatever passions they have. Some might have already gone pro. My sister is 33 and is just about to go pro as a stage actress. However she's been involved in dancing, acting, and singing most of her life, like most people in the field. I'm happy for her, but it pains me to know that I've wasted my life. I know it's my fault for the situation I'm in right now, but I can't help feeling bitter and envious of all the people who knew what they wanted to do at a young age. I want those years back. If it is truly too late for me to pursue what I want, then there really is no point in me continuing to live. Everyday, the thought that I've somehow missed the boat causes me pain inside. I'm at a complete loss. On one hand I feel more motivation and drive to do what I want. On the other hand, I haven't devoted enough of my life what I'm currently passionate in. I literally feel like I'm being ripped in half by these two thoughts. I'm worried that I've missed my only chance to be happy. It pains me to see all of the artists, musicians, actors, gymnasts, race car drivers (not into race car driving but you get the picture), martial artists etc., who are all my age (or younger), who are all either professionals or have at least have advanced skills in their field. I feel where I'm at in terms of acting and music is where most people are at when they are like 12 or 13. Heck some 12 or 13 year olds are already ahead of me. But what can I do? The idea that it might be too late is too painful to bear. 

If it turns out that it is too late, I might just end it all and take my own life. Sometimes I feel tempted to cross that line. Better that then to deal with the lifetime of pain of knowing that it's too late to do what I want to. I've already had to deal with the pain of missing out on all the milestones most people experience such as dating, making lifelong friends, getting a license at 18, living the undergrad life (Having transferred at 25), having a youth, etc. I wasn't even able to meet the bare minimum of an average life growing up. Again that's another topic, but these things all add up. Some days I already feel like I'm dying inside.

If anyone has any advice please tell me. I feel really lost."
2964,Can’t do anything,"I lay here, in the same spot I’ve pretty much been for the past 2 weeks. I can’t do anything, I just have the tv on in the background while I stare at the ceiling, thought about suicide a lot but I’ll never do it and I’ll never entertain it past thoughts. My exams are in two days and I haven’t studied a minute for any of them and I’m so scared because I know I can’t say anything about it because come on, what kind of retard stares at the ceiling instead of studying."
2965,To Rachel and Nathaniel. 17F from Florida. Looking for people I lost after I left Psych Ward/Inpatient.,"FLORIDA between September-November
17F Alyssa


I gave Rach a sketch pad. She has Asianish eyes,  is a Virgo likes Black Sabbath, skates, and draws.
Nathan was like a younger brother to me. Clumsy, quiet, covered his mouth whenever he’d laugh, Libra, he had his birthday at the hospital. N and I are the same ethnicity. 

I don’t know if you two remember me, but I remember you guys and I miss you two a lot. I hope you’re doing alright, proud of you for being here. We’d play cards at night and chat about our day. I’d love to catch up with you two if you’ll have me.

I’ve posted this before, posting again hoping you’ll see it."
2966,"To my friend, M","You’re not gonna read this M. But I need to just say everything. Ever since you left school I’ve been broken and fucking hated everything. I never realised how much we meant to eachother really, until you told me that you cried because I didn’t say goodbye to you. And I’m so fucking sorry for it. 

When we met in year 8, it was because I wanted to meet the new kid. I don’t know why, I just volunteered to be your introduction to the school and everything. And straight away when I saw you in the main entrance there was just something that made me happy, because truly I hadn’t been before. Over that week you and I became friends, we bonded over our love for videogames, trampolining, memes, stupid stuff, but still there was something that made me feel so happy. And you were happy around me. People made fun of us and didn’t really like us too much but we didn’t care. Maybe it’s cuz we looked alike, or because we just got eachother so well, I’m not sure. You thought I was so cool, but deep down I thought you were much cooler, funnier, and better than me. 

So many memories together too. Sitting in the back of our classroom at lunch playing minecraft, messing around, looking at memes, laughing, just enjoying being together. You did say that you never met someone so much like yourself as I was. Everything is a blur now, because now all I remember is you telling us that you had to leave. I didn’t really react at all. Just bottled up how I felt deep down and completely blanked you, because it was easier. You were leaving, (permanently) anyway, so I just clawed you out of my head and emotions.

I’m so sorry. I should’ve been there for you when you left, but instead I wasn’t even in school that final day. I’m so sorry I can’t even tell you. I’m writing this because I saw a picture of you the other day and broke down looking at it. Because everything came flooding back. You were with me for a year, and I knew you were the person I wanted at least 100 years with. And then you left. And I didn’t even say goodbye for god sake. I should’ve been a better person and just hugged you and cried like everyone else did, but no, I had to be a cold hearted loser. I loved that year, and looking back you mean so much to me. Please, I don’t want to ruin what we have. I’ve ruined so much in the past with people, and I’m a terrible person for it. So I’m sorry for being so horrible and cold.

2967,Existential nihilism,"Im not diagnosed with depression, but i think I have it. I view life as a cycle and that it has no point. I came across several videos on YT about existential nihilism, the absurd and etc, and I think Im really gearing towards the suicide door. Everyday life proves to me that life is meaningless and pointless. Sometimes i would snap and burst into tears because I would remember that I don't wanna endure the cycle of living anymore. Also, as a coping mechanism, I would always want to keep myself busy, so I stay alive. I dont know."
2968,Loneliness,"So my roommates all left for Christmas break and I'm still here and I feel fucking lonely. I realize that this feeling of loneliness when other people move on in life is only going to get worse as I get older. I really thought that I enjoyed being alone and introverted, but I think it might just be some sort of defense mechanism or something. I'm terrified of being alone for the rest of my life."
2969,God isn't real,Religion is a man made story because people can't comprehend death so people make stories about a fictional after life
2970,Idk what to do,Sorry to be so blunt and i really have no idea why im saying this but there isn't anyone in my life that will listen but i just dont understand where my life has gone wrong with everyone i knew legit got no friends now everyone kinds just faded away and didnt want to talk to me im a very nice and caring and talkative person but seems like no one actually wants to be my friend or wanna actually talk to me dont do anything anymore on weekends because i have no idea how to make friends on my own im a really soical  person when you get me going but doesn't seem like anyone wants to actually get to know me or wants to know anything about me (pretty much be my friend ) idk if im repenting my self but ive gotten to the point where i think about killing my self everyday havent really had a friend or anyone for 2.5 years now as i always think i can stand in a soical place and not a single person will ever come to me but if i go up to someone they'll kinda talk to me but not much probably won't be here soon come up with a new way everyday but kinda planned out how im going to do to fml
2971,Lexapro no sex drive,"I started taking lexapro two days ago. My doctor prescribed be 10mg to start. Today after trying to get off numerous times I was unable to and i am scared that I am already losing my sex drive. 

Has anyone taken lexapro and regained their sex drive?"
2972,I generally feel like I’m living outside of myself,and the days past is me living my last days. I don’t feel like myself I haven’t in a while. I have tried to recover from my mistakes but I don’t believe I can. I appreciate all the things that has happened to up to this point it has taught me a lot about life. And how to appreciate it and God. If I believe in god and trust him you wonder why I’m suicidal? It’s because I just don’t want to do this anymore I can’t handle being depressed. I have made so many mistakes this past months that I feel that I can’t recover from it. I know that with God it’s possible but it not going to happen as quickly how I lost it. Also I don’t even know if I deserve it back. I’m tired of this battle I have with myself
2973,“It gets better” everyone tells me...,"And I kept trying I did... but now I’m at the point where I have no more personality, constantly tired, and no motivation.

Now I realize like how the world is split 50% between “good” and “evil” it seems that maybe only, sadly, 50% of us will ever get to experience the better part...

I was quite content with passing on at 40, but even now that seems like a struggle. I think 30 is enough for me now."
2974,goodbye (too long to read),"you are my brother not by blood but by life. you are the most important person in my life i would gladly give my life for you.

11 thats how old i was. a kid burdened by abuse who had shut down and kept to himself. but you came to MY door and saved MY life. i remeber stealing the copas and loosing half of them in the snowy field on the way back home. i remember stashing them outside before we went in. you were confused but i didnt want to get killed had to make sure the coast was clear y'know.

we laughed so hard that night i barely knew you and yet we laughed like we were catching up with eachother. 

i remember the bible after the monster left my home. i remember the wierd shit in that bible and i remember the dream we both had that night (really fucked) 

i remember high school i remember the friends we had and the experiences we shared i remember working out every day with you after school and work til like 2 in the morning (how the fuck did we go months on like four hours of sleep) 

i remember skateboarding with you and how bad i was at it but how fucking fun it was 

i remember what happened to your family im sorry no one could have prevented that shit 

i remember how i got off drugs and how fucking great it was to be with the bois again 

i forgot a whole lot but the emotions are a part of me forever 

i remember the pain i went through and the normal days chilling in ethans truck 

i remember my heart break (and just how much you did for me when i was suicidal) 

somewhere along the way everyone left to go do their things with thier people but we didnt we held true we are not friends we are brothers 

and although i will likely see you a few times a year i am losing you and although part of me is unscathed the other part is fucking shattered to its fucking core and is unsure what to do 

&amp;#x200B;

i love you bro good bye and good luck"

2976,Emotional Support/therapy animal,Does having an emotional support pet help? I want to get a dog but am afraid of losing him/her and coming out even worse than I was before
2977,I feel like the side character in a sitcom.,"Hear me out.  It feels like I’m a character who appears in the main characters lives.   I’m sometimes there, and I leave, and the audience doesn’t notice.  The main characters are always having fun and doing crazy things, and I’m just on the sidelines, waiting for my spinoff series.  That’s how my depression feels.  I feel alone, then people want to talk sometimes, I go, it goes ok, then I go home and cry and wait.  You know?"
2978,You know. .,"You know being a suicidal person or someone who has attempted it in the past is so fucking weird... like yesterday a cashier died who worked a local gas station, now I wasent friends with her but we talked a few times. Now the weird part of this is as soon as I heard about her death all I was thinking was ""lucky bitch"". Like wasn't sad was just disappointed it wasn't me."
2979,Just kill me already,Haven’t been on this sub for a while or Reddit in general for that matter but I just wanted to say that I just want to fucking die at this point like every night I have suicidal thoughts and once I was very close but I wish I had succeeded. I just don’t want to cause any problems for anyone anymore just end me now. That’s all I came here to say hope your guys days are going better than mine
2980,"What am I facing? I'm a 18 years old college student. I avoid social contact even with my roommate, I only play games, watch videos, porn, did very little social activity and I have a lot of assignments to do and I haven't started and I have to hand it out right next week.",i feel nothing though. empty. as if nothing is important and just couldn't do shit at all. no motivation.
2981,Christmas has to one of the most depressing times of the year,"During Christmas times your supposed to feel joy and be happy. Well I’m not. I cried over a Christmas ornament that my grandparents gave me when I was younger. When I saw my grandfathers name on the ornament it made me tear up. He died a couple years ago. For the past few years around this time is when I get most upset about the dumbest things. I only feel more alone when all my family is around because no one really notices me around this time. Then there’s exams at school that is a pass or fail the semester that stresses me out of the week (next week). I don’t know what to do as time goes on, Everything get worse. Especially around this time. Sorry I needed to get this all out"
2982,A People Pleaser With Depression,"The thing is, I am so mentally and physically exhausted every day of my life. The thought of leaving my house or even have anybody see me makes my skin crawl and makes me want to die more than usual…but every time somebody asks me to do something for them, or asks to hang out, I genuinely cannot help but say yes. It’s so mentally taxing. I know that it’s as easy as saying ‘no’, but I can never bring myself to and I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s anxiety? Is anybody else like this or am I just…weird"
2983,My lack luster experiences forever changed my philosophy and corroded my joy in the world,"Throughout my life I was never really sad beyond the normal once every week or so bummers that’s would come about. I genuinely enjoyed school, my teachers, my friends, outside activities.

My senior year of high school this lower classman who was hitting on me for the past couple of months (I can’t take a hint) asks me out. This became the leading joy in my life. We immediately hit it off, talking about everything for hours, never holding back because we wholeheartedly trusted each other. Every time I would have a tough time at school I would remember that I have a date with her over the weekend to look forward to, etc.

She turned my life from a normal and to be honest relatively unfulfilling life to something that made me happy all hours of the day.

 Because I was a senior I eventually graduated and went to a university not too far away but enough to be slightly annoying. But things were still doing really well with her. We spend loads of time over summer break and I’m able to make it through my new grueling college classes by thinking about the next weekend or break that I get to be with her.

The first semester finishes. Things are going well. We spend a lot of time over break, and eventually part again to start the next semester.

Communication is normal, but I get the feeling that something is not right. It’s March now, it’s been a long stretch and I haven’t seen her in two months but we text everyday and FaceTime every other. I mention her birthday and that I’m thinking about getting something really nice for her but she immediately gets very defensive about the idea of getting her a gift. Nothing so far in my life has set off more alarm bells in my head. I let the idea of a gift rest and we finish the convo. I have a panic attack for the next two hours and call back.

I tell her that I’m not doing so well because I have a weird feeling that she is going to break up with me.

She then proceeds to do exactly that. It was my fault that she broke up through the phone but it still wasn’t good. Her reasoning was very vacuous and imprecise. All I could manage to say after a minute of silence was,

“I respect your decision”

I kept this away from my best friend for a week, away from my family for a few more weeks, I didn’t want to be a burden. Nothing felt good anymore. There was nothing to look forward to. No times to cuddle and feel loved, nothing. All I had was hours upon hours of Multivariable Calc to do.

Her lack of a reason destroyed me on quiet nights. My head coming up with reason upon reason, some more plausible than others.

It wasn’t until 7 months of torture until I had a real conversation about it with one of my friends. One of the first things he mentions is, “Yeah I don’t know too much about you two but it was kinda shitty of her to get with **** immediately after you broke up”

The guy she constantly told me was no big deal, the man I jokingly acted jealous about. She had gotten with that guy most definitely any amount of months before she left me.

The person I trusted the most. The person that gave my life a meaning. The person I tried to make the happiest in the world. The only person to ever show me affection... decided that I wasn’t good enough.

I want so desperately to be able to have a trusting and loving relationship but I’m so unbelievably mentally destroyed by being cheated on (in my first relationship). Friends tell me I’m attractive, they meme about how I’m getting with everyone, they say “I’m such a nice and genuine and interesting person”

I rationalize that they must be lying because why else would no one approach me, why else would I feel so alone. I plaster on a happy face and when that sometimes fails I just say that I’m stressed.

Every day I wish that I hadn’t woken up, every day I wish I had never her."
2984,I broke down in traffic,"I try my best not to cry in public but yesterday i couldn't hold my teras back anymore while driving in the city. People were looking at me in disgust, i'm so fucking ashamed, that people had to see some guy cry alone in their car in traffic. I want this all to end, i can't take this loneliness and darkness much longer, everyday is hell. Holding back tears typing this. If only people could understand how utterly miserable life can be. fuck..."
2985,How can someone go through their entire life without being suicidal or wanting to kill themselves?,I just don’t understand how that’s possible.
2986,Someone to talk to,I really need someone to talk to. Please. I’m not expecting solutions to my problems. Just some way to express them. I’m just scared and alone.
2987,How do some people go through their **ENTIRE** life without having a suicidal thought?,I just don’t understand how that can be done.
2988,help,have a hole in my chest and i just wanna be told it’ll be okay
2989,The end,I don't know why i feel like this but cutting doesn't help any more I'm sorry
2990,Why me?,"I never really bothered to ask that question until now. Why fucking me?






How come the guy who always wants to work hard everyday, who relies on it so much, how come I don't get to work as much as I want to? Why me? I didn't hurt anyone. I didn't kill anybody. I don't vape, smoke, do drugs, have sex, or do stupid shit. I mean I'm a human being, I'm not perfect, I'm not a good person, but I'm not a bad person. I'm just a person in the world that wants to live his life, do what he loves, and not have to constantly live a life I'm escaping. A life where all I am outside of what I love is tired, lonely, angry, and depressed. I'm lonely. I'm not asking to take away from anyone. I do these things because I love to. Because it helps me keep the pain away, the demons. It's a healthy outlet that benefits me, it makes me better, inspires me to keep going. It allows me to let off steam. So why me? Why can't I get the one thing I desire most in the world? Why?"
2991,Is there a point to this?,Why am I still doing this instead of blowing all my money in one day and then killing myself? I don't have an answer anymore so why the fuck am I still here?
2992,I don't know if I can pay my rent,"I live alone with my 9 year old son since I split up with my wife. I found out that she had two affairs,  both of which were with 2 very close friends of mine. She left me £17000 in debt. I now work part time to look after my son, and I get Universal Credit. But because my work pay me 4 weekly instead of monthly, it looks to the government, that I get paid twice in one month. So now with Christmas here, I have run out of money, I can't afford my rent or bills, and my car is fucked. I really don't know what I can do. I lay in bed not really getting sleep rolling things over in my head. I'm not looking fir charity, I just need to get this out before I do something stupid"
2993,Why should I stay alive,"I always have these great dreams and imaginations about endless happiness in a different universe where I can be truly free
I don’t want to work for the rest of my life
I don’t even want to go to school 
What’s the point in staying alive if I’m not happy
This sounds selfish but at this point I’m already going to hell so what does it matter"
2994,"""It will get better""",Go fuck yourself
2996,I am not happy and it is all my fault,"I have messed up and I can feel my happiness slipping through my fingers. Over the course of 6 months I have not been truly happy and it’s all been my fault. First I became clingy with my gf making her and her friends hate me. I regret what I did and apologized a lot and they say it’s okay but I know they talk behind my back. Then, I thought I found the love of my life in October but she was my best friends ex. I made the very stupid decision to go for her even tho I still had feeling for me ex and that it was wrong to date her. People found out and made my best friend hate me and pretty much half the school. All I have is her but now that I think about it she’s not worth it. I’ve been disappointed with everything I’ve been doing, I plan too much in the future, I’ve made questionable actions like drugs. I don’t know what i want to do with my life and that is my biggest fear, not being happy and regretting all of my previous actions. Any advice ?"
2997,“It will all work out”,"I have never been more disgusted by a saying. Being told so many times a day by people that it will all work out in the end. Funny thing is that the only people telling me it will work out, are those lucky ones who have had their lives work out. All the psychologists, doctors, teachers, parents who keep repeating the same sentence of things will work out. it worked out for them, but what about the homeless person on the street who hardly has enough to eat, how about the alcoholic who spends all his money on booze just to not feel, how about the kid who just killed himself because his life didnt work out. You never hear “it dosent always work out” because the people who got the shit end of life arent in any position to be able to tell you that. Ive been through so many treatments and different attempts to fix me, but nothings worked. Im so tired of hearing half hearted bullshit answers from happy people."
2998,i dont know what to do,"i have been getting more and more depressed over the last couple of months to the point i often dont even do anything anymore , i know i should try to find a job , but i just dont even bother writing applications , for years i had gender dysphoria which keeps getting worse , but i get 0 help and i dont know what else i could do , at the very least , my depression also keeps me from doing anything stupid since i lack the energy for that 

i dont know what to do ,  i really want to avoid taking anti depressants ? i keep hearing of all the side effects they can have , and thats why for a long time i thought ""im rather depressed and stop enjoying everything i used to enjoy than taking medicine for idk how long and suffer side effects "" 

but its just useless , as long as im this depressed i wont have the money to just pay for good doctors when it comes to the gender dysphoria , and as long as i dont have money for that ( or money for a car so i can just easily be like ""even if i find a doctor in germany ( im in austria ) that would just be a couple of hours in the car , nothing to worry about "" ) 

i have seen it with my attempt to finish some schools and getting my A levels ( i think thats what Matura is called in english ) i am motivated until the first test where i get a bad grade and then i just dont bother at all , so i know any attempt to get a job wouldnt work 

it cant stay like this , i know that , but i dont know what other option there is anymore , i really dont want to take anti depressants but finding doctors who give you hormones is literally impossible 

maybe my only option in the end is to hope i die , i really feel like i have no will to live or energy left anymore"
2999,boyfriend’s parents make me want to kill myself,"they’ve been so judgmental of me since the beginning of our relationship, my boyfriend has always told me of the horrible things they say behind my back

they control their son with a gps tracker at 20 yrs old and treat him so horribly while trying to dictate everything he does and they were trying to control me too i just realize 

i most likely had a miscarriage but now they think i’m a liar for believing i’m pregnant and turning out my results were negative when i was under the impression for weeks i was going to kill a baby 

my mental health has declined over the past few weeks exponentially and i don’t know what to do

got kicked out of my house for getting positive home results a few weeks ago

dropped out of my two biggest classes because after his parents found out because i knew they were going to hound us into getting an abortion

even though i wanted to try to wait until after finals it all got fucked up

went to the clinic and everything with them and when things were being disputed with my medications and the results came out negative i panicked and started freaking out because i knew they would hate me more which they did

i tried to trust them and they just used it against me 

now they say they after they’ve learnt about my depression after they forced it out of me they fear that i’m crazy and a liar and might hurt their son 

i hate myself and want to kill myself i know what i know and this was real for me"
3000,Trying my best,"I’m trying my best to hang in there. 

Today was the supposed to be the day we got married 

We would’ve shared so many Laughs and smiles

Instead I’m sitting here drinking this bottle alone 

This cold dark night is calling me to an end 

I just wish you were here. 

Maybe I’ll take the final plunge tonight, either the liquor or an attempt, I’m not sure"
3001,I just don't know what to do now,"my only friends thinks that i'm faking my depression and anxhiety (i'm not officialy diagnosed) saying that i cannot have those since they have even worse problems and they say the know peeps with depression that didn't vent much like i did they called me an attention whore telling me that i just have to grow some balls and don't be a fake pussy even because i always act like i'm happy when i'm with them (i always put on a mask to fake out myself). meanwhile i live everyday with that think in my head and i always struggle to live normaly even before they called me like that i have realy often an anxhiety attack i'm not on some ad or similar and i don't have time for therapy and even cannot afford it there is no school consuelor in my school i stopped crying 3-4 years ago except when having a breakdown and i never allow myself to cry even by beating myself when i'm alone i got a lil problem of slef harming by beating myself and by strangling myself (for now i don't do it often but i think soon enough i'm gonna do it more often) i have even many suicide plans ready with a suicide letter that i'm gonna finish after this new year (date when i'm planning to end all this shit by killing myself) i'm struggling with all this shit for 7 years (except anxhiety attacks those are for 5 years) my parents wouldn't believe me too since i always mask up even to them so idk what to do

TLTR: 

My friends says that i'm faking depression ecc and calls e an attention whore

I never allow myself to cry(even by beating myself)

I got a lil problem with selfharming

I struggle with depression an anxhiety for 7 years(5 for anxhiety)

There is no school consuelor in my school and i can't do and get therapy because not time and money"
3002,"Lost everything, learnt a lesson, ready to fight back.","Hello eveyone. I am a long time lurker. This time I will share.

I am an addict with mental health issues.

I grow up in a strict unhappy family. I see now, both of my parents had depression and anxiety issues. My father slapped and insulted me everytime I acted like a child. I feel depressed as long as I remember. As I grow, I put distance between us to avoid bad memories.

But it didn't work.

I became addicted to alcohol and weed to be able to sleep, supress anxiety and feel warm again.

It made me worse.

I lost too much to my addictions. I made a fantasy world and live in it. Fuel it with alcohol, weed or whatever I have that day.

I didn't answer my phones. I didn't call anybody. I missed events with friends to smoke.

I lost academic performance, girl I loved, job opportunities, friends, relatives and respect.

Last week my managers offered me an opportunity that can have huge impact on my career and I missed the opportunity.

I had a panic attack in that meeting for the first time in my life. I lost control. I couldn't even remember details, I was so out of my mind.

I did not learn to face my feelings sober. I can not think straight due to all of that substances that made my soul and brain numb.

I lost the opportunity and this time it hit me hard. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. All I can do was beat myself, what an idiot I am.

Then I decided, I am done with this lifestyle.

I saw a doctor and diagnosed GAD, probably due to daily drinking and smoking weed.

Now I am a 27 years old guy who had pushed every good opportunity, loved ones away. I feel terible. All I feel is regret and sorrow.

But I learnt my lesson and I am one week sober. I will address my depression and anxiety sober and beat it.

I am facing with all the emotions, decisions and consequences I have been avoiding last 8 years.

I feel terrible. Sometimes, I feel suicidal. But I didn't drink. This time I know that drinking and smoking will numb the pain, I will be high and happy for several hours but I will wake up next morning with more anxiety, more regrets.

Now I am trying to find myself again. I am calling my family and friends again. Talking them openly about my situation, and apologize them. I am trying to surround myself with family and friends ınstead of drugs.

If you have any advice to help me, dont hold back I greatly need it."
3003,Anyone just hate those days where you wish it would have been better if you didn't wake up?,"This day has been complete shit. I can't fucking workout today and it's driving me nuts cause the last time I was able to was Thursday, which feels like a year ago, and it's fucking Sunday. I can't hop on and upload vids. So this day has been fucking useless, and I'm mad because I can't control the circumstances surrounding why I cannot workout. This is not fair. The Christmas Break is for grinding. I'm supposed to, and want to, fucking grind. People out here complaining about their work but one guy wants to work and he can't. I wish I didn't wake up today. I hate these days."
3005,Is there anyone here I can talk to?,I just need someone to talk to because I’m doing particularly badly right now. PM me if you want.
3006,Feeling lonely so I’m venting,"Oh no... I’m lonely... Not really... I have friends and talk to a lot of people, but as most of us know, people here don’t really feel great all the time... I used to have a girlfriend and we were on and off but she has a new boyfriend and I feel sucky about it... I met this really nice girl and told her I liked her but she has shown no signs of interest... We are still friends but for some reason I still really like her... I want someone that makes me feel good... feel special or wanted or needed even... Because right now I feel like I could not exist at all and people might ask where I went but no one would care if I disappeared... I want someone to give me meaning in life... I know I’m not the greatest at relationships, but I want someone to help me... 
(no I’m not asking for a date or anything lol I just need a place to vent)"
3007,Sad story: my crush likes me,My crush told me she also likes me and I thought it was a good thing at first but now as time goes on (2 days) I can’t stop overthinking and getting paranoid about things. Suicidal thoughts are happening more often Atleast 5x more frequently it seems I hate it so much. Anything good that happens to me ends up being a bad thing and when bad things happen to me I get mad at myself because it seems like only bad things happen or my plans fail. God I just hate everything.
3008,My drug abuse has left me isolated.,"When I was 11 I tried smoking weed. When I was 15 I was smoking blue OxyContin off of tinfoil. 

I had met a 24yo guy named Bob (real name cause fuck that dude) who was living w my best friend at the time (he was dating my best friend ((we’ll call him Trent)) sister’s best friend). Bob introduced me to a lot of shit; molly, pain killers, ecstasy, cocaine, and more. 

Trent was w me through all of this and although we haven’t spoken in a while I know that these events impacted his life heavily since conception. Things spiraled out of control when we tried to get molly from his moms new boyfriend and were unwittingly sold meth, which we got hooked on.

Fast forward a few years and I’m 18 selling drugs and living in a trap house with my new best friend (we’ll call him Monty). Monty and I were close as hell, and sold Xanax, cocaine, weed, and moon rocks (very potent molly) together. During this time I made many bad decisions.

I lied, stole, hurt, cheated, manipulated and pretty much every other shitty thing you can do.  This period of my life earned me a dui and 2 stays in jail (6 if you include overnights).

I’m 23 now and if you met me today you’d never guess any of this. 

I’ve changed for the better and I’m confident that I’m generally a good person these days. I always help those in need, am clean off all drugs (except occasional weed and I drink often to self medicate), I don’t break any laws and the people I meet fall in love with me.

I don’t know why I’m writing this... I guess because I’m not religious and this is some form of secular confession. But I’m sad. And lonely. I’m worried if people knew what I’ve done they couldn’t look at me the same, so I push them away. Every day there’s a devil on my right shoulder telling me I’m unworthy of love, but there’s no angel on my left.

Thanks to anyone who actually read the whole thing, I really appreciate it."
3009,I'm scared,"I don't know what kind of future I have... At 42 years old I'm finding life harder and harder to deal with. My depression and anxiety just keep getting worse and I don't know how to get better. I know I have a lot of crap that I need to heal from but I don't even know where to start. I've seen many therapists over the last 20 years we're so as well as been on many different medications. I'm just at a loss. The holidays make things even worse, I've been crying so much this past week. Really don't know how much longer I can go on like this. Any encouragement or ideas appreciated! Tia xo"
3010,I can't sleep and I'm miserable as usual.,"Often times when I can't sleep I just wish I had somebody in bad with me. Somebody I could just watch as they look so peaceful and innocent as they sleep. To listen to their breathing, maybe even playing my ear to their chest to hear their heartbeat and whatnot just to know I'm not alone. Someone who I can lay next to and watch YouTube as my insomnia gets the best of me, holding their hand as they slept soundly beside me. Who am I kidding, I do it every time I can't sleep. I just want to have somebody beside me during the tough times. I've been so stressed out lately that my eyes and other muscles in my body have been consistently twitching. I've been working my ass off to get people Christmas gifts, people that I doubt would even appreciate them anyways, but I want to be nice and show the few people in my life that I appreciate them even if the feeling isn't reciprocated. Every paycheck I get this month is going to Christmas. I might as well just take a goddamn lighter to my paychecks. It'd warrant similar results anyways. Christmas is such a goddamn stupid time of year. But I'll make a separate post about that tomorrow. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I'm really getting sick of it. Nothing I do feels worth it anymore. I don't feel loved. I don't feel appreciated. I don't feel like I'm needed. I feel like I could vanish right now and not a single ripple would occur in the world. I just wish somebody loved me in that special way that most people get to experience. I don't know. This was just a dumb rant that probably won't get much attention anyways, so I'm gonna try and get sleep. I'm sure it'll be in vain anyways, but what else am I gonna do? Cheers."
3011,I'm only alive right now because of my pride,"I'm not good enough. Not for people, not for jobs, not for anything. I never have been. I always try to do the right thing. Ya know, keep my word, make people happy, don't lie, always smile, lend a helping hand. All that's ever done for me is attract abusers and users. And I'm never enough. That's my life. I gave my word several years ago that I wouldn't kill myself until a certain time. That time is slowly approaching and I find myself counting the days and hours even though it's still a few years away. Every day hurts and the only thing keeping me from killing myself is because I gave my word. Unfortunately, it weighs on me more and more and I'm not really sure I can do that anymore. I always wanted to die with my pride intact but at this rate I'm going to go out with absolutely nothing.

I'm a big guy. Bald, pierced, tattooed, resting bitch face but always with a joke or something to make people laugh. I'm supposed to be tough. I'm supposed to protect people. I just can't. I've tried. I feel like I'm small and fragile. I cry all the time. Never in front of other people though, can't show weakness or I'm somehow a monstrosity.

I hate everything about my life and just want it to be over already."
3012,I just need someone to cuddle me and tell me everything is okay,My ptsd is kicking in hard tonight. I just want it to go away.😭😭😭
3013,I’m scared to ask for help because:,"1. I’m afraid I’ll lose my independence (I have a involuntary movement neurological health condition that started at 19 and just keeps getting worse. 25 now) 
2. I’m ashamed to admit how bad I’ve been doing
3. My pride doesn’t want me to tell people just so that they can give me sympathy which in the end won’t take away my challenges in the first place
4. I don’t want my friends and family to worry about me

But to be honest, it’s getting harder to keep myself together. Therapy is so expensive. I’m barely holding it down as it is... thinking of deleting all social media apps and even reddit? Worried I’ve been using them as a distraction for my pain along with food. Hopefully with those apps deleted I can at least just sit with my pain until I get the motivation to be productive with my life... thinking out loud... Giving up is not an option even though it feels like it is sometimes... 

Let’s fight on."
3014,The scariest part is I’m not even super sad... I’m just so tired of living,"I want to die, I really do. I’m not actively suicidal but I really just want life to be over. The only thing that’s keeping me here is FOMO from the short teases of happiness I’ve gotten in my life. I bring nothing of value to the world and I honestly feel like it’d be a favor to everyone I knew if I offend myself and they could just get past having to deal with me."
3015,I finally asked for help. I can't believe I just did that.,"After 7 years of trauma being so afraid of what my parents will think of me, my depression has gotten so d\*mn severe.

I finally asked for help, I did it. I asked to start cbt therapy.

I figured I would share this to the internet because this is huge for me. I finally did it, drenched in sweat and tears. I might finally get some help.

I've battled that fear for so long it feels like its been my entire life.

Anyone out there struggling with fear of parents judgement knows, and of course I want you to ask for help. &lt;3

Now I'm just positively hoping I can be saved! :)"
3016,can’t get over this depression episode,"everything keeps stacking up, wish i could be hugged or cared about for once. let me just hear once “it’ll be okay”"
3017,What's the point,What's the point in living what's the point in getting a hair cut what's the point in shaving what's the point in all of this
3018,"I feel down, need advice","I've just been really down and having suicidal thoughts after my grandma died in an accident.
We had a really close relationship, real family if you get me. Now there's nothing.
idk what to do and would really need some advice"
3019,Drowning,"I’ve finally stopped swimming and accepted what’s going to happen. I’ve let myself sink down and stop fighting. As much as I struggled with the thought of it before, it’ll never get better. It never has before, and it still won’t. I honestly don’t see a future for me that isn’t suicide. It’s not going to happen for a while, but that’s how I’ll die. I’d say I care but I honestly don’t feel anything anymore. I’m done resisting and having false hopes. I’m just waiting to stop breathing now."
3020,Sick of everything.,"My indecisiveness, my raging alcoholic/non empathic mother, my finances, this shitty depressing apartment, my anxiety stopping me from getting my license, the holidays, pressure to get my life together.. it never ends. I’m 27. I have a 3yr old daughter who I feel like I’m failing. I need to switch my depression meds. Effexor has done jack shit for me."
3021,I’ve done bad things in life and feel unworthy of love.,"When I was 11 I tried smoking weed. When I was 15 was smoking blue OxyContin off of tinfoil.

3022,I don't want my family to know that I'm depressed,"Hello everyone. I'm pretty new to all this so I'll do the best that I can to tell my story in a simple manner. Earlier this year, my father passed away in April due to heart failure. I was at work at the time and my little brother was the first one to discover the body. He called 911 and attempted CPR on my dad but wasn't able to revive him. I received numerous missed calls from my brother at work and luckily I was able to leave work early after explaining the situation to my manager. I drove to my house as fast as I could and the first thing I saw was a fire truck and several police cars surrounding my house. I ran only to be stopped by one of the paramedics and he told me that my father died. I was shocked but my biggest concern was my brother. As I walked up the stairs, a chill ran up my spine as my brother's cries became louder and louder. I hugged him but didn't utter a word. My mom was out of state but spread the news to all of my relatives. I remember calling my sister and the first thing I heard was, ""please tell me it's not true."" I was busy calming down my brother while being bombarded with questions from the police but only when I was alone did I actually cry. My brother is doing a lot better. He just turned 14 not too long ago and is participating in many after school clubs. I have been focusing on boosting my family's morale whenever I can, which included cooking and telling stupid jokes just to get a chuckle from my family.  I'm 23 now and work at a dead-end retail job that I have no problem quitting, but I just don't know what kind of job I'd like to do once I quit. I barely passed high school and didn't even bother finishing community college so I don't have anything good to put on my resume. I spend 40+ hours a week getting berated by customers only to get a small paycheck every other week and by the time I get back home, I'm exhausted and have no motivation to do anything. I don't know what I want to do in life and doing something as simple as playing videogames or watching tv as become a chore. Basically, I feel so empty on the inside and I only put a smile on my face when I'm with family just so that I don't feel like one extra burden for my family to bear. I feel like I'm being selfish, like I have no right to be sad right now, especially after all the things that my brother had to go through. I want to be there for my brother but I don't want him to know that the person he is looking up to, his carefree older brother, is just a fraud who is barely making ends meet with his crappy job and can't even decide his own future. Is there anyone else who feels something similar to this?"
3023,Can a crisis Hotline track your phone if you use Google Voice or any other way to spoof your phone number?,I was thinking of calling the crisis line but i don’t want them to be able to find me in any way.
3024,Cost of trintellix?,How much do you pay with insurance? My doctor just prescribed it to me but failed to mention there's no generic. So I have to meet a $700 deductible and even after that my cost will be $80 for a month supply. Definitely way out of my budget. Sucks cause I was looking forward to trying it.
3025,Does anyone feel happy and depressed at the same time?,"I have things I do that make me happy, but still there's always a lingering at the back of my mind that everything means nothing and that there's no point in being happy or doing anything which makes me suicidal. I wish things were like the way they used to be in the past where I was oblivious to everything so I could be happy without  these lingering thoughts."
3026,I hate it when depressed people aren’t taken seriously because they are “self-diagnosed”,"I was “self-diagnosed” for years until recently when I saw a doctor and therapist. I now know that I do indeed have depression, but for years I have been afraid of telling people because I didn’t want them to tell me I was just diagnosing myself. When a depressed person  is “self-diagnosed” they aren’t taken seriously because people believe they are just falsely diagnosing themselves for attention and sympathy. There are some people in the world that do that, but most depressed people couldn’t care less about seeking attention. All they want is your help and support. Yet all people that claim to have depression are just called attention seekers. Even people that ARE diagnosed are called attention seekers. Doesn’t make sense."
3027,12/14/19,"Im feeling alone, sad tired. I want her (my girlfriend) to ask how I'm doing. I don't want to see my father. I want to be with my brothers and sisters. I want someone to ask if I'm okay. I'm not okay. My dad called me and texted me today, I feel guilty that I didn't go with them. I feel guilty that I haven't seen my brothers and sisters in over a year. My mom asked me today if I wanted to invite my siblings to come with us to the store, I really wanted that but I couldn't do it. I didn't want to talk to my dad. She's (my girlfriend) at a party with some of my friends, she's probably drinking, she probably won't text me till tomorrow, that was the deal. She knows I don't drink, and that I don't like it when people I care about get drunk. I'm sorry if this isn't the place to put this and I'm not sure if I'm actually depressed. I've had a hard life but a lot of people's lives are worse, I'm grateful for my life and I try to focus on the good. But today, I just got low. I think"

3030,hate myself.,so depressed. hate myself so badly i isolate myself from everyone. i feel so helpless and numb to emotions and the world around me... like everything is and has been pointless for awhile. i broke my own heart and i can’t really fix it bc i’m stuck in me. if that makes sense. i only want to pursue some kind of genuine happiness in this life. i really do hate ducking everything. i’m disgusted with how unfair life is.
3031,"lost, alone, unhappy despite the success","honestly idk how to even organize my thoughts so sorry if this rant makes no sense.

i'm in my early 20's and on the surface am living a dream come true. i've always had a profound sense of direction about my goals. i've had an incredible start to a career doing something I love, making over half a million dollars a year, and am on a path to hit 7 figures in the coming years.  i workout and am very fit. i've received many compliments on my looks. i love my family and truly close friends. people admire me.

but i feel truly lonely. i am addicted to success but the more i achieve the more i realize it doesn't make me happy like i thought it would. it's an exhilarating journey which I've plowed through like a fuckin train all by myself. but when the going gets difficult it can be painful to power through by myself. i'd like to share this journey with someone special. i've met many girls but never anyone truly special - until recently. unfortunately things will likely never progress how i'd like. she's is in a great place in life and i'm truly happy for her.

i've gotten into a pattern of burying my pain by making more and more money. sitting here in my empty glass box at the top of the world playing through sad songs on spotify, time to cry myself to sleep"

3037,"I thought I get over melancholy, but it ended up I just become depressed and numbed","I used to cry myself to sleep at night to around 5\~7 years.  
Then I finally felt like ""I'm not doing this anymore, ""and I stopped crying at night for about seven years.  


But I felt those sad feelings are buried deep in my heart, rotting there with all my passion and good qualities and beliefs. I tried to stay calm and rational most of the time, but sometimes trivial things might trigger all the sad feelings, and then all the blames I have for myself floated to the surface again. I cry unexpectedly for movie scenes which are not so touching for me in the past. I cry after small conflicts to which I thought I have gotten used. However, I don't feel connected in real life, and I don't have the urged to connect to other people. I become numb to other people's feelings, saying something that I know I wouldn't have said in the past. I looked into myself: I become so cruel and cold, unrecognizable. It seems like the ""me"" in the past would be so surprised to meet who I am at present.  Nevertheless, I felt this is the only way to becoming stiff and avoiding getting hurt again. I was so tired of feeling sad and vulnerable. I am so sick of trying to be loved but getting abandoned and ignored. I am so tired of feeling a lack of value. I'm tired of myself imagining a funeral after my suicide when someone would finally care, and be frightened by the thought that perhaps no one would. I felt like I've lost all patience in my life and this world. Sometimes I want everyone to F\*\*k off.  


But yesterday, I cried myself to sleep again. After such a long time, I thought I had trained myself to feel nothing. I'm afraid that all those ghosts in the past won't stop haunting me.  I'll be trap in this damning crying-to-sleep whirl again."
3038,I feel like I’ve lived long enough,"I’m so tired of having depression, ocd, ptsd, anxiety.  There are people that love me, or at least they say and act like they do. But I can’t feel it. My mind won’t let me believe it. So I torture myself with scenarios of them abandoning me. I break my own damn heart again and again, daily. Things are getting worse, and after I thought I was long done with the worst of things. I thought I made it through my mental illness to the other side. I thought I finally found a sense of peace, but it’s been ripped away from me and I’ve been thrown into hell again. I’m so paranoid that my loved ones are lying to me, they don’t really want to be around me. It’s just pity. Sometimes I think I can only take so much heartache before breaking.  I’m already broken. I feel so disgusted with myself. I feel like such a burden. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been through suicide attempts before, and I still get ideation, but I just want to feel like myself again"
3040,I don't know why I'm crying anymore,"Everything is going great.

So why does it still hurt?

I just want it to stop hurting so bad"
3041,"I reached out for help today, you can too.","I’ve been suffering from mental health issues my entire life. Currently I’m 22 years old and when I got to college I picked up some terrible habits, only making my depression worse. I’m in my second to last semester currently and finals are next week. I’ve been lying to my parents about how school is going, saying my grades are fine and I’m in a good place almost every day. In reality, I’ve skipped more classes than I’ve attended, I smoke and drink every night, and don’t have a job. I fell into a hole of deep and dark despair and it seemed as if there would be only one easy way out of the hole. After contemplating ending my life for the past 3 days straight, I made the toughest decision in my life so far, I called my father and told him everything. If I had not made that phone call 3 hours ago, I would probably not be here any longer. I have a new treatment starting next week and will have to stay sober for now on. Just know that suicide is a permanent solution to problems that can be solved eventually if you address them and be honest. For anybody feeling lost tonight, please know that it’s never too late to tell a loved one that you need help."
3042,I wish I could disappear,"I wish I could run away, I wish I didn't had to deal with anything or anyone, I wish I could hide myself from the world, I wish I didn't have to speak to people. I just wish I was literally invisible to this shit society and system, and that I could live my life surrounded by nature."
3043,Suicide ideation question/ what makes a good councilor,"So,  I've been noticing that my depression and suicide ideation seriously spike after a particularly good day or event.  Does anyone know what may cause this? Also when looking for a councilor,  what helps you identify a good councilor? Ive had many,  but have not been particularly happy with them. What are you counseling sessions like in terms of format and communication style?"
3044,Friends in a state you didn't fully grow up in,Nothing like high school friends reminiscing about the good days to make you feel like shit. They seem to have done more in their live than I have.
3045,Am I depressed?,"I don’t want to self-diagnose myself but in these last 2 months i don’t feel as energetic as i used to be. I can’t focus on my studies, can’t focus on anything basically. I started to feel so sad as i started to feel lonely even though i got people around which i think they don’t really care about me. I feel like i’m a background character to everyone. I come home and do nothing but to lay on the bed. So what do you think this is? Is this some depression or some sadness era that will pass?"
3046,I fucking hate this.,"I hate being trapped inside this filthy, disgusting body. I hate going to bed alone. I hate waking up alone. I hate going through the days, trapped inside my own head. I hate my job. I hate my family. I hate myself. I resent those I care about, because they stop me from hanging myself. I resent myself, for the things I have done, and the things I will continue to do. I will make everyone around me hurt, and I will go on feeling sorry for myself despite that. Fuck exisiting. Fuck this life. I was not meant to be born here. I do not belong. I do not want to suffer any longer."
3047,Useless fucktard ranting,"I have been struggling with depression ever since childhood. I remember self harming at age 6 and trying to kms at age 14. I was a neglected as well as physically and mentally abused child. Once I moved out of my parent´s house I was hit with PTSD because of what I went through. I learned to dissociate when very young, and I still do it involuntarily to the extent it´s a problem in daily life. Not only do I go numb emotionally, I tend to zone out at any time. It´s like I´m just not there.

I excelled in school and at university but have never been able to hold onto a job because of my issues. I´m just wrong and don´t fit in anywhere, even though I have a high IQ. I´m currently a student working on a second degree, mostly because I can´t stand being home. As soon as I get home it´s like a heavy wet blanket is thrown over me and I can´t breathe. Being home causes anxiety. Being around people makes me feel alienated, because it´s so clear I´m very different from everyone else. I don´t have anything in common with them. 

My issues have made it impossible to sustain any lasting relationships, and I have also don´t like any sort of physical contact with others. My last boyfriend acknowledged I am very different from others which is what made him interested in the first place, but unfortunately he eventually lost interest, and I can´t blame him. I wouldn´t want to be with me. I never had a normal life and was never able to develop a normal and functioning personality. To my defense, if I ever hurt anyone it wasn´t deliberatly.

I once OD´d on roofies mixed with champagne and slept for two days straight. I wish I had died. My fondest wish is to disappear and not leave any trace behind. I don´t want to be remembered. Not only do I not want to exist. I want to never have existed, and I want to eradicate every trace of me. I keep my possessions to a minimum because of this and I plan to go on one last adventure into the mountains as soon as the snow goes away. I don´t plan on returning."
3048,Just me?,I feel so bad for wanting to go even though people have it way worse than me. I have so much to live for as well and still feel like shit. Messages/songs that make you wanna live no longer make a difference to me. I feel it's too late. I want to throw in the towel.
3049,I think I have depression but I don’t want to talk to my mom about it.,I have had no motivation for pretty much an entire year and I haven’t felt happy in months. The reason I don’t want to talk to my mom is because my brother has had some mental health issues lately and that’s really stressing her out. I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. I have a boyfriend who really hasn’t been there for me but I don’t have enough of a backbone to break up with him. Any advice/support is appreciated.
3050,I’m quite depressed and need help please.,"Hello. How are you? I hope you’re doing well because I’m not. I lost someone who meant very much to me last night and it was from my own doing. My own mistake. And I can’t get over it. I love her so much and she was the best friend I could’ve ever asked for. She would take care of me and make me laugh and smile and could calm me down when I was upset. She would sing to me when times are tough. She thought her singing was bad but it was so beautiful to me. I love her so much and I was so blessed to have her as a friend. Well I made a big mistake last night and I unintentionally hurt her and she was upset and I made some more incredibly large and stupid mistakes that led her to being more upset and she won’t talk to me now at all. I feel terrible. All I can think about is her and I’ve been sobbing all day and earlier I was puking. I’ve also developed even more suicidal thoughts from my already existing ones from my current depression and sadness that isn’t related to her. I just hope she’s doing ok. I love her so much. 

This isn’t the first time this has happened so coming from somebody who hasn’t had any real true friends in real life, I’m starting to believe I’m incapable of having them. I believe that perhaps I’m just a bad person and bad to the core and there’s nothing I can change about it. I just wish I wasn’t always the bad guy. I just wish I could be a good person.

I hope, I hope that perhaps I’m wrong and there is something good in me and maybe I can be a good person and a good friend. The only problem is, is that I’m just so afraid of what happened to her, will happen again. I don’t really know if I deserve a friend right now or if I’m even capable of having one. I guess I’m venting my emotions. Thank you for listening."
3051,The pursuit of happiness,"I constantly search for things to make me happy, and sometimes i am happy for a day or so but then reality sets in and nothing excites me or sparks my interest anymore. My video games, my money, nothing really pleases me anymore. But surprisingly, I've found that being around friends actually makes me genuinely happy. I realize I wanna stay around good company because when i make people laugh I don't feel empty inside. I don't feel alone. I don't feel bad. I want to make good memories, not regress to the bad memories. IDK this is probably a bad place to post this but I haven't felt like I had a purpose in such a long time it feels really good to make people smile and laugh. It feels good to have hope."
3052,I have a strong feeling that I'm going to die alone.,"It isn't often that I find a woman who is interested in me, but when I do, I tend to immediately become over-attached and I talk before I think. And while some could say that I could fix that, I don't think I can.

I'm definitely a loner. As I'm typing this, I'm sitting at a bar, drinking my sorrows away while ignoring every soul around me other than the bartender. To add, I'm in a college town; plenty of people my age, but none of which I'm interested in talking to.

But the moment that someone I've known for a while expresses that she's interested in me, unfortunately I go all in, and then the interest fades. I can't help it. I haven't had anyone interested in me in so long that I cant even think of how to act, and once I do, I push them away simply because of my excited behavior.

It doesn't help that my issues contribute to my suicidal thoughts that already exist. Loneliness isn't my only issue, but others decide to pile on at a weak point, so much to the point that I crumble under it.

And there, I am. If my familial history of health issues doesn't get me first, I'm almost certain that my mental health issues will take that into it's own hands."
3053,I’m a failing artist,"If I can’t succeed at this, I don’t see a point in life. I’ve sold a couple things. Been in a few shows. Have some stuff in a pop up gallery that never sells.

This was my life purpose for so long. It kept me going. I’m a failure. Now my depression only results in blocks. I’m bad at what I do, so why bother? I don’t know how much longer I can do this."
3054,No one cares,There's no point of my existence lol. I doubt that anyone would care if I weren't here and it's all I want.
3055,I don't know what to do.,"First time doing this so forgive me if it's a bit wonky. I'm 23 years of age and I still live with my family, normally this wouldn't be an issue but it very much is. I am the main provider in my family of 4. My mother and, I are the only ones working. My father takes us back and forth with the only car we have in our possession, and my little brother is a freshmen in high school and is currently being home schooled. We've been scrapping by day by day praying and hoping for somthing to happen for us. Except me. 

The reason for my father's lack of employment is do to my mother's and, my schedule. Mom heads to work at 3am and comes home around 12pm while I go to work from 12am to 8am. So my father can barely get enough sleep. I tried suggesting my mother to come to my place of work to work with me (sense I make more) while my dad goes and gets himself a job. So atleast then we would have 3 incomes coming in. She wont have any of it, dosent want to lose her pension and insurance, which I can kind of understand. My father on the other hand wont work with me becuase he has to much pride and dosent want to clean for a living. 

I cant do this for much longer and this is the reason I am reaching out. I can't seem to get my head above water. I can't even save up for anything, the money that goes into my savings ends up being needed by the end of the week. If I'm being honest I'm tired of being the main provider, I'm tired of having all the Bill's in my nake becuase my father and mother made bad decisions in their youth. The thing is though I dont know the first thing about standing up on my own two feet. I would leave, if I was heartless enough. Even then I have no where to go and no one to ask for help."
3056,Lost and confused,"Am I the only one scared to reach for help. Idk where to start, not only that scared of the outcome of seeking help and telling them what I truly feel because I have young kids that depend on me. Everything is becoming too much. Idk what to do."
3057,Cliff,"LI have such a vivid image of this cliff side. Somehow even though I've not had a look at one, it just keeps coming to mind. I think it comes to mind the moment I think about her. Where once there was joy and laughter, I now feel sadness and regret. Instead of memories that I look fondly on, I see images that make me want to cry. Why did I give my heart so easily again? Did I completely forget what happened last time? Did I forget the hurt and the pain that had me in toil before? The hurt that made two years go by without me even realising it. How many more years will I have to suffer with this? Why can't I just be content with the friends that I have? Why do I keep making it something more than it should be! Why do I try to awaken that which needs and wants to be left dormant? In any case, I have made up my mind. Never again, I don't want to feel this way again. It's time to pull up the walls and put on the mask. Hide away the pain with jokes and laughter. Suppress the emotions that are clearly just toying with you. Grow up and learn that life isn't some game, it's not a fantasy world with you as it's protagonist. It's a scary place filled with sorrow and suffering. But enough of this, let me go back to the cliff.
The image is in the evening just after the sun has set. I stand at the edge of a cliff facing a person I thought I loved. The fall beyond the edge is deep. It's a straight fall into a vast forest filled with acres of trees. All you can see is the greenery from the tops of the trees. But that doesn't mean it'll be a safe landing. You can be assured that a fall will very much result in demise! I peer at this face that once brought joy. Now as I look back, there is some happy thoughts but it keeps getting muddled in a dark colour. It's as if I don't want to remember anything. It's like my brain is blotting away any memories out of existence. Where I once was begging for it to not end, I'm asking to be put out of misery. It's a turn that I could not predict and that I definitely did not expect! As I stand there looking at her, she appears to be saying something to me. The words are all slurred and my brain doesn't make out any words. And then all of a sudden, she nudges me on the shoulder. I lose my balance and slip down the void. It's a long drop and so I have time to gather my thoughts. Why did I ever fall in love again? Why couldn't I just be satisfied with the friends and family I had in my life. I look back knowing I had a lot to learn."
3058,I left my friends and it's all my fault,"I just lost all my friends I being really depressed and I kept telling them to ignore me because I was a lost cause I don't think that they took that seriously but I was having a break down that time. They kept telling me that things are going to get better but it hurt when one of my past friends said hey. Not hi Chris or anything just hey. I was in line for the bathroom so I just cried and I lost it. I think everyone is starting to find out I'm depressed and I mean EVERYONE in the SCHOOL. My teachers are treating me differently. Some friends don't talk to me anymore and I'm just leading down a spiral at this. Also, I really hope my friends forgot what I said because I was fucked then so I did something instinctively which was to push them away so they don't get contaminated. They told ALL my friends I'm depressed. I've been exposed. The only people who don't know is my family who constantly bully and tease me and they just say it's to ""toughen you up"" . I cant tell anyone because I'm so bad at confrontation and I just cry."
3059,I don't wanna die,"But I don't want to get better. 
I'm just tired of trying. I don't want to be a burden to anyone, but I don't want to disappoint my family. I just wanted to have an accident or something. I'm on medication and psychotherapy, but nothing seems to get better."
3060,Numb,"I dont know what's wrong with me. I feel numb I feel nothing kinda and I've been cutting to get a relief and just sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry but I cant, and I get angry easily and when I'm happy it's very easy for me to become numb again. I'm not sure cause I guess I'm not exactly sad and I've had this before but I never feel valid I guess cause I dont even understand my feelings."
3061,Not in a good place,"I moved to a new place in order to try something new. It’s been good but I haven’t made enough friends to always have something to do on weekends. Like tonight. It doesn’t help that my gf seems to be having a ton of fun with her friends (she’s moving out here in a couple months). Or that my friends are posting on IG and snap and they seem to be having a great time. I know this feeling is irrational because I’ve had plenty of good times out here as well but my fomo is getting the best of me. 

The worst part is that I get interest from people in hanging out but it’s been mostly women and I feel like it’s a more than just friends type of interest. I’m starting to see why people in long distance relationships break up. It sucks I want to be with her but I also don’t like feeling so lonely."
3062,"I’m not scared of change, i’m scared to try again","I have tried to ‘get out’ of depression. Went to college, got a job, got a psychiatrist and therapist. I’m a drop out now. Ive gotten fired for “my head not being there”, been told i can’t be helped by a psychiatrist, and either the therapist is helpful but unprofessional (meaning they cancelled on me consistently), helpful but i can’t see them cause i can’t afford it, or unhelpful in general. Why can’t someone just HELP me get on my feet and i’ll do the rest myself? I just want someone to listen and I want results from what I do. I’m getting tired of this getting knocked down every time i take a step forward bullshit."
3063,I wanna be happy but I am not even sure what would make me happy anymore,I was talking with my mom and she asked me what would make me happy again. Wasn’t really sure how to respond to that question. I am not really interested in anything anymore. Everything is just so uninteresting and boring. How am I supposed to find happiness if I don’t even know what will make me happy?
3064,feel empty and stuck,"tbh i feel like i have no right to be posting here- my life is fine. im just being so moody and i don’t know why.
in the past few years I’ve been going through long periods where i just feel like nothing. No reason to be sad but I am so fucking sad and upset. I lose all motivation for anything such as school
i don’t like it at all I want to make it stop but I feel stuck I can’t make myself happy and it’s frustrating me so much i just lie there or sit there for hours crying and I don’t even know why I just feel like I can’t be happy

i need it to go away please :c"
3065,It's like I am two different people,"Occasionally I'll go through short spells of a few days where suddenly I feel like life has a purpose again and I'm not a worthless piece of shit. I think to myself, how is it possible that I was ever was suicidal, life is pretty OK. Which of course makes me question whether I was really depressed at all or if I was just faking it for attention or an easy way out to blame my mistakes on. Then when I get back to my usual, I think, how is it possible that I could ever be that happy? When I'm in either state it seems completely impossible to me that I was ever in the other, and that I had thoughts like that. It feels like I am two different people and it's completely random which one I will be when I wake up. Anyone else feel this way?"
3066,I hit myself,"Whenever I’m more upset than usual and I do something dumb or I just feel really bad, I hit myself. It’s usually I hit my hit, arm, and legs. I dont know why but for some reason it makes me feel better for a few minutes and then it comes back and it happens all over again."
3067,Already having quarter life crisis,"I know I shouldn’t follow others opinions and forced myself to watch something I don’t like because the fandom is so devoted with all the series. I only like series 1. I don’t like series 2 and 3. 

And then I see comments on how the show changed their life and they in love with all the series which I still can’t relate. I wish I can feel the same . I love the first series a lot. Just not the newer series that came out when I was an adult, it just not the same as the one as I was a teen. 

I do realize the comments are by teenagers yet I kept being consumed by comments and why I say my own opinions they would go all army mode and say I’m not a real fan if I don’t like all. It hurt me a lot. So I try to watch them, still I don’t like them. 
Is

Because they were spin-off of the original it does click me the same. I just envy others who are able to click with all the series. I really wish I can feel the same. 

I know their opinions is theirs and my opinions are mine. But I tend to try to forced to do things I don’t like so I would be appected by others. I’m pushing myself too much I know that. 

I know I stolid stop looking at comments. And everytime I see comments off in a video I felt relief for some reason. That I don’t have to forced myself to read the comments. It’s kinda a habit of mine to watch videos before watching for 30 mins. 

When I was a teen I didn’t care at all what others think. But suddenly when I became adult in 2016 I suddenly became so sensitive after I graduated high school and felt I need to be likeable or people will hate me so I try to follow what others do. Also I went through a “i only worship 80’s songs” as a teen. So I really was outdated with the world so I’m 2014 I decided to update myself by listening Ariana Grande songs and been a fan since. 
And now I feel it’s a crime to be outdated and when I not updated I get upset about myself."
3068,I drove all of my friends away.,"I've been so hermitic and depressed these past few years, I have barely been going out or spending time with friends. And whenever I do, my OCD makes it so that I ruminate negatively on every single interaction the next day. I go crazy thinking about what I said or did to people. I've pushed all of my friends away. No one likes me. I'm so very lonely.

Depression and OCD are ruining my life. I'm 27 and I've wasted every single second I've lived. I'm also scum and this is exactly what I deserve. Doomed to live a sad and hermitic life, hated by those around me, until my binge-eating disorder gives me a heart attack. I'm too much of a wuss to kill myself.

I want to have a good, long cry so badly but I can't seem to do so."
3069,"Tonight, I’m frustrated","I'm upset that there are so many innocent people who are suffering and struggling to simply live. It’s cruel and it does not discriminate, I’m angry that every single day it takes innocent lives of people who just wanted to live but couldn’t. Nobody deserves to be a prisoner of their own mind, I wish more than anything that we can all find inner peace within ourselves. We don’t deserve this but it chose us and we need to fight it we can’t let it win."
3070,Lost,"I feel like I have lost myself. I used to never even have thought about depression because I was always happy and never seemed to have problems, but once I moved and lost all my friends I have started to feel invisible. After I moved I was able to find friends but over time I noticed that I was not valued by them, and I was left alone. I present myself to be a strong-minded person but internally I am starting to breakdown and fall apart. I wish someone would just care about me and make me feel valued. I am lost and struggling to find help, and each day I am trying to get better and focus on things to distract me from my depression but I am now unable to forget it. Recently, my dog died and my depression started to get even worse as I had lost one of my best friends. The death of my dog has led me to feel more alone than I ever have. Every day I feel useless, invisible, and vulnerable and I have started to lose focus on the things that will define my future. I was a straight-A student in AP and IB classes and loved going to school and learning but over time as my depression got worse, I couldn't focus and be myself anymore. I started to become less able to handle the pressure of trying to get good grades and the stress of school. However, I have been able to start and recover through going surfing, it gives me time to think and reflect on what is going on in my life. This sport has enabled me to help me feel more like myself again, and I encourage you guys to try and find something similar because I believe it can really help as it did for me."
3071,Don’t trust myself to tune 21,So I’m bipolar and during either manic or depressive episodes I become really reliant on substances or any sort. I’ve been dealing with this since the episodes started my freshman year of high school. It just comes and goes for either so long that it never seems to end or so quickly it didn’t feel real. It’s hard being depressed and everyone tell me that I’m not acting like myself when I don’t even know who I am without my episodes. Like I question happiness because it could be mania even thought I know what I’m really like when I’m manic. Nothing feels real anymore. The only thing that grounds me in the slightest if my cat. I really wouldn’t be around without her. When I think of real happiness I think of her even though she can be a bitch. What I’m trying to get at is I’m turning 21 and I’m currently in a episode. How the hell do I turn 21 and not become an alcoholic. I mean I don’t have the money for it but that literally won’t stop me from finding a way? Sure say “just stay away from it”. That’s so much harder than it sounds and I was also looking forward to buying my first pack of cigarettes but I promised a friend I’d stop smoking. I know this sounds like a lot of whiny and self pity but holy crap I try to stay on my meds which frequently make me sick and I don’t think are working to begin with and limit myself on fun times all so everyone else around me doesn’t feel like they’re watching me suffer. I’m suffer anyways because it’s gotten to the point that I wanna throw myself into the abyss but I’m stay planted my cat and my family and my friends. Yes my cat is first and foremost. Even if she gets mad at my cuddling her too much we never fight unlike any other relationship I’ve had. Animals are the best. Anyways if you read this thanks. Have a good one
3072,I don't want to die I just want to not exist,"I can feel myself slowly deteriorating. I've lost 10 lbs in  a week I don't think I'm dying but all I want is to fall asleep forever and the one person I want to talk to is too busy for me. I'm alone. I want to die I have two bottles of Xanax I can take at anytime yes I know I'm needed. Please I don't want don't commit suicide. I won't but it's a true desire. 

I seem to have the perfect life. I'm done I can't continue to write this post. I am exhausted. This is exausting"
3073,Life has been a waste,I just turned 18 not that long ago and it seems like all the time I’ve spent on this earth has been a total waste. All the way up till high school I was a secluded and introverted kid and when I finally came out of my shell and got some friends I’ve just been making mistakes the entire time. All of my high school life has been spent in regret of what might have been had I made different decisions and also self hatred for what I have done. It seems as if I’ll never make the right choices and life will continue to be just as awful as it has been so it makes me feel why suffer through a terrible existence when I could just end it all. I’m afraid what would be on the other side but every single day as of late has been spent in anger and sadness and makes me think that whatever there is when and if I kill myself could only be better than what I’m living through right now.
3074,i want to kill myself i dont understand how to use redit,i want tonight to be the night i commit to killing myself everything is going wrong
3075,Why?,"I fell asleep at 5PM. Just couldn't keep my eyes open. Just woke up (it's 11:25PM). During that time, I had 2 dreams that my ex and I got back together. The one dream I truly want to come true. Why? Why the fuck do they do this to me? I can't forget her, but they continuously drop dreams I don't want into my fucking head."
3076,helping others because you can’t help yourself,Is it just me because like I always want to help others because I know I can’t help myself. The fact that helping others makes me feel better than helping myself is just more satisfying. I don’t feel hopeless anymore.
3077,I want to kill a girl for not loving me,Fucking bitch
3078,Pristiq side effects,"Hi redditors.

I started Pristiq(Desvenlafaxine) a week ago and recently i’m experiencing severe agitation like i feel extremely aware of everything like my mind is racing a 500000km/hour like i’m on the edge.

Is this normal side effect? Since i’ve been on every ssri and all they caused severe sedation but is snri supposed to be like this?"
3079,I’m all alone,Just blocked everyone all my contacts all my friends deleted my insta my Snapchat I don’t know what’s wrong with me I destroy everything I touch I don’t want to exist because I hurt everyone I love but I can’t die because I’d hurt everyone I love I don’t know who I am anymore I don’t see the light in the end or a tunnel I can’t keep my head up anymore it doesn’t get better it’s only gotten worse fuck Christmas fuck the new year it’s all meaningless everything is meaningless
3080,Why bother doing anything?,"Every day I count the hours until its time to sleep again. I count the days until the weekend. Then I count the weeks until the month is over, and count the months until I am a year older. Why bother going through this pointless cycle? I have literally nothing I look forward to, its like I'm on life support just waiting to die.  There is no change from day to day, its just the same bleak, endless slog through pointless distraction after distraction, and all I can see in the future is more and more of the same empty crap. The only other thing I do besides distract myself from myself is be a burden on others and bring them down with my negativity and neediness. All I bring is pain and annoyance to others. So why continue?"
3081,dad didn’t even stay my whole high school graduation (class of 2019),"he left during the ceremony to “beat traffic” like are you fucking kidding me dude. 

i never got the chance to make him proud, and once i finally have something to show for it, he fucking dips out. all i wanted to do is show him that his son isn’t just some lazy pothead burnout and seems like i can’t even do that. i don’t have a single picture with me and him on my phone. no birthdays. no FUCKING HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. nothing"
3082,i am so lonely,graduated college recently. couldn’t find a job in my field. moved away from family/friends for work (outside my field). hate my job. no work-life balance. recent breakup. no time to make new friends. low self esteem. anxiety. panic attacks. extremely lonely. nobody to talk to. help.
3083,I miss the Person I used to be,"Before everything happened, I had my life ahead of me. I had a really close group of friends, and I did exponially well in school so that I would get a good scholarship. I really dont know who I am anymore. Even though I struggled with my weight I still cared about myself and I was confident.I try to reach out to friends but i just feel like I have lost that connection from them. I take medication and talk to a therapist. I have 2 weeks left to finish two online classes that are required for me to graduate. I started to finally feel like myself again at the beginning of the semester. I now realize I’ll never be who I was. I hate how who am is now sadness and  bitterness. I truly feel that I would be better off dead. it really is quite pitiful im typing all of this in a reddit post"
3084,I was depressed because almost everybody don’t want to go to my party,"I invite a total of fifteen people which are my friends. But only two of my friends showed up. Others have all kinds of reasons
Izzy and Vamika are my best friends. They did not come 
I was looking for help on how I can go pass the moment
Thank to Sam and Lizzie who come to my party love you guys"
3085,I've lost a friend and a boyfriend in a span of a week now I don't even know what to do anymore.,"Honestly, I feel like it's my own fault that they left me. I feel like I did something to make them not want to have anything to do with me anymore, even though I know I didn't do anything to upset them. I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I feel like I'm bothering or annoying them. I feel worthless, like I'm not worth anyone's time and energy. I feel like I failed my friends. I can't even keep a long lasting friendship, let alone a long term relationship, because I somehow ruin them. I don't even know what to do anymore."
3086,Depression/Anxiety and A conundrum,"So my mom is severely mentally ill and all my life has been verbally abusive and though my dad tries to defend me in the end he just enables her by ignoring it's a problem. 

My cat I had for 12.5 years died in my arms two days after my birthday in October. My mom had one of her episodes where she just crossed the line with the vemon she spewed and I told her I needed a break. I didnt go for Thanksgiving and have generally felt better not seeing my parents. 

I texted my dad on Thursday and again today to ask a question about Christmas and I havent gotten a response. My anxiety is just going wild now, is he ok is he hurt did he die, would mom even tell me now. Is he ok?

I know if I texted mom she'd respond but I want to keep the boundary between us because I know what will happen if I give in. But I dont know what to do. Should I assume hes ok? I hate anxiety it makes me spiral down and makes me feel so bad all the time.

What would you do?"
3087,I’m having a really tough night and could use someone to talk to.,I’m having a really tough time tonight. I’ve attempted suicide twice and I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. I’ve lost so many friends and family over the past couple of years I just don’t know what to do. I don’t have anyone I can talk to.
3088,Tired of this life,"The world keeps getting scarier and I keep getting lonelier. I don’t know if it’s ever going to work out for me at this point. Everyday something is telling me to give up, whether I just run away or die. I can’t do the same thing every single day of my life. I’m not even scared anymore I just want to go somewhere familiar and go to sleep and not wake up."
3089,I feel like a complete failure,"The main reason I even created a reddit account was because I have a pretty severe anxiety disorder and i wanted to meet some new people and form friendships and if a relationship happened to form then that too. That was about 6 or 7 months ago and I haven't made a single friend who's stuck around for more than a few days. I thought it would make me feel better to try and put myself out there more. I've always thought that I'm a good person who deserves to have lots of friends. Most of the people I interact with tell me I'm pretty funny, I don't start any drama, I'm a pretty easy going person. Maybe I'm just biased. Maybe the problem is me? What's wrong with me? Why am I this way? How can I change? Are some people just meant to be alone? Is that truly how cruel the world is that some people are never meant to form much human connection or interaction? How is living better than nothing at all?"
3090,I can’t do this anymore,My dad is sick and not getting better but getting worse. I got rejected from only halfway decent schools while troublemaking students with good grades and ACT scores are getting into Harvard (literally) my life is disappointing and I am nothing. I want to be a doctor but who knows. My crush doesn’t know I exist. My family is judge mental. My mom is a wreck because my dad is sick. I am slightly overweight I hate myself for being lazy. Life isn’t worth living anymore. Life is boring. I have accomplished nothing and will never accomplish anything. I’m a 17 year old girl who has seen hell and I am over it.
3091,I am quite content to let my life go to shit,"I feel great. No lie. I haven’t done anything all day, but my brain finally stopped screaming at me (it sounds weird, but that’s literally what happens) so yay :)"
3092,Anyone feel so numb,I feel nothing most of the time but I’m always doubting myself. I always feel guilty that I don’t feel depressed and I just feel nothing so I’m not actually depressed.
3093,Im writing a diary to remind myself that I'm a pimp,I'm really hoping that this works because I haven't felt like myself lately
3094,my cat never came back (a continuation from my last r/depression post),"its been almost 3 days now, no sign of my cat. i assume that he ran away and died or something. i cant convey sadness through text, but i can say that i dont know what to do about it. my dad and my granny say that they should just get a new baby kitten, since the cat we had was wild and kinda just showed up one day. a fresh start would be nice, but i cant just give up on my cat like that. i know that its slim chance if my cat was still alive at this point, but i just cant get the thought that he is still alive somewhere out of my mind. i dont need to cope, and i dont need help. im just asking you guys a simple question: should i give up on my cat and get a new one?"
3095,i just wanna die in your arms,"you weren't perfect, our relationship wasn't perfect, neither was i, but those were the happiest moments of my life. there were problems, but i thought we could get through it, get past it, solve it, communicate, that shit, i just wanna hold your hands, i wanna hold you, i feel so goddamn lonely, im always alone and i thought you'll be w me forever this is so stupid and dumb n emo n cringy im so fucking stupid never understood why you fell for me, im so unlovable and stupid and just a fucking worthless piece of shit overall a waste of space a nuisance you came nd told me that i made you happy and that made me so fucking happy i wanted to die never had someone tell me that before like me???? making people happy??????? fuck fuck fuck fuck please kill me i wouldnt mind strangle me and let me die in happiness right now pelase

3096,why do i isolate myself? how do i stop?,being talkative and happy just feels like too much work right now
3097,Girlfriend of 4 years left me..,"Girl I've been dating for 4 years since I was 17 left me last week. We had so many plans, and goals to work towards. We had our issues, but so does every relationship. I've just been at a loss of what to do. I haven't been eating or sleeping, and i know it isn't healthy but I've probably been drunk every day since it happened.

I just needed to vent. I gave this girl everything. I passed up a school opportunity so she could go and get her degree first while I workes construction to pay bills. So now I'm stuck and can't really do what I wanna do. She never wanted for anything. I'm just incredibly hurt and down. I love her to death but there's no chance we'll get back together."
3098,What can I do?,"I’m very depressed. It’s been a year since I’ve finished my Bachelors degree, but no job, no friends and my life feels like it’s going nowhere. My family (parents and grandparents) are very supportive and I am very thankful for having them in my life, but that doesn’t seem to make me feel any less sad. What can I do?"
3099,I'm about to explode,"My jobs is the absolute worst and the hardest part is how it fucks about touting itself as such a great company and how they are SOOOOO focused on mental health, but then over work, under pay and generally abuse their employees and allow customers to also be abusive to us.

I hate my job so much I just took a hot shower and the thought of going back tomorrow gives me so much anxiety I start crying and getting angry because it is the only way I can cope with how trapped I feel.

I passed my test, I hot a B in my math class. But I was hoping to work more in December to pay off my tuition from last semester to reenroll by spring in february AND IT ISNT HAPPENING.

I work 6 days and get less than 30 hrs and I cannot absolutely cannot cope. It makes me want to puke. I am so overwhelmed I just want to die.

I am going to snap tomorrow but I need to go in because I have to go in, but I am going to snap. But I cant afford to not show up, no amount of sick time can pay for this. I cannot do this at all. I can't. I dont know what I'll do tomorrow, but I will lose it, and I'll lose it on company time because if I cant afford to take care of myself, they can take the cost of it. I dont give a fuck."
3100,Genetically unfortunate .,"I am a male, 26 years old, in the best shape of my life, have hobbies, been told I am good looking (though I consider myself to be mediocre looking at very best), and am fortunate to have knack for using my introversion and awkwardness to my advantage in social situations. Anxiety and depression don't run as rampant as I am now taking care of myself and am acting on achieving my goals. However, I have a weakness in the form of unviability in the romantic department, despite how ""interesting"" I could ever make myself. This is because I have gynecomastia.  


Gynecomastia, for those who don't want to take the time Google search it, is feminine breast tissue within males. This, is a *cripplingly* tough barrier for initiating and sustaining romantic interests. It's bizarre, because past rejection has domino effected itself into a defense mechanism. Not only do I immediately become scornful of any girl who flirts with me, but now anybody who displays human decency toward me sets me off into a literal primal attack mode. No longer do I even so much as think of starting conversations with woman I find attractive and/or interesting, or even ""taking it a step further"" with woman whom I may be already acquainted with because I have convinced myself I have a 100% rejection rate. The humiliation is inevitable and unbearable for me. In the freak event I find a girl who is willing to compromise, why should she have to even make the compromise? Just go away and find somebody who can rightfully fulfill your needs.  


The above mentioned it what I believe to be a root cause. The subject matter is too embarrassing to discuss with a councilor, yet alone to a loving family member or one of my handful of decent acquaintances. I'm saying ""decent acquaintances"" because I can't even have what can be considered real friends at this point due to what is becoming of my mental state. I mean, what could they possibly do to solve my problem? They say loneliness is an equivalent smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day, and I believe that. My body is physically ill as I write this, regardless of the stacked circumventing efforts I make to better myself.  


Keep in mind I take care of myself. I go to the gym, only drink water (shoutout to the hydrohomies), walk my dog (my is a godsend, can provide dog tax), don't eat garbage food, intermittent fast, get good sleep, act on creative interests,  and am not overweight (I'm 5'11, 155 lbs), therefore, it cannot be fat, fat would show signs of deterioration, it has to be genuine breast tissue from being genetically unfortunate."
3101,My daily routine,It’s sad that I don’t do much with my life. The only thing I’m good at is crying in my bedroom every night.
3102,Exbf threatens to leak my nudes to friends,"Its really stressful....
We broke up weeks ago and he threatened to leak my nudes with friends... He fking tried to reach out to me last week, which made me isolate myself.
I cant shake off this feeling, that he's going to leak it anytime.
What can I do in this kind of situation?"
3103,Soemtimes.,"I admit, sometimes i get jealous of some females. Sometimes i wish i felt special to my boyfriend. 
I like utter fucking shit."
3104,I've decided. I'm going to kill myself,"I don't know when. I'm not quite sure how. I'm just tired of working my ass off in hopes of something working out, and it never happening. I'm tired of feeling good and then getting fucked over by life immediately afterwards. I'm tired of people not understanding, or worse, not trying to understand. I'm tired or wearing a smile to school and censoring myself in front of my counselor to avoid being forced back into a hospital. I'm tired of hoping for some reprieve in my shitstorm of a life. I don't want to life my life around people who have everything I want and more, yet complain about everything. I'm tired of doing for everyone but no one doing shit for me. I'm sorry to all of the people that I know love and care about me, because I know that my death will hurt you. I wish your support could've kept me going longer than it has. But here I am, writing this message to people that don't know me, for no reason other than to get it off my chest. I'm tired of trying to acheive, hoping for things to happen, because life just does not want me to have anything. It sucks knowing that in the game of life that I pulled the shittiest cards only by chance. So... I'm done hoping. I'm done trying. I'm done living. I might as well already be dead, I'm just waiting for an excuse to die."
3105,i’m so tired,"i don’t wanna wake up i don’t like where i am or who i am or anything anymore i just want to go to sleep. life is so full of disappointment and i know there’s happy stuff but the bad feelings are so bad and i don’t know how to be okay. i feel like every day i’m losing more and more memory of who i am and i just want to go back or something i just don’t like the place i’m at right now and no one around me seems so care about the right stuff. it’s just school and failure and temporary excitement, i just want to be happy with myself on my own and not have to reach for temporary things like drugs and alcohol to make me feel better for a short time. no one will listen to me and i don’t wanna talk about it anymore. i just want to disappear and have everyone forget about me"
3106,So tired of defending myself,I have had severe depression since I was a child I am now into my 40's and my husband doesnt seem to understand that I have a extreme problem with intimacy. I am constantly defending myself and explaining why I do not want to be intimate
3107,My life is the worst it's ever been,"My life is the best it's ever been but I feel the worst. I was scrolling through my old iCloud and I miss when I was anorexic and severely depressed because at least I had friends. At least I didn't develop severe BPD and want to always break up with my amazing boyfriend because I AM unhappy and I feel I need to change something immediately. I do well in school, I have a great family. But I'm fat, I have no friends, I don't have any hobbies or anything that keeps me happy. I cannot afford therapy and I hate medicine. I just want to start over. I want to go back to high school and fix mistakes I made so I'd be in a different spot now. I want to connect to people so I can have friends. I hate my life so severely and I feel so trapped and I'm not sure what to do.

TL;DR: I'm so depressed and I need to change something in my life but I'm not sure what. I feel trapped and I don't know what to do."
3108,TRIGGER WARNING: self harm,"I cut myself tonight. Badly. My boyfriend got mad at me and I completely unraveled. 

I haven’t cut in years. I feel like such a failure. I just bought a condo, I got a good job at a reputable company. There are so so many things for me to be proud of myself for and happy about, but something inside of my mind always nags me and tells me I’m not worth any of this. 

Just really needed to get this off my chest. No one knows. I’m at my parents house now because I just want to lay in my moms bed.

I wish I didn’t feel so broken."
3109,am i depressed or just bored?,"hi; so the only mental health diagnosis I’m pretty certain I have is adhd; i get anxiety but it’s mainly involving me not feeling like i’m where i need to be in life (24, still in college that kind of thing). i’m almost through with being on probation for a year for getting arrested for a dui about a year and a half ago (only time getting arrested and i’ve definitely learned my lesson not to do it again plus this whole year i’ve been preocuppied with keeping track of meetings/community service stuff etc and working on top of that so i haven’t really had that much time to socialize). i’m happy it’s almost over but i’ve just felt this overwhelming sense of boredom the whole time, i’ve tried to spend my alone time off from work working on unfinished projects like music production, writing and other art stuff. my anxiety’s pretty weird when i haven’t seen people in a while, which makes i thought I might also be depressed. so I spent the last month trying out lexapro. i got anxious about being on the meds so i stopped taking them before they really took effect (i had been on it before a few years ago and hadn’t really felt any different tbh but it made me crash really hard off my adhd meds at the end of the day which was annoying). this time though i could swear i did feel a bit more balanced/better but because i’m generally kind of freaked out about antidepressants and thought it could just be a placebo i was only taking the starting dose (5mg) just to see if it would help my anxiety at first then maybe start taking 10mg if i didn’t have any negative side effects. i took zoloft in high school and it was pretty much terrible and made me a different person so that’s why they freak me out. i’m stopping because didn’t really notice anything different but my mental state has just been so apathetic lately that i’m kind of worried i’ll start just feeling shitty all the time. does anyone else here have this, like just a constant feeling of feeling like you need to do something extra to fix the way you feel right now but not really in the context of drugs or something like that? just like maybe your brain chemistry’s off balance but you aren’t “depressed” per se, just bored and apathetic?"
3110,Going to end my life after Christmas,"I don't want to rune the holidays for my family and friends, but I can't go on any anymore. I lost my job last month and have yet to find a new one, and now I had enough money to pay bills for this months but once next year's rolls around, I'm done money wise. It's better this way. I didn't come here to ask anyone to talk me out of it, I just needed to say I'm doing it and get it off my chest. I've been depressed even before I lost my job and that was just the final nail."
3111,I push people away because...,"I push people away because I don’t think I deserve to be their friend. They are better than me...

I don’t talk to people that I know because I don’t want to disturb them."
3112,I want to jump off a bridge.,"It seems like I already failed, and there's nothing left for me here. I want to leave before I actually drag someone else down with me. I want to be put to sleep, and then put to rest. I can't believe this isn't an option yet. I want to die. I can't yet, but the more I live the more is wasted, and everything has been sacked away from me. Please kill me."
3113,I feel like I’m stuck in my own waking hell.,"   I feel incredibly lonely all of the time because I am by myself for a vast majority of my days except for my job and one friend that I have. I live with my parents as I just graduated a few months ago
    High school ended shitty, I lost my friends because a girl I was dating spread rumors around my super right wing school that I was a furry and that I “did terrible things.” And “deserved to die.”  Btw I’m not innocent. I was wish washy and went back to an ex soon after breaking up with her, but she pressured me a lot into desicions about our relationship. Moved it quick. I wanted out. I didn’t cheat though I swear. She believes she is a witch and caused my stomach disease. Weird I know, I learned it from a friend who left me to be her friend after he recently reached out to me. 
   Now I’m not a furry but that is besides that point. The friends I had left me not only because of the rumors but some of them for the girls that were perpetuating the stuff that was ruining my social life. 
   All of the while; as though that were not enough, I become extremely ill. Spasms, general pain and swelling in the intestines accompanied by daily rectal tearing, diarrhea, extreme gas and gastric pain accompanied by swelling, mucus in my stool, black stool, and nausea, vomiting, and general lack of sleep, (talking 2-4 good hours, then I wake up having to toss or pee or barf every 30 mins to an hour). 
   It gets so bad that I have to go to the hospital and get all kinds of pills and scans and treatments and they still can’t tell me what it is or how to fix it. I owe a lot let’s just leave it at that. Enough to where I’m not going to try to think about school (college).
   So after all that I say, “okay it’s fine. I’ll be the good guy and move on.” So I did. I graduate, get a cool climbing job at a summer camp running a ropes course with a friend, but I’m constantly reminded of my weak body by the pain and spasms and snotty poop and the terrible noises in the night. Or the constant discomfort in the car. The fact that I can’t work at least once a week physically and the fact that I get sick for a flare up that can last a week or more.
   But at least at camp I have friends. The doctors also gave me news that I had to lower my diet to cut out oils, fats, red meat, fruit with skins, high fiber veggies, artificial flavors, lactose, white bread, carbonation, and other things, and I lost 25 lbs in a month.
   However I still felt okay. I liked my job and was well supported by my community. I had a very active faith life as well that kept me afloat, but then the summer ended...and my car broke down...and I came back home with my parents whom I love dearly, don’t mistake me, but they can be nagging and reminding of the harder things, or hurtful things. My friends have also vanished. 
   It’s hard to keep in touch. I just can’t get the courage to text that often. I feel annoying, or maybe I’m not really interested. I don’t really know anymore. All the while it feels like my insides are melting, my debt is piling up, my hours at my job are shrinking and it feels like the only time I have fun is with my only friend who I hold close. 
   At work my coworkers are trying to get me to fuck a girl that they know as a friend because we are both lonely. I find this degrading and it only pushes me further down into this darkness that I feel inside. I don’t even think about women sexually anymore, or men. The most I want is a romance. 
   I can’t fix my car because my hours are small because I keep getting sick because I can’t go to the hospital because I can’t afford to because I can’t work. Fucked up. So that’s my life. In need of some luck as my 2019 comes to a crashing collapse. Signing off. 
   ~I don’t even know anymore."
3114,Couples,"What happens when two people with depression and borderline personality disorder break-up? ...asking for a freind from Overwatch, I guess? The unlucky question my dude."
3115,"I thought I'd be dead by 18, now I'm 20 and I have no idea what to do with myself. Everything feels hopeless.","As the title suggests, I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a good majority of my life and I honestly never thought I'd make it to 18. I did somehow, and now two years later I'm completely lost. I graduated high school and took a gap year to focus on medical stuff. I also wanted to get a part time job, but I had no luck in that department. I decided to enroll at college, not because I wanted to, but because I was bored. It's drilled into me that if I don't go to college, I'll never be successful. I felt useless at home because I couldn't get hired for even basic entry level retail positions - in order to get a job, you need experience, but to get experience, you need a job. Cue an endless loop of not getting hired. I did well my first semester and got straight A's, but I didn't enjoy any of my classes. I have no idea what I want to major in. I have no idea what I like or what my career should be. When I was a kid I always dreamed I would create content (writing books, directing movies, making music, acting, etc.) but my creative spirit and my confidence have been completely crushed by years of trauma. I don't have the confidence to try to get into the entertainment industry because I know I'll fail. I feel like I have nothing to offer the world, and even if I did, I doubt anyone would give me a chance to prove myself anyway. 

I'm scared of committing to a more practical job/major before I have any experience, because then I'd just be putting myself in debt for a career I don't even know if I'll enjoy. Nothing sounds enjoyable, but that's probably just depression. I have no idea where to start. Everyone else my age and younger seems to have a general idea about what they're passionate about or where they'd like to go, but I'm nearing 21 and I have absolutely no fucking idea. I never got the chance to explore any of this stuff when I was a teenager because I was too busy trying to survive. I feel so worthless, and it's even worse since I can't even land a part time job. I've been trying to find at least something almost nonstop but I haven't had any luck. It's not that I act unpleasant or impolite - most people are shocked to find out I'm depressed because I act so confident and extroverted. But it's all just bullshit, I think about dying constantly lately. I don't know what's wrong with me. Is this all I'm ever going to amount to? Being a failure leeching off my parents, unable to decide where I want to go? I probably couldn't even launch a successful career even if I knew where I wanted to go. What's the point of any of this?"
3116,Its all about me,My mom told today that I always make things about me... I try not to be such a debbie downer or make stuff about me and I just feel that if I'm gone that I wont take up everyone else's time
3117,The lying bitch that I am.,"I used to be a really bad person. I lied about having a girlfriend who killed herself to make myself sound more interesting. But I had a moment where I decided I was going to be better. I have been trying to be better for the past three years. But when I told my ""friends"" that I had lied to them I lost all of their support. That happened a year ago. So fast forward to a week ago I shut off my friend's computer just to fuck with him and he yells out why don't you go make up another girlfriend. The second he said that everyone looked at me. I felt fucking ashamed. I couldn't deal with the guilt I felt. I told him later how much him saying that hurt me. He didn't care. He said that I had this coming and that I was probably faking my depression as well. I blocked him and I started shaking. All I could feel was pure pain. I saw him at school the next day trying to convince what little friends I have left what a dick I am, and he slowly started to convince me. I tried to say something to him about it and he pretended like everything was fine. I don't think I can go on like this. I'm not the same person that I was but I feel like my life will be defined by the lying that I've done and I think I'm going to kill myself sometime next year if nothing changes. Spoiler alert. Nothing will."
3118,Completely hopeless and out of patience,"I keep trying but I'm mentally and physically exhausted. I keep getting blamed and receiving consequences for doing the right thing and the douchey people who are disrespectful to me get away scot-free. My family who used to be more supportive are not supporting me emotionally at all, even though they say they are. Instead they're making things worse. My friends who used to be there for me have either completely abandoned me for reasons I don't understand, or they just don't care/don't want to hear about my issues/don't want to help. I'm dealing with PTSD issues from being bullied at two work places and am terrified to work while meanwhile eating through my savings.

 I no longer can trust anyone after being burnt so many times and that means a significant other is out of the question. It also means kids are out of the question since I know I wouldn't be able to handle raising them alone, plus my energy level and mental state isn't good enough for raising kids. I had always wanted kids, so that's hurting me, but the lack of love on ALL accounts is hurting me more. I used to feel very loved by family and friends and now I don't at all. I promise I have always been a kind, caring, respectful person, so it's extremely unfair and nonsensical. 

I've finally learned to assert myself when people are not respecting me, yet my feelings never matter and I end up being reamed out and painted as the douchebag when in reality the other person is the douchebag. I've tried over and over thinking oh this is just a fluke, but it's now the norm and I just can't handle it anymore. I'm youngish, but the thought of going through decades more of this stuff just isn't possible. I've been depressed for the past 6 years, severely depressed for the past almost year, tried so many meds and dosages and combos (over 20 years of being depressed/anxious off and on), and none of them work for me, have no support in my life besides my therapist, so at least I have her, but my life is otherwise a dumpster fire that can't improve. My family and friends won't suddenly come back and be supportive. This is just the way it is now.

Also I have health issues now FROM being so depressed and anxious and that scares the shit out of me because one issue (now in just the ""pre"" phase) is very serious and I would not be able to deal with it. It would kill me either figuratively or literally or both. Suicide isn't an option for me because I get too scared and chicken out and don't want to scare people by having them find my body. I'm not ungrateful-- I say thank you every day for all I have and things would be far worse if I had no shelter, food, clothes, etc although with my money running out I'm worried about that happening and have no energy to prepare proper meals anyway. 

I've had to put on a happy face whenever I go out and just hold it in when people say rude things to me and disregard my boundaries, since asserting myself doesn't work, but it's getting to the point where I just can't do it anymore. I'm in weekly therapy, but at this point I haven't improved because I keep getting hurt for reasons that don't make sense to me (developing PTSD from being bullied at work, being abandoned by my best friend who recently promised she would never abandon me, etc) and things just keep going downhill. I feel so trapped and don't know what to do. Sigh. I'm too afraid to call a help line because I have a major fear of the police showing up at my door and I'm afraid of going to the mental hospital."
3119,Vent buddy,Does anyone want to just vent to each other with no judgement and no bs? It’s just easier to speak with people who understand what you’re feeling.
3120,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"to put it simply, I feel like literal human refuse. my parents are on my ass about things and every time either of them slightly raise their voice at me I spiral down and here I am trying to make myself cry on my bathroom floor and nothing will come out. I’ve gone through a 3 month period of not feeling any emotion at all and then it came back, and now it’s gone again. I want to feel genuine anger and happiness and sadness but nothing frick frackin happens. im starting to push my friends away again and I don’t know what to do. I want to care, but I can’t."
3121,Lonliness is Legitimately Biologically Unhealthy,"I have learned the difference between being lonely and healthy solitude. Healthy alone time (solitude) is when I choose to be alone. Loneliness stems from when I'm not given that choice. 

I learned that studies show lonliness can be as lethal as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Scientifically being lonely reduces one's immune system for viruses and other complications. That sure is eye opening isn't it? This is me right now"
3122,Will I ever be Happy?,"Yes, I've made a reddit account to rant. It's finals season right now and studying for some meaningless test seems so stupid when I don't even really want to live.

I've started medication, and sometimes I feel okay. When I'm not thinking anything, when I'm not really feeling, I'm okay. But then when I realize things, when I understand and compare my life to others, when I stand in such stark contrast to those who are happy and have a community and friends to support them, I go back into this hole of depression. I only ever have small moments of happiness, moments when I'm with the few people who love me and whom I love. But it's difficult to depend on people when I don't have many friends in the first place and I constantly feel lonely. I see those around me who are always surrounded by people, always being sought, who are liked and known amongst people. I compare myself as someone who is a loner, who has exactly 4 friends to spend time with at school.

It's difficult because it's like at what point is it circumstance or can I change those circumstances. I feel like it's so difficult to make connections or find a community for myself. I thought if I went to an Ivy I would be happy. I went to Harvard, and have never been more depressed in my life. I thought if I were to be in a relationship I would be happy. My boyfriend is so loving and kind and so supportive (albeit long distance). I am still so so sad, I feel his happy life in such stark contrast to mine. He has so many friends, a tight knit community, he likes being at school. I am alone at school. I hate being there. I have nowhere to go. Now I feel like I've become even more depressed because someone else's happiness and better social life have been shoved in my face.

I'm aware this sounds incredibly whiny. I feel like I gave up on trying to make friends or meet people after freshman year. I tried, and many people just weren't interested in extending the relationship. I feel like my current friends are going to become numb to my pain and constant gloominess. I've had many friends this year just stop hanging out with me b/c they got happier and I didn't. I feel like I've become numb to feeling so depressed - I've cried every week this semester. But I'm not crying now. I feel so numb, and I've almost accepted the fact that if I had many things I desired I would still feel depressed. Then what's the point of living right? At this point I'm living for others, because I don't want to ruin my family's life. I'm nowhere near living for myself."
3123,talking,"I decided to talk to someone I trust like everyone always suggests, all it did was make me feel uncomfortable and awkward I wish I just kept it in. I feel stupid when I explain to anyone how I’m feeling bc nobody will understand so what’s the fucking point in talking to them it’s not like they can actually say anything helpful."
3124,Damn... kinda just realized that nobody cares about me or anything I have to say,
3125,Can't seem to escape.,"Everything - from objects I interact with or foods that I eat, to my own tattoos or the phone I'm typing this out on - EVERYTHING is nothing but a reminder of memories I'd much rather not have sticking around. I want to run away. I want out. I need it to stop. It's all so physically exhausting. I can't get far enough away for any sort of relief. I try to distract myself. I try to survive. I'm trying. But nothing I do is good enough. I can't sleep at the right times of the day correctly, I can't maintain a conversation well enough, I'm not whole anymore. I'm only fragments that don't amount to a anything. I'm but a shadow of who I used to know myself as, not that I'd rather be that whole that I remember now. I need an out. I need to get away. I've asked for help. Maybe I haven't asked well enough. I'm too proud to beg. Or, maybe it's not pride. Maybe it's fear. I dont know anymore. I can't remember. I only know how old I am now because I was told just yesterday. I feel like I can't breathe. I feel like I'm being crushed. I can barely keep my eyes open. I'm alone. I'm not lonely, I'm just alone. I feel alone. Most of my family doesn't even interact with me anymore. I don't feel any sort of connection to anyone I can call a friend.... I don't have anyone I CAN call a friend. I'm trying. I'm saying that for me. I need to believe that I'm capable of trying to help myself even in the slightest. But I'm not confident that any of this will even make sense. I'm not confident that this is deserving enough to be read through. I'm not confident in anything pertaining to myself. 

I'm sorry."
3126,At a Christmas Light Event with friends and Took Shrooms,"They seem to be working for everyone, but me. I took them for my depression, but now I feel more depressed nothings happening. Fuck, I really am broken."
3127,"What's the point, if I can't seem to do anything...?","I'm a male close to my mid 20s with no degree and job. I'm like a shut-in stuck in my room watching youtube videos or anime or just reading things related to depression. I want to feel alive but everything I start, I lose interest, and I just go back to watching videos just to fill up the time. I've been using music for a long time to cope with this negative feeling that I now have ongoing tinnitus.

At this point, I can't seem to have the energy for anything because my outlook on life is ""what's the point"". Like it's no use in the end. Having, low self-confidence and self-esteem doesn't help. Everything that should be easy like brushing my teeth, or eating just pissed me off somehow, like it's a waste of time. I don't feel close to no one, not even my family because of childhood experience, and now I view them as an acquaintance who is just there. I can communicate a little with them but I hate it. And I have no friends, or no longer from lack of connection/ communication and event. I just like to somehow disappear from people's lives. I feel worthless in every aspect of life that I feel like I just can't do it.

Maybe, I'm just asking for someone to give me a perfect detailed plan and perspective that I should follow that can help me start feeling alive, loving life even when it's though, and not caring/being afraid of what people think of me. I don't know anymore how I should carry myself through life. I always often feel like ending it all, but I just want to experience a life that's worth living for."
3128,Don’t know how much more of this I can take,"My life is a literal hellhole of anxiety and depression, this last week it’s gotten to the point to where it’s driving me insane.

Please help"
3129,I’m tired and I don’t want to do anything anymore,"I draw for a living, which doesn’t make much by itself. I’ve tried for regular jobs but nothing sticks. It’s not that the jobs aren’t good I just can’t handle them and I don’t understand why. It’s not that I don’t want to work, I do, but when a week goes by I have some of the most severe panic attacks for no reason what-so-ever and I can’t work. It lasts for days.

This makes me feel like a complete failure in that I can’t support myself or my mother or my SO.. this is one of the many reasons why I feel like a waste of air and honestly have no reasons to live.

Sure I have a lot of things I wanna do and I’m honestly afraid of death. I couldn’t kill myself though sometimes I had tried but gave up midway through. I’m scarred pretty bad but only in areas people won’t typically see. I feel disgusting because of it and my SO hasn’t touched me in months and I think it’s because of that. I can’t stop cutting myself though. I need it because it’s the best way to stop myself from freaking out worse. I hate my body so much, I hate how I look, I hate what I am. 

My mom thinks I’m a mental freak but tries to help me the best she can. She doesn’t know how bad it gets and I prefer she doesn’t know.

I want to feel something other than pain and confusion and just all this fucking bullshit in my head. I hate it so fucking much. I haven’t been able to convince myself to leave my house to go see friends or my SO. I haven’t been able to draw longer than 30 or so minutes and all that I make is worthless and nothing. I have so many ideas and hopes and they’re just fucking nothing and shit and I don’t know why I try.

I don’t want to die but I feel like it’s the only way to get away from this. No one will help me and no one cares. Those who may care have no idea what to do and look to me as if I know what to do. What do I do??? I can’t eat, I sleep for days on end and just wish I’d die."
3130,I have more suicidal thoughts,I want them to stop. And they do sometimes when im doing shit. But whenever im alone i just feel so sad and by myself its haunting me.
3131,When People Are Just who they Are so you're Left with All the effort to Continuously change and Be Responsible for everything.,"Have you ever been in a situation where you have a task, a not so good situation that requires a team effort, but people would hang up and not go through the tough times with you and They can easily get away with it because ""that's not their thing, that's just who they are"". And people around would easily agree. 

At the end you take all the responsibility and the blame because you're capable. And you can't be balanced because they already set their expectation for you coz the other person or people are just who they are and they are. 

But when you say you need help, they become deaf or tell you that you shouldve said so in the beggining, but you know they know very well the situation they just unsee. So they have someone like you to always put the blame on."
3132,Today is my birthday and I dread it,"Birthdays are a popularity contest. Always worrying how many people will remember, inviting people you don't really care about and who don't really care about you just so that you don't sit at home alone. 

I think I'm so hard on myself because when I was 13 I imagined 23 to be like how I imagine 33 now at 23. I graduated but I'm still stupid. 

The holidays put a lot of pressure on you too, reminding you even more that you're alone. Both so close together, it's like a double whammy. Worse yet, my boyfriend (who may as well be a stranger) has shown no indication that he's going to reach out today. Even though I reminded him like 3 times. If he doesn't message me, I think I will just leave.

Last year I stuck a match in a slice of cake I got on Uber eats, used it as a candle, then spent all day in bed crying. I told myself this year it wouldn't be the same. Depression sucks, man. I just hope it gets better."
3133,What’s the point anymore,"What’s the point of trying in life anymore, everything I do just doesn’t make me feel any better anymore, I miss those days when I would sit back and talk to people and actually enjoy being part of society but the last 6 years just haven’t been the same, I really have no interest in doing anything anymore nothing really makes me happy and when I’m around people I try not to be a downer so I throw a fake smile and be fake happy, it’s even harder for me to express what is really going on through my head cause I don’t know. It’s a constant thing before I walk to class and and just ask my self why do I keep trying if there is really nothing here for me on this planet. Being sad,depressed and lonely really ruined my “friendships”  within the last 6 years since it’s got to the point where everyone takes me as a joke and just made really think about what did I do wrong and is something seriously wrong with me"
3134,"Home for the holidays, struggling with a depressive episode","I have been doing well with depression/anxiety since I started meds, but I’ve been going through some struggles lately. My relationship has been fading and will probably come to a close soon. Also, my family dog died two weeks ago and I loved her so much. Now that I’m home for winter break the house seems so quiet and I don’t have anyone to interact with except my parents. I feel low energy and it takes a lot of effort to function. I kinda just feel out of it."
3135,i'm in a fucked up situation with no way out and i just need someone to listen to me tell the story.,
3137,I am one thirsty bitch,"Physical affection is deeply engrained into my psyche and it's been over a year since I've had any form of physical contact and its absolutely destroying me.  

I currently dont own a car and the only place for me to meet women my type is about 30 miles away. 

I live in a small village of about 200 people and the only thing we have to do is go to the casino and that only attracts old people. 

I either need to fuck or have a sexy conversation or something.. my libido is on fire."
3138,I need help.,My boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me last week. We lived with each other for 4 years and it's just hard not having someone to wake up to. The first week I was doing surprisingly good but this week it's just hard. I hate feeling sad and emotional. Idk why but I just feel vulnerable and don't like this feeling. I used to self harm before we were together because I didn't like feeling feelings back then either. I just need some support. I already did the red pen method but it just doesn't help.
3139,Really struggling with emptiness,"As the title says. I've been having trouble feeling anything other than sadness/nothing at all. I feel like a robot, just going through the motions of life. I almost feel like I'm not even in control, but simply watching."
3140,Finally getting help...,"These past two weeks have been the worst in my life. My depression has taken every bit of joy out of me. So I finally made an appointment with a doctor to get help. I can’t take this pain anymore. I’m so tired of feeling like I’m worthless and have nothing of value. Let’s hope this is the answer...otherwise, I don’t know what I’m going to do."
3141,Enjoyed a few good hours.,Fucking mistake. Never should of forgotten happiness and comfort isn't a luxury meant for me gods no every time I just get slapped in the face and brought back to reality. Just need to kill myself and get this dumb bs over with
3142,"People are asking the wrong question, they are asking why I am depressed but they should be asking how I endured for so long","28M and have been holding it together pretty well until lately which has caught the attention of some family and friends. I know their intentions are the best, but it irritates me when they say “why can’t you just get up out of bed” or “why can’t you care more”?

Everyday since I could walk I did. I got up when I had no friends in school and was bullied in junior high. I got up from depression when my dad and sister died. I got up from when I had depression from loneliness and overcame drug addiction. I got up when I grew up gay but had no one to talk to. I got up when I had my heart broken. I got up to go to college, work jobs I hated, to go to the gym and push myself. I got up to fight my pride and go to therapy when I was suicidal. I got up after countless years of wishing I had someone just to talk to or care about next to me. 

I just wish they understood that sometimes it’s not that I’m lazy or I don’t care, but just sometimes it’s hard for someone that has experienced so much to get up when they feel like they have done all they can. But they are now fighting the hopelessness in the conclusion that maybe happiness in this life was not meant to be, that I was playing a rigged poker game; and that regardless of all my struggles and efforts, just too many cards were stacked against me. Sometimes it’s hard to get up after days like that."
3143,Another Holiday Season Alone,"It's been quite a year and a half. I did not expect to make it to the end of 2019, at least not outside a mental asylum. I have broken and reformed so many times over the last 18 months. Mental anguish isn't new to me, but this time period has brought with it new understandings of the depths of human misery. It is truly something to discover that the abyss we all hover over daily is much deeper, darker and more terrifying than you previously understood. It is truly something to discover new qualitative dimensions to suffering. And, most of all, it is something else entirely to be brought back from the brink by your first promise of deep friendship and love in years only to have it end in betrayal. 

It is impossible to have contact with real agony and betrayal and not be changed by it (the abyss gazes back after all). But all that has taught me the stupidity of trust, the futility of human life and the real dangers we tightrope walk over thoughtlessly day by day. These are not lessons worth the cost, but they are important ones nonetheless.

Here I am alone once again. And you know what? I'm starting to think that's the best case scenario."
3144,i want to stop,"
i started cutting like a month ago and tonight i’ve realized i made a huge mistake. i’m looking down at my leg right now and it’s torn to shreds. please i don’t want to live like this does anyone have a way i can stop."
3145,I havnt had a hug in 6 months,"My best friend, whenever we would hang out, would tell me she loved me and give me a big hug at the end of hanging out. Then she got a bf and pretty much hasn't talked to me since. She was my beat friend and that all I wanted from her. What I would give to hear she still cares about me and one big hug. It would bring me to tears. My birthday is in 4 days and I have literally no one to share it with. I'm so drunk right now. It's the only way I can feel anything at this point. I'm so dead and numb to everything. I'm to old for this shit. I'm gonna be 26... and my life is just as big of a mess as when I was 20. I've wasted the last 6 years of my life. Why the fuck havnt I ended it yet???????? I want to beg my ex just to speak to me again. My best friend to answer a single text of mine. I miss cuddleing. This is a pretty big low point in my life. I need something to keep going. I know people talk massive shit about people with cats. But omfg they have helped me so much. When I come home and they dont stop purring for 30 minutes... and they love attention from me... it helps"
3146,My last 2 months of life start now,"I have borderline personality disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I'm alone, have no friends, never had a partner and am ugly.

No  matter what good plan I make for my life, it always gets crushed by  reality and the fucking system. Want to move to a new country and work?  Oh, you can't. The immigration laws won't let you. Want to work in that  cool company? 340 applicants and most likely they boss's friend will get  hired. Want to get into cool fields such as data science? Oh, I  can't... the dyscalculia (number dyslexia) won't let me.

I  am going to a trip in Jan 2020 and returning on Feb 20. I will kill  myself afterwards. At least I got to enjoy the last moments I have of  life. At least I will die happily.

I  am done trying to work on my dream job which is one that is away from 9  to 5 and the cubicle. I simply cannot grasp the fact that I have to  work full time in an office, confined... until I retire at 60 and THEN  ACTUALLY START TO LIVE LIFE AND DO WHAT I MISSED OUT ON WHILE I WAS  YOUNG. I refuse to be a slave. Can't freelance because I don't have  marketable skills. Can't get a job because of that too.

As  a 22 year old recent grad with a pointless double major, I might even  end up working as a waitress as I see these happy web developers and  engineers and doctors earn a good salary. My family can't stand me and  I'm a burden to  them. They always complain about how lazy I am and  stuff, invalidating my feelings and struggles, talking as if I didn't  have battles to fight. I just got off from an argument with my mom and  his boyfriend who yells at me like he was my dad. Why was I even born if  I am just taking up space and people bitch about me? Might as well not  be around anymore.

Being a recent  grad with zero future and job even if I sent out 100000 resumes, my  family's pressure and society's crap is pressuring me to the point that  killing myself is the best option.

Here is a post I made that could add more info regarding my situation, it helps: [https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ea3j15/just\_graduated\_college\_without\_job\_prospects\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ea3j15/just_graduated_college_without_job_prospects_and/)

Well,  I will give myself 2 months. If things are not better by March 1, I'll  be done. Knowing me, probably things won't go good. Every time I have  hope, reality crushes it. Wish me luck."
3147,How do you stop fixating on the mistakes you make?,"Every time I make a mistake or fuck up with something I can’t stop fixating on it and for days,weeks, months or years I let it weigh on me. I’m good at telling myself I don’t care about it but I feel like subconsciously it weighs on me. Help"
3148,Lost and confused,"I'm not sure what to do anymore, I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 1 year about a month ago and have been trying to get back out there and find someone new that will spark some joy back into my life and I even found a girl that I really like shes nice funny and genuine something that I really want in a partner but it feels so off after we went on a date, it feels like she's leading me on but I cant seem to bring myself to ask her if it will go anywhere because I'm scared of rejection and its making me extremely depressed and nearly suicidal just thinking about everything, I really wish I didnt feel emotions they cripple me heavily and I struggle to talk to my friends about them because I'm meant to be the strong one after dealing with depression for 11 years. I dont know what to do anymore I want to disappear."
3149,Broke up,"I posted on check in, we broke up. He told me it wasn't working anymore, that he didn't love me anymore (only a slightly bit) needed time for himself. Told me it was mostly me, how I was acting that caused it and had no more chances, it was too late. I think he's making a big mistake. I was his love of his life, his soulmate. We were together for 6 years.

I'm back home with my parents"
3150,Recent depression trigger and I don't know what to do.,"So I'm a 37 yo husband and father of 3. Lately (though I know I've had minor issues with depression in the past all undiagnosed) I've been struggling specially at night. I'll go down the YouTube rabbit hole of my favorite music from my early teens, and just get massive amounts of sad thoughts and feelings of general depression. It's really starting to affect my general Outlook on life, work and personal. It's starting to be a real struggle to put on the mask and act normal, for work, family and life. 

Just not sure what to do really. I don't want to be put on meds. My mother struggled with mental illness then drug abuse through my mid teens until she passed in my mid twenties. I don't want to be like she was at times being completely out of it and such. So I've not even considered seeing someone though I most likely need too. 

I want to be there for my family but it's becoming harder and harder."
3152,life is hell and happiness is only a tease.,"I'm not going to die only because I don't want make other people like my mom sad, I don't want it to go wrong and leave me in pain, and to be honest I'm a coward.  
But i want to die everything hurts.  
I had a girlfriend but we broke up recently because her religion doesn't allow dating only allows marriage but were both to young were only teenagers, and she isn't looking for a relationship right now because of her own problems  
I'm to attached to her to look for anyone else, if a waited a long 10+ years I'd be able to marry her, because that's around when her parents said she would, after shes graduated college and everything.  
I just want a hug, I want to cuddle, I want to kiss  
even when we were together we couldn't because it was a long distance relationship until summer, i confessed through text, looking back on it honestly I regret it, I hurt so much now. She was perfect, she was completely my type and like a female version of me, my best friend too, now talking to her I just kind of feel awkward I don't know what I should or shouldn't say.  


I hate myself for being so unproductive, I want to get back into my hobbies, I want to get back in code and even want to have a career in it one day, but i feel so unmotivated to do anything and end up just watching youtube or procrastinating in some other way to distract myself from the pain. I've been feeling worse and worse by each day, even before I broke up with my girlfriend. I don't know what to do. I'm in a foreign country and people my age don't have any of the same interest, so making friends seems useless being they wont be very good friends. I feel like if I don't become productive my life will be worse when I'm older and have to get a job. I use to be a good kid when i was younger smart and productive, honestly better at math then, more social then too.  


I feel like everything in life is torture even in the smallest ways, similar to the show the good place. I feel like happiness is just a tease, it gets your hopes up and lets them back down again. This belief is only getting stronger. It hurts to exist, and I don't know want to do about it, please help me.  


I feel so lonely, but I cant find any one that I can be friends with, the friends I do have are either back in the states or merely internet friends, meaning either way i can only talk to them online. I'm too attached to my girlfriend still to try to find someone else, if if I did I'd feel so guilty for it, like cheating, if i did I'd still love my girlfriend and that would be weird in the since of dating someone and loving someone else (and to be frank) more, I doubt I'll love anyone as much as I love her.  


I'm sorry for being a bother, i just found this place and thought this was the place to share my feelings."
3153,Is it even worth to try anymore?,"Im feeling worse everyday since last week. I don´t think that my mind is alright. Every night I´m breaking apart and all of that fucking messed up shit is getting worse and worse. I try to be happy over the day but I can\`t anyways, im using the train alot and today I straight up had a breakdown on the station toilet. I don´t get why I should even go on, my GF cheated on me with my best friend, I screwed the friendship with a good friend of mine, im drunk all the time and finally when the booze is empty I´m coming to reddit to cry open my life. My family thinks I´m good, my classmates think I´m okay, even tho none of them rly cares for me. I think everyone just thinks I´m an unbroken person and that nothing can hurt me, some treat me like shit, some ignore me. Am I just to cold to everyone? My thoughts start to scare me, I imagine things happening to me, I imagine doing harm to myself and it feels so good. Is it even worth trying to be happy anymore it just doesnt seem like there is anything that will make this go away, all of the people I loved are gone away, I lost everything, I probably won´t be able to pass my exams. I just don´t know what to do anymore."
3154,Talking to others about depression,"Everything I read tells me that talking to someone close about my depression will help. And I fully accept that as logical and sound. But, the idea of doing so myself is just unthinkable. It's not fear so much, as just  finding the idea so cringe inducing and embarrassing.  I feel like if I tried, that  I would get a few words out and then just go mute while the other person is forced to fill the void with meaningless platitudes. The idea of being pittied repulses me and I honestly feel like I don't want to share this with people.  Has anyone felt like this and found a way round it?"
3155,Thoughts,"I'm 28. I'm killing grad school, have a good job, comfortable life, a few great friends. I have a bright future. I don't know why I'm miserable and have been for ten years. I know how lucky I am intellectually. If it wasn't for meds I think I'd be dead. I've never had a long term relationship. It's so hard to connect with people when you're depressed. I just wish I could understand better why I can't be happy."
3156,I want to kill myself but I don't want my family to have a bad Christmas,"Nothing makes me happy anymore, but I don't want to make anyone sad 

I care about people but I still feel alone, I feel no one cares about myself...I have a pretty Gf and a big family! But no one cares about what I feel...they just like to tell me their problems and they expect me to listen quietly. I've been cutting myself for almost a year and no one notices it, I've been getting drunk alone almost every week, but no one notices it, I've been wishing to die everyday but no one notices it

It's like a prison, solitary confinement

I feel that the affection I get sometimes is just...protocol, my gf will hug me just because it's her job, not that she really cares. She just wants me to be her trophy and to buy her food and stuff"
3157,I found a solution to my depression. DM me if you need help.,
3158,Husband is so depressed and it is affecting me,"My husband had an injury a few months ago and had to go off of one of his ADHD medications as it was interacting with an underlying syndrome that made it hard for him to heal. That medication also helped his depression and kept him motivated. Ever since he got off of it, he just does not smile, laugh, or joke around with me the same. I am so anxious around him now. He just does not respond to me with the same silliness and lightheartedness he has, and I *want to fix it*, but feel like I cant.

It is a horrible combination. His depression spikes my anxiety which makes him more depressed. I have tried to stop asking ""How are you?"" and ""Are you okay?"" as it only annoys him and makes me more anxious since the answer is never good. But, I just cannot catch myself.

We are going to the Dr on Monday, so hopefully he can get back on medication, but I am so scared. What if it doesn't work? I don't want our relationship or him to suffer more than it needs to."
3159,I attempted suicide last night,I’m so ashamed. If it wasn’t for my brother and mom I would be dead. They’ve been nothing but supportive and trying to help me. I’m so ashamed. I didn’t even realize my depression was this bad. I don’t want to die but part of me must. Alcohol fueled it. Just happy to be here writing this. Maybe someone needs to hear that it may be something you think about and think you want to do but you might not necessarily understand how real it is.....
3160,I thought about killing myself today.,"It's weird, I thought it would be some great choice; that I'd weigh up my life at that point and decide whether to finally dive into the icy water and let it take me.

That's not the case, at least as I see it. 

Today I've learnt what rock bottom feels like.. and it's not sad, it's not angry, it's just absolutely nothing...

I've tried to understand depression in the past as I was falling deeper in, trying to understand why death becomes the end goal, but I couldn't see it, why wouldn't you just realise you're at the bottom and decide that the only way is up?

Truth is, I think, when you become this empty, you don't really think at all, you just do it; there's no rationality behind it, no greater meaning, there's just you and the icy water below; and an echo of a former emotion compelling you to jump. 

I didn't jump today; and it wasn't some great courageous decision to live, my body just kept walking. 

I feel like there's always going to be another bridge, one of those might be the final bridge I'll ever walk on. There won't be any thought involved in it, I'll just grab the railing and hop over."
3161,I guess I'm too angry for the r/anger sub,"This probably doesn't belong here and I'll probably get banned here too. That's fine. I don't care. I got banned from r/anger for my first stupid post. All I was trying to do was reach out and discuss if anyone else had managed to (not saying the word here, I guess that's what got me kicked off the other sub) while in a fit of rage. I managed to (not describing anything that might trigger the mods) while snapping my good paintbrushes because I don't deserve nice things after I got into it with a dumbfuck on facebook. I know my anger is related to my depression. I sprial down into a depressive episode, then the tiniest thing sends me into a black rage and I turn my anger onto myself. Now I'm sitting here, my paintbrushes turned to kindling, my dominant hand (not going to say a word that might trigger something) and I can't even talk to anyone about it. I don't know what to do anymore."
3162,"maybe it will help, maybe not","I woke up really low and have just been laying around playing on the phone . . . came across this post on Contagious Laughter that made me laugh so hard I peed a little. I don’t want to get banned for sharing a post in the wrong sub, but will be happy to share the link with any of y’all if you want to give it a try. I do NOT believe the whole “smile and you’ll feel better” thing and I may be miserable again in an hour but, for like three minutes, I laughed. I’ll take that."
3163,Today is my birthday and I have nothing to be sad about; and yet...,"Here I am. Very sad. It’s been this way for the past four years or so. At the end of the day, I feel so desolate. I don’t know why. It’s been an absolutely fantastic day. I’ve been surrounded by my friends and family, I got every gift I asked for and feel loved more than ever. But I get home and I’m just empty. I miss looking forward to this day."
3164,I hate my love language,My love language is physical touch but most of not all of my friends aren’t touchy at all and it leaves me wanting something more and I can never feel loved or wanted because of how I process love. I would never force them to show me love in a way they don’t feel comfortable with I just wish I could find someone that would make me feel loved in the way I can process it easily.
3165,I prefer to be depressed,"Hello everyone 
I've been dealing with depression for the better part of the past three years, it all started when I thought i was happy and life was going well, then my father had cancer, he recovered, then i started having episodes of depression and existential crisis with some anxiety, it all escalated last year when i hit rock bottom as i was seeing everything in my life getting ruined with no reason, in which also i was having a good time and thinking that life is going well, for the past six months I've had opportunities to get away from the misery that i feel, but as soon as i feel anything remotely resembles happiness i start overthinking and ruining everything in my mind until i go back to the depression that i lived in, i can't trust ""happiness"" and whenever something good is happening i have a sound in the back of my head that always says that it's all gonna go away and that, like always, something is going to come up and ruin everything, so i started consciously choosing to be depressed and ruin whatever i have going good in my life.
Does this make any sense?
Has anyone ever felt what I'm feeling?
Going to therapy is not an option as i live in a closed minded community that doesn't believe in therapy as they all say that I'm overreacting and so on and I can't even afford to see a therapist
What can I do?"
3166,recluse,"i keep getting called out as a disappearing act lmao


im #1 escaper from family parties and just in general"
3167,Birthdays in four days and I wish for nothing but to be dead,"I really wish I could celebrate. I finally have someone who cares about me (although I break their trust repeatedly with outbursts) and I finally have a life I’m proud of. I was having a really rough time last year and I thought it was all I the past. If only things stayed like that. Just got up from a 4 hour nap, not refreshed at all. The second I use my brain for anything more than primal urges like eating or drinking I get physically exhausted. I feel this pressure in my head every time I try to answer a math question of even remember my childhood. I’m just so tired. I keep making stupid choices because I can’t think any better. It hurts because I had such a good future. Loving parents, great grades, nothing but potential. I was going to be a neuroscientist. But now I’m nearly disabled. Grades were mid 90s now at 70s. There has to be more than this. I physically feel sick yet my immunity is fine. I really hope I have a tumour or something that can be taken away. Because if not I’ll take myself away

Just yelled at someone and I might be too exhausted to find away to fix the relationship. I think I scared her off. She’s I’ll like me but she handles it way better. If I can’t fix this I’ll be doomed"
3168,I’m looking for friends but I don’t know how to reach out.,"So I have no friends, I’d like to make some. I guess I’ll just tell you all a little about myself and just go from there.

So I’ll be 21 in a few days, Christmas. It’s ironic because I’m atheist. I’m trans mtf, I have really long dark brown, SUPER curly hair. You know those really tight curly fries? Yeaaaa that’s my hair lol. I’m 5’10” so pretty tall. 140lbs

 I’m American, really huge into anything scientific, like....it’s kinda embarrassing how much I dork out over certain things regarding it, only thing I can think of off the top of my head is language. The fact we can communicate with each other just by manipulating our vocal cords and creating certain vibrations in a specific order and pass knowledge from one person to another just fascinates me. 

I love NASA, would like to work there one day, not sure what career role specifically yet but it’s a goal nonetheless. Got really disappointed when the space shuttle program got discontinued back in 2011, crazy to think that was almost 10 years ago. Currently obsessed with the tv show For All Mankind. The provocative nature of the Russians beating us to the moon is intriguing to me. It’s fun to speculate what would have happened had the soviets gone to the moon. Which bring me to my next nerdy topic thing, I like alternative history, for the same reason. The butterfly effect is fascinating to me and it’s crazy to me how one simple action can change history drastically. The same way as if you were to launch a projectile and just change it’s initial trajectory just by a single degree or two and by the time it stops it will be potentially miles off of what the target was, depending on how far it travels. That’s why I love science and everything NASA and the ESA do, you have to be so extremely precise with everything for the mission to succeed. Anyway I need to stop myself or I will legit spend just an hour on this.

That’s another thing, if it’s a topic I don’t find myself interested in, I don’t talk much and can be a bit awkward but if it’s something I like or find interesting, I will talk way, WAY too much lol like I don’t shut up. So don’t feel bad if you need to tell me to shut up lol.

I’m unemployed so it leaves me with way too much free time, I’m trying to get a job but haven’t found one yet. I do suffer from depression because of it but don’t worry or go oh god, never mind and leave. Tho I may have depression I’m generally a pretty optimistic person. Shit has to be pretty far in the gutter before I’m like “yeaaaaa I’m maybe we’re fucked”. I refuse to quit, call it stubborn if you like but I’d rather fail and not have completed the task or whatever it may be, than to throw in the towel and give up. So much so that I will still try to salvage painfully obvious lost causes, I just refuse to give up. 

I try to be as selfless as possible and it gets me into situations where I suffer just to make someone else happy. I’d rather be the one in pain if it means I can make someone else happy. 

And yea I’m just gonna stop there cuz jfc I’ve been talking for way too long 😂 just message me or something tell me hey or whatever see where it goes from there. Byeee 💕"
3169,This is gonna be a rough month,Hi I just finished the semester at school and idk I feel like it’s gonna be a rough month for me. I’m depressed but I can manage and school even though I hate it kept my mind off it a little and kept me occupied. I work a shitty part time job and I don’t really have any real friends I mean I do have one really good friend I’ve made from here but I don’t want to pester her with all my shit. I feel like this lack of time I waste is gonna mean more time with my head and idk if I’m prepared for that I mean I can go to the gym or play Xbox but the gyms only like a hour or two and I get bored of Xbox pretty fast. Just wanted to let ppl know how I feel I guess lol. I’m not looking for anybody to msg me or anything cuz I don’t want to get ghosted which is a unfortunate thing that happens way to often to ppl here. I appreciate if you read this though and good luck to you guys and your situations.
3170,Not sure if this is depression,"I've had period's where I feel as though nothing matters, no meaning in life. Basically everything is mehh. I've also at times thought that life is pointless and I even nonchalantly told my mom I don't think I'll be alive in five years time and I honestly meant it.

Would this be depression?  The feeling of utter pointlessness and hopelessness."
3171,Play,"Feel terrible after acting like I was fine earlier with family. I tried to be as normal and responsive as possible. I hate giving them a sense that I am getting better. I am only getting worse. A moment of me smiling or chatting doesn’t mean that I don’t want to slit my wrists. I’m just annoyed at myself for even trying to put on a fake face. I hate having to remember that I exist or that other people acknowledge me. I feel so not part of this world mostly because I don’t have friends or never had someone to care about me. I’m turning 21 soon and I am a loser. No one even looks at me. I feel disgusted with myself. I’m so used to feeling this way. Without fail, something bad will happen that will remind me that I don’t mean anything."
3172,Bit of a bad moment i guess.,"I really dont know where else to write or speak right now. This should maybe go in relationship advices tho. 

I had long time depression (about 10years) but last three years has been good to me. Found motivation and passion again in my life. 

But this year is bit bumpy. I have GF for about7years for now and we live together,  relationship has been bit of a decline, at least for me, shes still happy i guess. 

Then i went volunteering for under a year and met another girl whom i really liked. We started ""dating"" or just to be together and in my mind it was good and balanced relationship. But it wasnt easy. 
Close to the ending she found boyfriend for herself, it was hurtful for me but i still had GF of my own so who im to judge(Even though we promised to be for each others only for our volunteering Time). 
But i got jealous, i said( atleast i think i said) that im ready to leave everything behind for her, if she just wanted. She Said no, too complicated as i have GF. Still she chose to have long distance relationship and plans to meet him. 

Now that im back home again. Without school or a Job. No activities i feel My depression to creeping in. I find no joy on things that used to help me such as playing games. Getting Job or a school really scares me now. I dont know if i want to be with My GF anymore. 

Im just scared, tired and heartbroken."
3173,I was 6 pounds of pressure away from suicide.,"My life has not been an easy one. It hasn't been simple, nice, or even enjoyable most of the time.

My mother died of cancer when I was 14. 3 months later, my father took his own life. He couldnt fight his demons any longer.

I was sent to live with my grandmother. Who was nothing but kind and caring and supportive. But by that time, the damage was done.

I spent my entire high school career being mercilessly bullied. Day in and day out. It was a never ending cycle that I came to expect.

I joined the military when I turned 18. The United States Marine Corps specifically. It seemed like a good idea to get away from this godforsaken town, with these fucking idiots living in it.

My first enlistment went well. I was promoted to Cpl. Had a deployment. Overall a very enjoyable experience. 

I'm now on my 7th year of my contract. 25. Broken. Depressed. I feel like hell has become my reality. I lost my girlfriend to a car accident last week. Today is her birthday. The day on which I was going to propose.

Four and a half hours ago, the only friend I had growing up, went to boot camp with, and got stationed with, took his life. He put a gun in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. Much like my father did.

Immediately after the phone call with his mother, I proceeded to load my glock 21, and put it in my mouth. 6 pounds of pressure is all it takes to pull the trigger. 

I sat there for what must have been 10-15 minutes. Until I realized what I was about to do. I unloaded my glock and hurled it across the room. Trying to get it as far away from me as possible.

I realized that I couldnt give up. I cant give up. I won't back down. And I wont quit.

I'm not taking the route my father took, I refuse to take the route my best friend took. I cannot, and will not take my own life.

That being said, I dont know where to turn. My literal only friend killed himself. My parents have been dead for what feels like an eternity. My grandmother passed away last fall. The love of my live, the spark that set my soul ablaze is no longer living.

I have myself. And only myself. And i must continue to push on. Somehow."
3174,Venting,"I am 17. Although I fit in with adults much better than I do with teenagers. 
I am in trade school for diesel tech, while also working as a diesel mechanic about 30 hours a week and put a tremendous amount of time into online diesel engine training courses at home. That pretty much sums up my day to day life.  
Just about 2 months ago, I found out that my girlfriend was pregnant with my baby. That was the first time in my life I have ever felt true happiness. I didn't give a fuck what anybody in the world thought. I was happy.
For about 2 weeks.
I was at school, when my girlfriend called me and told me she was having a miscarriage. I then had to go to work right after school. I saw her for about an hour that night and cried it out. Then I went home to my parents telling me they don't want me to see her anymore, or talk to her at all, now that there was no baby in the picture. I'm 17, so I really don't have too much say. 
I then told my parents about my emotional state, about how my whole life that I have been depressed and emotionless. And that this baby was the only thing that ever gave me happiness. They themselves did not show any care, except for putting me back into counselling. I was then diagnosed with depression and ocd. I have been taking 20mg of citalopram for about 3 weeks. And I have become even more depressed and emotionless.
All I can think about is how I wish that I could still have my baby. 
I have always been suicidal, ever since I was like 8, 9 years old. I am getting closer and closer to the edge, where every day that passes, suicide begins to seem more and more rational. 
I suffered brain damage as a baby and it had rewired my brain. I am still a normal person, as you could guess by me getting honor roll in my diesel technology class and being a pretty damn good diesel mechanic at only 17 years old, and maintaining a job as a mechanic. I'm a rapper and have been told I write some of the best lyrics anybody has ever heard, I have gotten quite a bit of recognition for my music, given that it is very depressing and violent music, such as performing in many big cities around me and getting recognized by many musicians that I look up to, as well as making a little money from my music.
So it's not that I'm mentally retarted or anything. I feel as if my brain damage has rewired my brain to feel this way, as I have always felt this way for as long as I can remember. 
I do not know where to go from here. I don't even know why I'm sharing this with no intention. Possibly hoping somebody can relate (not hoping that anybody would ever feel this way, just hoping that if they do, they could see they aren't alone) and possibly have a conversation, or anybody that had gotten out of a similar situation could give a helping hand."
3175,I Don't Know What to Think or Do,"Hiya, I'm a bit new. I'll admit that I haven't used Reddit much at all. This post may be a bit of a mess, but I really need to get this all off of my chest.

I'm 18, currently in high school. I'm taking 6/8 classes currently, and am stressed out of my mind. I've spent most of my free time working on homework, and have started to find that I don't even enjoy doing anything that I used to. I've also found myself zoning out a lot more than usual, while working on homework, talking to people, or similar. Most of my classes are normal classes, except my AP art class.

On top of all of the work I've been assigned, some of my teachers haven't exactly been the nicest to me. I can only really think of a few examples at the moment.. They aren't all 100% related to my issues, but I think they may be contributing. Feel free to skip over them.
- I had turned an art project in a day late because I was sick the day before. We had just recently went to a different state, and I'm assuming I caught something there. This teacher assumed that I was trying to get more time, and proceeded to dock me 10%. It doesn't seem like a huge deal, but I had worked so hard to get that assignment in on time. I tried to talk to her about it, and she went on about how most workplaces won't give you sick pay. After this I tried to ask her why another assignment had been docked. I had drawn this hawk/rattlesnake hybrid in grasslands lunging at another combined creature I made prior. She said that it wasn't lunging, and that the background wasn't giving her enough info (I poured my heart and soul into this piece). I'm convinced that she didn't look into the piece, or considered what I may have been trying to do.
- I had made a video for my American history project, and was trying to set up to present. I was struggling to set up, and tried to ask her about the document I shared with her because it has a link to the video. I was thinking that would be better than logging in to my google account and maybe messing her stuff up (because I have a tendency to mess up under pressure). She has misunderstood, and was going through another stack of unrelated papers looking for mine. I told her that wasn't it and that I would figure it out, and she had ended up throwing the stack of papers on the floor. Then, while I was setting up, I heard her very sarcastically say ""really?"" I had thought she was talking to me, and told her that I didn't log out of her account.. To which she responded, just as or more sarcastically, ""not you, [name].""
&gt; I have the same teacher for world history and American history. I was going to be missing on of the final days for one of the classes, and needed to remember to talk to her about it. I have a bad memory, so I wanted to mention it during a period she gave us to work because I knew I was going to forget. When I mentioned it to her, she sarcastically said ""how's about we talk about it during that class?"" I forgot during that class, and wasn't able to talk to her about it.

This little stuff seriously got to me, and I've found myself crying over some of the little things my teachers have said and done.

I also feel like my class tends to avoid me. I'm a bit quiet, and I have slightly different interests than everyone else. I'm not sure if I've done something to make them dislike me or what. I'll try to talk to people, and things will seem fine until they start to ignore me. I've found myself sitting by myself in some of my senior classes. I'm not getting bullied, but I don't understand why people are ignoring me. I've had people gossip about me in other schools in the past, so I can't help but feel like that could be the case now.

The friends that I do currently have I'm unsure about. Two of them only hang out with each other now, and will occasionally talk to me. However it feels like they've both sort of pushed me away. The other friend who is still around is a compulsive liar. She had told me that another student had said she wanted to kill me, and that she wanted to stab me. This was partially true, but blown way out of proportion. I had gotten the principal involved and they had investigated. My friend had told me that I was blowing things out of proportion and creating stress for the whole friend group (which I wasn't?)..

I do have a few online friends, but I feel like I've made myself unwelcome. Within that friend group, I have a boyfriend (woo LDRs..). He hates listening to me vent, so every now and then I'll try to talk to some of the others about my issues. It.. Seems like that's upset people, so I'm going to try to avoid that in the future.

On top of everything else, I can't seem to eat right. I never feel hungry, I'm constantly stressed and anxious, and it's fantastic. My mom is a nurse, and keeps telling me that I'm distracting myself from eating, and that my computer is the issue. The thing is that I just don't feel hungry. Everyone else I know who uses their computers as regularly as I do feels hungry, but I just don't seem to normally. My mom keeps blaming this on me, and refuses to really listen. It always turns into a fight.

I've tried to talk to her about my stress and anxiety, and she says that it's all normal. I feel like it isn't, because I think it's causing a lot of the issues I'm having currently. She refuses to let my talk to a doctor or therapist, or at least has been strongly advising against it. She's a Christian, and has been telling me that I just need to pray about it.

My parents are also divorced. I've had to deal with either parent talking crap about the other, and being told to keep it to myself. I'm told to keep a lot of stuff from the other parent in general, and I've gotten to this point where I just let everything bottle up over time.

There's so much stuff that's been building up over time and I feel like I'm starting to become depressed. I don't know exactly how all of this works, and I've been told that I'm not so many times. I've been told that everything I'm going through is normal but I can't help but feel like it isn't.

If I've broken any rules here, I'm so sorry.. I made sure to read through them all, but I'm never sure. Thank you for reading my mess of a post."
3177,College break is awful for me,"Do any other college students feel like their depression gets 100x worse the instant any sort of break starts? I just began winter break and I'm so down in the dumps. I have no motivation to do anything I enjoy, despite having all the time in the world to do it.

Last summer was the same case. I came back from college and just did a whole lot of nothing for 3 months because I couldn't bring myself to do much.

I don't have many good friends in my hometown anymore. I still have friends, but the ones I made at college are just on the same wavelength. I feel empty without them, idk how to explain it. I love my parents but being away from my friends and schoolwork just destroys me I guess. Any advice on getting through these 5 weeks?"
3178,"I look at my friends having lives full of things, and I feel so shitty.",I’m stuck in this comparison trap. I only see the highlight reel of people around me. there is so much they do in their lives that I feel so inferior and shitty. I start thinking I’m worthless and useless. Not a person worth dating or befriending. And it ***wrecks*** me. I want help/advice in fighting these feelings.
3179,I’m honestly convinced that no one actually cares,"People can say “I’m here for you” or “you can talk to me whenever” but usually that’s just them trying to be nice. No one cares. My friends know I’m suicidal. They don’t check in on me. Not even a “hey what’s up” - as a matter of fact - no one really reaches out to me ever about anything. Maybe it’s me. Am I too ugly? Too depressed? I try my best to be the absolute best friend I can be - to listen, to be there for people. But no one would ever do that for me.

Even in subs like this - the mental health related subs where I thought maybe people would be kind and understanding. I post about how I’m struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts and have gotten responses saying “no wonder your lonely” “you’re insufferable” et cetera when all I’m trying to do is express how I’m feeling and what I’m going through. 

I’m in college and honestly, I hate it. I hate my life. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I’m done. I keep thinking about death and killing myself and it’s painfully exhausting. I want to be happy again. I want people in my life who actually care wether I kill myself or not. But I’ve never had that. I’m done."
3180,"I know what I have to do, but I have absolutely no motivation",I have responsibilities and I know what I need to do and work on to get better. But I have absolutely no motivation. I see it but can't do it. I have little interest in anything and I can't find motivation to do almost anything.
3181,I wish I could be the person people think I am,"I’d love to actually be the person I show to other people. I’d love to actually be funny, confident, charismatic, and happy instead of a sad, self hating piece of shit. It’s never going to happen, but it’d be nice."
3182,Need some help,"Hey guys, Ik this is small potatoes compared to what most of y’all are going through but I kinda need some help and to vent. I’ve always struggled with self image and shit. I’ve used sex as a coping mechanism but it’s not really working anymore. I just overall feel like a worthless human. Even though I have friends I feel like nobody actually likes me. To the same effect I can’t seem to find any intimacy with the people I like romantically. People will be down to fuck but as soon as I feel romantic affection it seems like they want nothing to do with me. So, yeah, if you read this thanks for listening to me vent and if you comment then thanks in advance for the advice. Best wishes to everybody struggling."
3183,I don't know what to do anymore,"I feel trapped inside my own life, like I just exist, I've attempted suicide numerous times and it just never works. I've overdosed seven times, including one two days ago. I've attempted to go somewhere high up and jump but there always seems to be someone around to stop me. I hate my life, I was sexually abused growing up which affected my childhood, education and relationships. I've got no future was let go from the only job I've ever had last year. The only thing I think could make me happy is if the person I'm absolutely on love with loved me back but they've made it clear they don't. As the title stays I just don't know what to do anymore. I seem unable to kill myself so I'm just doomed to exist in self hatred and anxiety until I die.

If you've made it this far thank you, it would be nice to know someone hears me."
3184,"I can’t be the only one, right?","Every time I get invited to social events by fellow friends I always go whenever I am at these events I feel even lonelier than I do when I am home by myself for days. I feel so remote and like a such a bother, I wonder why I come, is it just pity? Ever since my life got messed by my incurable medical condition 10 years ago, i see all my friends lives progressing (marriage, getting their own houses, and general happiness) and a I feel like I been just living in pain until I die. 

I been trying so goddamn hard to actually progress and nothing happens. I been single and haven’t been a member of the opposite sex in 10 year. Everyone I tried to seek advice from just keeping saying I’m not trying hard enough. Yet they really have no idea. I should of die multiple times from my condition but no one let me finally rest from this pain. I lost over 5 bag of blood and had seizures and they kept me alive. Why am I just here to suffer, physically/mentally/and I’m not even spiritual person but I’m pretty sure there is a higher being just mocking me. I just need to accept the fact that I will never be anything and die alone, with nothing in a random alleyway."
3185,My tendencies,You guys ever have the tendency to think your hated no matter what? You can say the nicest thing to me and I would think you hate me. It's something I know i will never fix.
3186,pregnant and im alone,"After i have the baby i am going to kill myself i think, due in march

father of child was the love of my life

i cant feel anything good anymore. he doesnt want me to keep the baby and he doesnt want me to have even an open adoption 

im so alone and the pressure to give away the baby the only comforting being that has helped me with the loneliness is too much

if i keep the baby im robbing them of a father he says

i just want to die now but id harm the baby and i could never do that"
3187,Let me tell you my story which probably nobody will read.,"So yeah, my whole life in my opinion is just shit. I don’t even know, what holds me here. 

My childhood was cleaning the house and taking care about 20 horses, every day. 
No matter how clean the house was, when my mom came home, she instantly made it dirty again. Seriously... I never became any love from both of my parents. My mother punished me every day, like hitting me with kitchen utensils and broomsticks and a whip. Till they broke or I was crying of pain. I had almost no friends and got bullied in school because I always came late or was „ill“. Then actually I was cleaning the stable. When I had pain somewhere or I really got ill, my mother just said „don’t cry and stfu“. 
Then, with 16 I was brave enough to go to the youth office and they brought me to an children’s home which wasn’t that better either. 
I don’t have any contact to my mother and I don’t want to. The rest of my family never call me or something but complains about me that I never call them or come to visit them. Which isn’t true. 
I failed in Highschool (I guess that’s the name for it in English?) and wasn’t able to study. 
Which was also the fault of my extremely jealous ex gf. She wanted to kill herself once because I needed a brake. 
Then my next ex gf cheated on me. 
Now I’m in education with depressions. Sometimes I can’t get out of my bed and go to school. I talked to my instructor and told him about my depression. It’s a bit weird now when we talk to each other... 
Nobody in my company really talks to me and for me it feels like I’m an alien to them. Idk 
Im totally stressed out right now because everyone is complaining about me or don’t want to talk to me more than just a few sentences. 
I just feels like nobody likes me and I’m feeling totally ugly. 

Sometimes I notice of myself when I did something, I’m kinda seeking for confirmation from someone to be thankful. Like parents should give you in the childhood you know?... 

I don’t know how to go on anymore."
3188,Feeling so sad,
3189,If you are at the end of your rope consider using Psilocybin.,"I took 5 grams, ate all my vaped weed, smoked two bowls and sat in silent darkness for about an hour. I talked to the mushrooms and set an intention to be a better man and asked them to help me figure a way out of wage slavery. I sat in a dark room blindfolded with earplugs. I don't remember much of what I experienced but some of the things I can recall were scary faces learing at me, strange noises, a feeling of a malovent presence, and a seperate feeling of an alien presence. At the same time though I felt like I was safe.

After that I went to the next room and laid down with my girlfreind and watched tv. She is the love of my life and we had a great relationship. I recall that some people on the tv looked like aliens and others were artificial like robots. At some point I blacked out but continued to talk to her. The mushrooms told her that I have been going to massage parlors and recieving handjobs and that I have urges to have sex with other women. She forgave me and we moved on. 

Since that day I have been microdosing and I feel like a normal person for the first time in my life. I am no longer suicidal. I am optimistic, more social, and more sympathetic to others. I feel connected to other humans. I am working on starting my own buissness that will inrich myself and others. I am repairing burnt bridges. I now have goals and dreams.

I have been a deadbeat dad. I have been ducking my child support. I have a son I haven't seen or spoke to in well over a year. A few nights ago I reached out to his mother and asked her for forgiveness. It was so hard but we ended up talking and laughing for three hours and she forgave me. When I have my life together I will reconnect with my him.

Today I went to a massage parlor and was offered oral sex. I didn't turn it down because I wanted it. Then I asked for sex and  I got it. I am beyond ashamed. I am ashamed that this will break my girlfreinds heart and destroy our relationship. And I am ashamed for participating in human trafficking. Afterwards I thought maybe I could do some good and asked her if she was a victim of this and if she needed help. She laughed and assured me she wasn't but I have my doubts. I recognize that I am a sex addict and will be seeking professional help. 

I want to be open and honest. I want to be true to myself and others about what I am. I want to get better.

Psilocybin for me added something that I have been missing my entire life and I feel whole now. It's like coming out of a fog into the sunshine. I believe it is natural medicine and not a drug. If you decide to go down this path I encourage you to do some research on your own and make sure you have a trip sitter.

This is my testimonial and I hope it does some good.

Tonight I will show this post to my girlfreind."
3190,Why does it hurt to lose friends?,"I’ve been cut off by 3 of my friends over the course of the last 3-4 months and it’s slowly started to hurt more and more. I haven’t spoken to or hung out with another person in months the only people I’ve spoken to are those I see for brief moments at work or imaginary internet people on reddit which aren’t real bonds. 

The longer I’m isolated the more it hurts and the more it hurts specifically that my friends I cared about no longer wish to have me in their life. I don’t know why it hurts but it does, I thought time was supposed to heal wounds but the longer it goes the worse I feel."
3192,WHAT'S THE BIGGEST RISK ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER TAKEN?,"Karaoke on Bourbon Street sober

   \- This was after I arrived to New Orleans looking for a newfound sense of adventure and damn near had a bout of anxiety and loneliness take over me my first night as I felt like the one guy in the party asking himself ""What the hell am I doing here?"" So I decided to stay in a bar for 3 hours on my last night before deciding to sing a tune....and it was bad...really bad...and as soon as I got back to my AirBNB, I cried...and cried...and cried, muttering to myself how embarrassing I was to not just people but myself. Over time, it becomes a whatever experience. And encouraging to do more.

I want to believe that risks make us stronger. Any risks from you all? Sharing these stories and pains you all have acquired is a risk in themselves. Kudos, and peace my fellow blues!"
3194,I just need a little encouragement,"Hi, I'm not really sure how to go about this, but I'm really just needing someone that understands to just lift me up a little bit. I'm your typical ""raised a certain way"" guy that sucks up his feelings and works through the crap. Opening up about my feelings isn't really my forte, so that why I'm here, instead of going to friends or family. I hope someone can relate, cuz I'd love to have someone that understands let me know I'm not alone"
3195,Seeing a psychiatrist on Monday,"Should be either a step towards feeling a little less fucking horrible/being slightly more functional, or a step towards dashing whatever shrivelled hope I haven't yet managed to stamp out. I'm scared. What if I'm not treatable? What if there is no 'better'? What if this isn't something happening to me, it's just me? I don't know where I'm supposed to end, and the depression begins. If you took it away, is there even enough left of me to form a whole person? How much of me is really me? Or is it all me. Is this some parasitic darkness feeding on a normal, healthy person beneath, or am I just broken inside? Or am I just brokenness, you fix me and there's nothing left"
3196,Ketamine wont change me (1st infusion on Monday),"At best it might make me not depressed. It wont make me attractive or beautiful. It wont do my laundry for me. It wont make me stop fucking up at work. It wont help me have a family. It wont make me lovable. 

I think I just need to end my suffering after the holidays. I dont want to make it to my birthday 6 weeks from now. I give up."
3197,Everything I say is putrid and annoying,People hate everything I say. I hate everything I say. I should just shut the fuck up forever and stop being a fucking embarrassment.
3198,My brain won’t cooperate,"All my brain wants to do is jack off, play video games and sleep. I’m not fit for anything in this world. I can’t get a fucking girlfriend this way, but my brain doesn’t understand, it wants one anyway. It doesn’t want to try. It’s angry, it’s a fucking bitch. It frankly doesn’t care about anything. It doesn’t feel motivated. I’m doomed. I hate myself. So many things are wrong with me. I can’t change. I’m fucked. Fuck it all. Fuck you all. I was raised wrong. I want love, but it’s impossible."
3199,My mouth hurts because of the mint...,"So, it has been a few days since I last brushed my teeth, I have had way longer periods between brushes, but now I do usually go about at least 4 days or so without brushing, brush either morning or night and then don't brush for another 4 or so days, unless I can get the energy or encouragement from my partner to brush.
I feel bad for my partner that I feel unable to take care of myself in the seemingly most simple ways, but it is just so hard sometimes and I don't understand how or why really...?
Anyways, I finally managed to brush my teeth just now before bed and like many other times it feels like the minty taste or something from the toothpaste is burning (in) my mouth... is this common among you or is it just my oversensibility?"
3200,Talking to my depressed friend about my depression,"I feel so guilty, but I've no one else I feel comfortable enough to talk to about it. I don't know if I'm making it worse for him, but I can't bear it.
I saw him cut through his arm with his nails during school time once, and I kept quiet. I only told his mom about it through text messages that night.
I feel like shit, but this makes it worse.
I envy his life too. For a multitude of reasons I will not get into.
I don't know the point of this post, I just needed to get some of it out of my chest, I guess."
3201,lol I'm a terrible person,"I lied to my best friend that I'm getting help because they're convinced I'm depressed, just because I called them up once about feeling suicidal and mentioned how I feel worthless multiple times and I have terrible mechanisms to cope with loss. I can't be depressed because I'm happy sometimes! I think...   
Well, I mean, I feel comfortably neutral sometimes. Pshht, who really, *honestly*, feels happy, amiright? Right?  
Well, anyways, they think I'm seeing a therapist and taking meds, and now I feel more trapped than ever. I can't talk to my family about being depressed - that would just make them sad and think it's their fault. Mom's already going through a rough spot with mental illness trash, so talking to her would make it worse. Can't talk to my friend because they freak out every time I bring it up, AND I'd be caught in a lie. Don't want to see a therapist because then my mom would find out and.... it's just rough man.  
AND SO, I came here to a site where my opinion is lost to a sea of other opinions to shout into it's void about my problems and how terrible I feel, which makes me feel even worse because I think I'm as sad as people who ACTUALLY suffer from depression and that's just trashy. Then I feel bad, then I feel worse, and it's just a vicious cycle with no outlets because I can't find any except the hollow void of the internet."
3202,Im suicidal,I hate my life i no longer care about things and I commit self harm a lot and considering hanging myself
3204,"hey, long time no talk","Since my the day I had to decide between suicide or life and today, there have been a lot of up and downs and it’s really hard. I’m happy to be alive but it just feels unnatural. Like my expiration date has passed. I don’t feel like my actions have consequences and just feel like an NPC in other people’s lives."
3205,Girlfriend cheated on me with best friend that I told my issues with her about to. I’m 17. Severely depressed.,"I am 17. My best friend, I didn’t know broke up with his gf. He convinced me to tell him bad things about my gf that I was mad at her about. He told her all these things and behind my back they fucked and are now dating. I am shaking and throwing up."
3207,Is dusk the worst time of day for anyone else?,
3208,My friend is depressed and I want to help,"I found out that a friend of mine is depressed. I am the only one who knows and she doesn't want any help (therapy, telling her parents or anybody else etc.). I don't know how to convince her of getting help.
Also if you have any tips on what I could do to help her pls tell me."
3209,Feeling Dissatisfied,"I have made this account today. I need assistance because there are a lot of things that really make living a bit of a struggle. I hate complaining on this and I won't say anything untrue. Life is dull and uninteresting. There's no new excitement in my life, despite action I take. It's a dissatisfaction I feel but it won't stop pestering me either. I have an abrupt change to a mood that feels honestly very sedated and boring. It's either bland or sad for that matter. I won't make a deal of it either but existentialism is a very big problematic aspect of my life. I've acknowledge many different sides of the argument; I understand there's no point, Just enjoy it. I understand you shouldn't waste your life being sad, just be happy. It doesn't suffice. There's just a unhappy feeling in me that arises by random. I hate therapy and I hate medication. The rational part of me KNOWS suicide should never be the answer, but I feel irrational.  Is there really a purpose or point to not be dissatisfied? Apologies for being brief."
3210,Anyone else wish they could just be happy being alone?,I’ve come to realize that the small group of friends that I do have only hang out with me out of pity. I made the mistake of telling people that I’m depressed only to realize that when you do that you can’t tell if someone is your friend because they generally like you as a person or if they just want to keep you from killing your self. Lmao life is a joke. The punchline is living it.
3211,What does edgy really mean,"There’s a lot of people who would tell you that a teen who’s depressed just want attention, if he tries to kill himself it’s just because he wants to be « edgy » if he do self harm it’s for the same reason. That it’s all just the age and that they are just piece of shit who are faking 


And then they become adults and everyone will say that they are just sad because of x reason or if they killed them self it’s because they dropped out of school. 

Why does no one take depression seriously even if it’s the first cause of death among the 12-25. Why does even some people who are depressed says that others who clearly seems depressed aren’t because they are young or because they aren’t as fucked as them. Why does even us have to hate each other. Why do we do that. Yeah there’s probably some people that fake it but seriously who would want to suffer that much, to lose friends, enthousiasme about things we used to like, energy, starting to fail school, trying to kill yourself and all the other shit. 

So why the fuck are people calling a suicidal teen an edgy teen. Why the fuck does every one keep telling me that it will go when I’ll grown up when I don’t even kwon if I won’t kill myself the next day because I feel like a shit and that since I’m fucking seven"
3212,Relapsing depression,"So I have had major mild depression off and on for several years it has definitely been really bad but once I finally got rid of my abusive ex boyfriend and started dating someone loving and wonderful I have been better. Still a few sleepy and empty feeling days but not as bad as it has been. But it’s back and I just want to cry. 

I was excited for putting up Christmas stuff, I was excited about losing weight, I was excited about my new job, I was excited to be feeling good and happy and normal again. I thought I did it, I thought I won. But it is back and it isn’t fair. I don’t want to do this to my boyfriend, I want to be able to keep my house clean and cook food with him, I don’t want him to have to pick up my slack, it isn’t fair.

All I want is to lay around and sleep and sleep and sleep. I’m back to drinking pop and eating junk for energy/any good feeling but then I feel even worse. I gained the few pounds I lost. Even now I am just sitting on the couch when there is so much to do. My guy has been so sweet, taking out the trash, plugging in my phone and making sure my alarms are set when he come home from work and I’m asleep, giving me lots of love and working hard to make me smile and feel loved but when he is gone I just go right back to sleepy emptiness.

I am going to try to get into therapy at work but I don’t know when I will be able to get in. I just feel like such a failure, I was doing so well and had so many things I was excited for that now I just can’t even muster the energy to do.

If anyone has any advice or anything, it is appreciated."
3214,Why am I like this,"Maybe it was the ex? Maybe it was the constant sexual roleplaying or maybe it was the nudes.. I'm hypersexual and when I get horny it's just too intoxicating, I wasn't like this before I became a furry.
Now hold your horses (wink) I'm not saying all furries are bad, I'm just saying I didn't get the good batch.

I'm still a furry, I have someone I love, I still feel the claws of role play in my groin god it was just too damn hot but I drowned in it.. If you're going to be a furry please be smarter than me. 
Sorry for the rant being everywhere but better here than to my ""friends"".
What am I gonna say, ""a furry ruined my life?"""
3215,Ive got too much to live for but not enough to want to,Fml
3216,Called everyone I knew.,"I don’t want to go into detail. Someone physically beat the shit out of me and I called all of my friends, I do not have family to rely on. Nobody could help me. I took 4 Benadryl and slept for 17 hours. I am so suicidal. I sat in the shower and cried, now I am just sitting here feeling numb. I am supposed to work 12 hours tomorrow and Monday and I am hurt and not healthy mentally. I don’t think I can do this anymore. I don’t have anywhere to go or support. I am scared of myself and I think maybe it is a sign that things just can’t get any better from here. I feel like giving up. I don’t want to fight with myself anymore, this is so pathetic and sad... I am sorry for everyone who even had to read this."
3217,I've got too much to live for but too much to care about to not live,"Im in a limbo where I wouldnt care if I died but never would do anything to myself. Its just a shitfest I dont want to be in anymore. Im happy, I can have a great evening, give me one moment I'm alone, i feel like a lonely piece of shit. Fml"
3218,Drinking on my own,"I don't exactly beg people to drink with me, but i imagine it would be less lonely, a little more fun.

I guess i should be happy they're spared of having me there.

After all, it's not like i push forward to be a somebody in anyone's life..

The end results are only to be expected.

When i am alone..

I just become depressed, and i in a way give up to ever being something more.

It's my own fault. No blame to anyone but myself.

Still.. What's it like to have.. Friends and family."
3219,I've spent ten years practically socially isolated,"Sure, I've spent a couple days here and there with friends. Half of those friends aren't even my friends anymore. Sure, I have a couple friends on social media (about 30). But for the most part, I've spent ten years alone. I've always felt like no one could really understand the traumatic events that have occurred in my life, and I'm pretty sure that's true. Every day I just wish my life would end, to end this isolation and suffering. People always tell me, just keep your head up, and all this soothsayer positivity that never actually helps me. Probably wasting my breath here, but I felt like venting. This is not a ""pity me, woe is me"" post. I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I just hate my life and wish it was over."
3220,My memory is broken,"Whenever I think of anything else than how I suck at everythin I do, or that nobody really likes me in any way, for more than 10 minutes at a time, my brain just stop everything to go back to the negative thoughts. (It's kinda like if the not negative thoughts were a pencil, and the negative ones were the sharpener. When you write for a while you're gonna have to sharpen the pencil). Also when I play videogames with a friend, and I ask if he could do something and he asks me why, I ask him ""Why what?"" And have no idea what he's talking about. Then he has to explain what I asked him to do, and I have to try and figure out why I wanted him to do that. When playing any videogame, I don't really like it, but it makes it easier not to think about my life and how I shouldn't be so sad, because I have an above average good life.

I also get overwhelmed by the smallest things. Like if I need more of a resource (in a game), my mind just ""shorts"" as I cannot think about anything for a solid minute or two, until it ""reset"" itself. Anything somone says to me during that time will be answered with something, that may or may not make any sense, but I have no idea of what I'm saying and that I said it. This happens pretty much all the time, I think, atleast way too often."
3221,Life is not for me.,"I'm 18, I have depression, ADD, anxiety, and insomnia.

I'm a high school dropout. I am afraid of getting any sort of job. I cannot sleep normally. My anxiety keeps me on high alert during the day, and I'm then up at night, which fuels the insomnia. ADD makes me feel as though I don't have control over myself.

My family is ignorant to mental illness, except for my sister. She's one of the reasons I'm still living. I lost my therapist and the effects of my medications wear off weeks after switching.

I have three true friends, my two dogs and a person. Video games are my only pass time. They make me feel like I can be happy within the grim world I fell in. My love for pursuing a career in music is slowly dissipating. The rain is the only thing that makes me feel alive.

The days are my nights, and nights are my days.

Everything is crumbling, either one by one, or all together."
3222,"so long, and thanks for all the fish.",
3223,Finally taking a step forward for myself.,"I’ve finally been able to take a step forward for myself. I recently went through a horrible breakup, we were together for 4 years. I thought it was a forever thing and it sent my world crashing down. 

I struggle with opening up because it was never something I did growing up. I’ve finally found something that helps me. Music has given me that outlet. The negativity trapped in my heart and soul can be released with this outlet while I teach myself self love and care. It’s imperative to let out those feelings and thoughts, however irrational they may be. 

Sometimes what you feel and think deceives you but the damage it does is true. It festers and develops into something much worse. Depression, anxiety, PTSD and suicidal thoughts are something I struggle with daily and have been for a while, but I’ll fight them til the end. If there’s one thing I can do with my music it’s to let you know you’re not alone in your struggle. Always remember you possess all the power in your life to change and manipulate your situation for the better. 

One thing I try to do with my music is to put all the nasty invasive thoughts we all deal with out in the open. Fuck feeling hopeless. Fuck internalizing. Fuck feeling like you have to hide what you’re feeling to be normal for everybody else. We are who we are, and we shouldn’t have to hide that. I’m not sure if posting links to something like this is allowed, if it’s not I’ll remove it. Just a heads up for anyone that may listen. The lyrics are gritty and honest. No filter and that may be a trigger for some so please listen with caution. Love you guys. This sub has done a lot for me and I appreciate all of you.


[DAMASCENE](https://soundcloud.com/ofdamascus/a-lovely-suicide-feat-atama-prod-eem-triplin)"
3224,Need help,"In my head I constantly remind myself I’m not good enough, I constantly remind myself that I’m embarrassed of myself, I think about every stupid embarrassing thing I’ve done and I harp on it. I’ve been like this for the past two years, I constantly think about killing myself and how I would be better of. I just feel like a scumbag. I don’t know I honestly don’t know. The only time I’m social and up beat is when I drink but almost every embarrassing thing has happened when I have drank. So I’m done with it but everything I’ve done nags me, the shit I’ve said to people, the way I’ve acted and the way I perceive people look at me. I’ve always been super hard on myself, but it’s almost now nothing’s good enough. I don’t know how to forgot or get over stupid shit I’ve done. I hate myself and feel like the biggest scumbag on the planet, I don’t even talk to my parents anymore, I come home and just try to sleep. I’m young, I work hard, and I try to help people every chance I get. I try to be a good person and sometimes I think I am but that voice in my head reminds everytime of everything wrong thing I’ve done. It’s hemmed me up so many times, it’s hard for me to form relationships and keep relationships going. I know this isn’t right but I just feel like a pussy whenever I talk about it either. I’m my own worst enemy and I hate myself. I’m always anxious, depressed and I don’t know what to do."
3225,Has anyone experienced this?,"Lately I feel either nothing, forced happiness or enormous sadness. The things that used to bring me joy do not anymore and it feels like nothing matters.

I've lost the ability to be empathic and became a self-centered prick. I have more true friends but I feel lonlier than before. I'm more confident but more insecure. I'm happy, and yet, deep down, depressed. I like it when people care about me, but feel like a burden and have urges to distance myself from them. I care too much or not at all. 

Also for some reason I really do not like compliments? I don't know how to react to them and since I draw a lot I often get compliments about my art and honestly I'd rather get criticized than complimented. Sometimes I don't respond to them because of my awkwardness and afterwards I realize I come off as a dick.

This behaviour has kinda ruined my friendship with someone I deeply care about and I really need advice.

Has anyone felt this way?
If so, do you know If this state of mind goes away? How long does it last? Do I need to seek a psychologist?"
3226,I miss being able to enjoy life :(,"I miss having no worries in life

I miss being able to get excited over little things

I miss spending time with my friends

I miss being able to look at life in a positive way

I miss being able to have hopes and dreams

I miss having hobbies and interests 

I miss being able to cry

I miss being able to believe that people love and care for each other

I miss not having to put on a fake smile to trick others into thinking I am okay

I miss being able to feel emotions

I miss being able to laugh and make others laugh

I miss being kind and caring

I miss being a good person

I miss being able to like myself

I miss me

I miss being able to enjoy life

Will I ever get to experience these things again? Or are they gone forever?"
3227,Someone to talk to.,I’m a high school student from Massachusetts looking for someone to talk to. I’m depressed. Just really need someone to talk to. I’m a male 17 years old. I take dual enrollment psychology. Somewhat helps me. Just want a friend pm me.
3228,Is this the end for me? Not suicidal ok just read,"Depression cycles it never seems to end so what this post I have accepted let this play be my end now don't get me wrong I don't want this to be the end

I don't have a say it because to play the game, you realize how much of a game life becomes. Life to me now is inadequate don't have no I have no friends this one chick thinks I was harassing her that's how I come off to people as the crazy one or the stalker or the bad guy but in reality I was just misunderstood and sadly not good enough to others
Others are fools, just a bunch of f****** haters that judge someone for having different thinking if they don't understand it it's bad. I hope sooner rather later people stop being this way. Trust me I have a lot to work on I'm just not pointing out anybodys elses flaws, but you know what my flaws I can grow on
Our people can't grow on these flaws they have cuz they believe they are but reality nobody is we're just living day by day.
I miss dopamine normal brain sucks but you did it to yourself
Still a bullet wound people thanks for caring

3229,The holiday depression is coming,"I LOVE Christmas, or I used to.  I don't know if I still do or not.  I have the memories from when I was a child of being at my grandparents on Christmas Eve, looking out the window of my grandpa's bedroom towards my house with my cousins, watching to see if Santa and his reindeer came.  It's so funny remembering that we were all so gullible as my dad and uncle left to check on something, but in reality they were putting presents under the tree.  When we'd get home we were so excited to see the presents that santa dropped off that we BEGGED to open them not caring that Christmas was a sleep away.  Then going to church the next morning and whispering to our cousins during prayer to find out what they got for Christmas.  It filled me up with so much warmth, I loved getting together with my family and enjoying the company they'd bring... I'd love hearing the stories I've heard so many times before because my uncle's don't remember that they told the story before.  I don't know what happened, maybe I grew out of it... Maybe I got too cynical.  One year I was loving Christmas and the next year it was just another day.  It happened long before I moved out of my childhood home, long before I lost my mom.  Christmas stopped having the magic for me.  I'm sad that I don't feel the same way, I want to be filled with the joy I had when I was a kid.  I try to have the holiday cheer that I used to, but in reality I don't feel anything.  The day will pass and everything will move on to the next big thing.  I think maybe this is growing up, I really want to know how that happened so fast."
3231,"I can't fight this empty feeling anymore, man",I just want to mean something to someone for once...
3232,F(18) in college and suicidal thoughts won’t go away,"My mind keeps telling me it would be best to just kill myself. That no one would miss me. I’m failing at college. Failing my parents, failing myself. I have no friends. I’m about to be put on academic suspension even though I’ve done everything I can this semester. I can’t stop thinking that if I fail out of college I’ll kill myself. I can’t face myself or my family if that happens. I don’t know if I can do this alone anymore."
3233,A Rant,"My depression is at its all time worse. I’m constantly worried and crying. My stomach and head hurt all the time. Things in my life keep going wrong no matter how hard I try to stay positive. I really don’t have any friends that I can really talk to. I’ve been single my whole life and I’m starting to get wore out from being so lonely. I keep getting job rejection after job rejection. A year ago to almost the exact date, something very traumatic happened to me that I’m still trying to get over. The last 4 years have been awful and I want more than anything to have a hopeful/ great start to the new decade. Anyone else who feels the same way, you’re in my mind and prayers"
3234,Parties with depression,"I'm at a party right now and I'm on this sub instead of socializing alone. I just cant deal with it. Everyone is getting married, having a good time, talking about getting girls etc. Last party everyone noticed this and I got frequent check ins and ghosted by someone who I thought was cool.

This has been my first ever year going to parties and I'm in my late 20's. I used to Dream of these things as people like me never get invited or shunned from them. But now I'm here what's the point. I keep on thinking of not being on earth instead of drinking or what ever they doing. Hopefully something changes but otherwise fml as usual. Idk how I'm going to recover from this disappointment."
3235,My friend doesn’t believe me,"Today my friend straight up told me I look dead and went on to ask me if i was doing drugs. I told him that I wasn’t, he said he didn’t believe me. It frustrated me because he knows me very well, instead they he told me to get my act together. I’ve never done drugs, my mental health has just taken a toll on my physical health and he doesn’t get it. I can’t believe this is happening."
3236,Easily the worst part of my life.,"Does anyone else not have anyone in their lives? I'm talking about no friends, no significant other, no close family members, nobody. That's the situation I am in right now. The isolation and loneliness kills me. I don't know how much longer I can sustain this. My mental health just keeps on getting worse and worse."
3237,So ashamed to be depressed and talk about it,"Everyone here, and I mean literally everyone who shares the reasons why they are depressed have pretty darn solid reasons. Like, it's legit kind of reasons of why they are depressed.

But not me. Sadly, my reason to be depressed is so insignificant that nobody would take it seriously, and rather think that I'm trolling or joking. And I know that. I have to right to ask others for helping, since my reason is so miniscure.

Depression, unfortunately, doesn't have that courtesy. It simply exists and simply strangles me."
3238,How do you motivate yourself going to school/work?,"11th grade. I want to finish 12, but I really can't see myself doing it. Missed 3x this week. Also can't focus on fixing my grades."
3239,its the small things,"It seems that everyday somewhere I see a meme about depression. People laughing on the outside to make themselves feel better on the inside. I know that I'm the type to share memes about being depressed that are humorous but deep down on the inside I feel like I'm lifeless. Deep down on the inside I feel nothing everyday. A little background about my self, I'm a dad of 2 girls soon to be 2 girls and 1 boy, I'm in the military, and I struggle everyday with depression without anyone in the world noticing. 

Everyday is a great day on the outside. you can ask my friends and family. I'm the most outgoing person who is always there when you need me to be. I have a ton of friends and a family yet everyday I'm alone. 

Its the small things in this world that add up to where I am today I guess. small things like when my wife told me that I ruined her happiness. when she told me that as soon as I enlisted her life ended. its the small things like everyday when I build her up to make her feel confident, sexy, smart because I know she struggles with anxiety and poor self image, she shrugs it off as if my words don't mean anything to her. its the small things like when I feel trapped in a job I hate surrounded by leadership that consistently fails me, leadership that only cares about there own career progression and how they look rather than the needs of there soldiers. its the small things like when I reach out to close friends and they don't care enough to hold a conversation with me. its the small things like when I go home every year on leave and no one wants to take the time out of there day to come see me even though I just drove 12 hours home to see them. Theres a darkness deep inside of me that I can feel everyday. I feel at time that my head is under a pillow and I'm gasping for air. I'm kicking and screaming on the inside to be noticed so someone can help me. 

I was never the popular kid growing up. I always struggled to fit in which meant me acting like someone I wasn't to feel that way. I'm an attractive guy. I'm loving I'm caring and I try my hardest to please everyone. so why cant I be happy? when is it my turn? is it even worth it to continue being the human I am? I've thought about killing my self in the past but I would never do it. I couldn't do it even if I tried. I love my family too much to do that to them. I guess ill just live the rest of my life in the shell of a man who once was."
3241,When your friends' advice doesn't fit your situation and your support system feels non existent,I don't know where to turn for support right now. My heart is heavy and I'm having trouble finding someone to hear me. I'm challenging myself to be strong and put one foot in front of the other even if I don't know why I'm doing it. It's a sort of blind faith in myself. I'm feeling unsettled when my thoughts start to drift to comparisons of others' struggles compare to my own. Seeing others suffer through emotional strain and uncertainty while receiving deep and meaningful support from friends and family challenges my ability to believe that I could survive and overcome my own challenges without such a support system. I'm not sure where to go from here but life only seems to let you go forward so I guess that's the direction I'm going.
3242,I feel so alone,"I'm a grown ass man but my life feels so fucked.

Today I went from everything is fine to alone and depressed, I don't know what caused it. I want to tell my friend about it, but I know she can't do anything to fix it, and she has her own problem and I don't want to bring her down. 

I really wish someone would just hug me and talk to me about everything and nothing so I wouldn't be alone with my own head. 

I keep checking Facebook, tinder, snapchat in some kind of desperate hope that someone is gonna magically save me, but no, no one is gonna do that because they fucking can't, I don't even know what I expect. 

I just want to disappear right now, either by vanishing into thin air or by blowing my fucking head of, I don't care, I just don't want to feel like this."
3244,How hard is it to ask???,"My family was doing the annual cookie frosting and my grandpa, again, just randomly pointed his camera in my face and snapped a picture without asking. Of course, I got a bit mad. My whole family knows that I'm insecure about pictures, so I prefer to be at least asked or told so I don't end up with a picture that makes me feel even more insecure about my self image. And yet they still do this shit with shoving cameras in my face and snapping a picture without asking because ""well you say no to every picture so how else are we supposed to get one"". Because god forbid i dont feel pretty enough to have a picture taken of me one day and say no. Nope. Theyre fucking entitled to pictures. And when I tell them its a self image thing its ""well then fix your self image"". Why can't they just fucking respect that I don't want pictures taken of me sometimes. 

Thing is I might have said yes to that picture if he had just asked. I was feeling cute today. And that just ruined my mood because the whole family just gave me the ""get over it because we're taking and posting pictures anyways"" spiel."
3245,My brother hates how selfish I am and wishes to not speak anymore. I don’t realize when my behavior is selfish.,The guilt and shame is agonizing.
3246,"I will pay whoever will kill me $10,000 to do it.","I've been in so much pain for the last 3 months and it isn't going to get better. Dont try to talk me out of it, you will only upset me more."
3247,Shutting down,"Writing this while crying on my bedroom floor in the dark, after hearing my step dad threatening to snap my neck for the 3rd time in the past year just for skipping dinner. Why did I skip? Because of him. Apparently when my parents give me birthday gifts they're entitled to have me spend it on them. I got a gift card from them. One of my only birthday gifts. I spent it on a new game controller since mine's been broken. Everytime I get something they feel entitled to it and treat me like scum when I use it on myself
Then when I get upset and cry they call it all a joke, and announce to the house that I can't take a joke. Totally joking. Constantly treating me like scum and threatening to kill me is totally a joke. At this point I just hope a bus comes and hits me or something. I'd rather be in prison than live with these people any longer"
3248,I wish people forgot I ever existed,I just want to disappear. The only reason why I haven’t given up is because there are still people in my life that want me to keep going. If they forgot about me I could finally give up.
3249,Depression tells me no one cares and Anxitey says everyone is watching me. Mental Hell,
3250,I want my mom back,"I'm laying here in bed crying after I fell outside in the snow and hurt myself, and I just want my mom. 

I want her to be better. I miss who she use to be before everything happened, and she tried to kill herself. I just want my mom to be a mom again."
3251,"about a month and a half ago, i nearly died. substance abuse nearly killed me.","im 18. ive been clinically depressed for years. 

november somethingth, a month or so ago. typing this out is making me shake. i want to cry and puke. 

i took the entire bottle of my prescribed klonopin, a benzo that slows down the central nervous system. i dont even know how much i took

and then drank 2-3 mini bottles of liquor

and then went out, hooking up with a guy from grindr. someone i had never met, i dont even remember what he looked like. 

drank some more, a lot more, and then curled up in bed with him.

and blacked the hell out. i remember nothing past that point. nothing at all, until i woke up.

i genuinely could hardly walk the next morning. i vaguely remember crawling out of bed and dragging myself along the floor, trying to get my shoes on and get out of the house without alerting his family who didnt know i was there. i got outside and called my dad who picked me up

i still could barely walk. partially because of the pain in my ass, mostly because my body didnt know how to. i felt so, so weak, both mentally and physically. 

mixing benzos and alcohol in large quantities can kill you. i very much could have died, but... i didnt. 

i doubt anyone will read this, im mostly just writing this out so i can try and process it myself. ive been suppressing it for the past month."
3252,So I've hit rock bottom again,"Awhile ago I was at rock bottom. Attempting suicide by overdose. Not caring for my own safety etc.

It picked up.

Now I'm back. Few days ago I sat in a bath. Extension lead plugged into a wall and a toaster with it. You can gather the rest. On a daily basis I think of a new way I can kill myself and it seems to get closer every time.
There is physically nothing I can do"
3253,someone please help,i started cutting like a month ago and tonight i’ve realized i made a huge mistake. i’m looking down at my leg right now and it’s torn to shreds. please i don’t want to live like this does anyone have a way i can stop.
3254,I feel like a loser who won't succeed in life. (20F),"This is throw away if that's okay. I don't have any friends or close family to talk to about this so here I am. Anyway, I had an argument with my sister and she started calling me a loser because I don't have a job yet, how I sit at home, look at my tablet all day and that even my niece who's 3 years younger than me has a job. And I how depend on my dad and her for everything.
 
I kept telling her I wasn't a loser but everything she said is what I feel about myself already. It just stings more when someone else notices and points it out. 

She is right. I don't know how to get the city by public transportation like most people. I haven't filled out any application yet because I'm waiting on my dad to get his car fixed instead of just taking the bus or train. 

My dad said he'd pay for community college but I don't feel motivated or smart enough for that, So I'm going into the workforce instead of wasting his money.

I feel like a failure and a burden to everyone right now. I don't like relying on everyone like this. It's coming to a point where video games distract me from my this anymore. I just want it to stop."
3255,How to help?,"I am hoping to get some advice on how to help my boyfriend. He's currently struggling with is depression, I am as well, but not nearly as bad. He refuses to get any help, and therefore I don't know how to help him. He pushes me away and only talks to me every 3 days or so. I feel like I'm the only one trying and I'm so tired. Any advice would be great, thank you."
3256,Feeling gross all the time,"Does anyone here feel gross in their own skin? I'm tired of it. I feel gross since I was little. It's a feeling of disgust that never leaves.

I'm ashamed of myself. I'm ashamed of what I was. That stupid little ignorant kid, with ugly hair and ugly face. That's me... I still feel like that.

I hate my skin. It's so gross. I hate to touch my skin. It's so hard to take a bath! Gross! I hate this body! I hate myself! I hate this! Everything I touch will become dirty. Everything is gross because of me. I feel disgusting. I'm disgusting!

I'm trash! I want to die. My body feels so dirty all the time... I feel awful...

I can't take this anymore! I hate myself so much!! I need to cut it!!"
3257,Fuck you I'm drunk,"Fuck you, that's all going through my head, gucl you, fuck everyone who's just me, ducl you, I want to die I want to destroy, I want to break, I want to kill, I want 5o be noric3s beyond the probl3ms I cause, fuck you let me die, let me kill myself, let me destroy myself? I just want to hold you, fuck you, I'm a selfish, drunk, pothead loser fuck me, fuck me I'm a piece of garbage, I'm garbage, selfish garbage, fuck me I'm worthless fuck me I'm garbage fuck it"
3258,How to not be depressed on Christmas?,"I'll try to make this as short as I can. My life is pretty horrific. I know I need to try to get out of my situation in general but I'm wondering how I can not feel such crippling depression, especially on Christmas? 

I have no family. I was very close with my father who passed away suddenly just a few years ago. My mother was always a narcissist since I was a little girl, constantly cheating on my dad even though he took care of her and treated her well. She was never emotionally available for me, always very self absorbed, etc. Right after my dad passed away, she moved across the country to be with a wealthy man who could be her father and pretty much left me to rot. I've gone no contact with her, along with my sister who is the splitting image of my mother. As lonely as it is, it hurts more having them in the picture. So, being with family is out of the question. 

It gets worse! I moved in with my abusive boyfriend after my mom sold the house right after my father died. It was so sudden, I didn't even have time to save for a place of my own. When I say my boyfriend is abusive, I mean both physically and mentally. I'm trying to get a job but my license expired and he dictates me to the extreme, so I've been pretty secluded from the world and have no money of my own. Or friends. 

I'll be honest, I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and fight to keep my head above water every day. I know it sounds pretty hopeless, but does anyone have any advice? I feel lonely every day, but since my father died, I really dread Christmas and sitting alone with nobody but my own bleak thoughts."
3260,Feeling extremely depressed. The worst I've felt in all of 2019. Not in any danger but feeling extremely bad. What can I do to feel better?, I don't have any reason to be depressed. Been extremely unproductive  over the past 5 months. I'm currently withdrawing from caffeine and   Ritalin which is prescribed. Recently rejected by a girl I've been close  to for years.  I'm not interested in seeing a doctor. I'm not  interested in talking to anybody. I've already done 150 push-ups and I  plan on going for a 4 mile run soon. I know I will feel better in a few  weeks. I just want to feel a bit better in the short term.
3261,When it happens to someone else,"When somebody else says he/she has depression or have committed suicide people start to feel bad and empathetic. They say they would have helped if they knew and so on, yet here I am...depressed and miserable. Most people ignore me and a few pick on me. This had been going for years... Honestly, people’s hypocrisy kills me more than my unstable emotional state."
3262,I feel like a fucking retard and I overthink too much. Almost everything I do is wrong. Why does God hate me?,
3263,do not wait for you happiness find it,"This my first time posting on this subreddit, i need somewhere to vent, so my freshmen year of highschool i met this girl and was instantly attracted she was the first girl i ever worked up the courage to talk to eventually after months of talking i told her i liked her but she did not feel the same, she told me maybe one day she would and thats when i shouldve stopped talking with her, the same month i got rejected my grandmother passed away and the last time i saw her i didnt choose to spend time with her these events put me into a deep depression for 2 years and during these 2 years i kept letting this girl get my hopes up and let me down over and over again she would lead me on at one point she told me she liked me, i eventually found out that she was sucking other dudes dicks and that she had feelings for my best friend and it was at that moment i realized i deserved better i eventually stopped talking to her and battled through depression for another year and here i am with low self esteem no confidence but i am working towards becoming a better me. if there is any lesson to learn from this is do not put anyone elses happiness above yours"
3264,I think I have depression?,"I feel depressed? I think.

I feel so lost in life sometimes and feel sad. I don’t know how to combat these feelings, I just feel like I have no idea how to feel fulfilled or happy in life. Can I get some advice?"
3265,Life isnt fair,"I was going to be a chemical engineer, first year was easy and i was just beginning my second year without a care in the world. I always have to write i have autism so people understand me. But then i found someone via a girl friend and she was fuckable so i thought i want this girl to be mine and was immediately thinking of fcking her. But her parents were very critical, they were churchgoërs and apparently the girl has had bad boyfriends in the past. They didnt believe me even when my fb said ‘TU eindhoven’ as education that i was actually doing chemical engineering. They insisted i wasn’t to be trusted and eventually introduced her to a friend of her brother, some random mechanic.. so i became agitated bc this was already like cheating although they didnt ‘want me to know’ it yet... why can’t these girls be dating high educated engineers? Why does some random mechanic have to pop up and this girl forced by her parents to date a simple person. Life really sucks with autism, people misunderstand you and judge you for a way worse person than you are. Now im no-one and every word you say will make me try to kill myself. If a political person or anyone is going to say something that destroys my future im killing myself. I was going to be an engineer with a beautiful gf, but people really hate autists"
3266,"made a decision, I'm done","I REALLY have a lot of nice things I want to leave with someone.   Nice expensive jewelry,  unworn stuff with price tags,  etc.   Where to donate?   I will not be deterred.   I am ready to do this,   and trust me -- I am someone who has been struggling FAR TOO LONG (over thirty five years at least)  so it's the right decision for me.   Love and best wishes to all."
3267,"How do you manage depression, work, parenthood, life all at the same time?","I’m really struggling. Depression makes all the normal day to day stuff feel near impossible most days. How does a depressed person manage to get up in the mornings and head to work? Or get up and have to immediately tend to their son/daughter while they barely have the energy to tend for themselves? To an average Joe it’s not that complicated. To a depressed individual it’s like fighting an uphill battle day in and day out. Some days it’s hard enough just to put words together. 

I’ve been a stay at home mom most of the year. I got used to being home a lot with my son. When I found out I got the job I applied for, I was originally looking forward to it and the new schedule/routine. I thought it would help me feel better to have something to do, for me. Currently, I’m already dreading the next day of work. If anything, since I started work my depression has worsened. My confidence has dropped too. I’m more exhausted than I’ve been in years. I feel disheveled and not put together. I just feel like I’m really having to push myself extra, extra hard to even want to get up in the mornings. I thought a job would help me feel like I have a purpose/ something to make me WANT to wake up in the morning for, but nope. If anything, it’s made all my thoughts and feelings that much worse. 

On top of all that, I come home afterwards and have to immediately take care of my 4 year old son. It’s just all so much more than I have the energy for. I despise feeling like I’m on someone else’s leash or have people depending on me when I feel so weak and not dependable inside. 

Depression makes literally everything feel like projects/chores/headaches I don’t ever want to complete."
3268,i feel like i'm in my life's epilogue,"I'm still pretty young but i already feel like my life is ending. No friends, next to no family, barely anyone knows i exist and i don't even know what to do with myself most of the time. I think about dying basically every single day at this point, but i don't tell anybody because i don't want to be hospitalized against my will, that already happened once and i don't want it to happen again. I've been trying to get help from professionals but everyone i've had ends up being horrible, one therapist even got mad at me and started shaking me violently for not cooperating, which fucked me up pretty badly too. I don't really trust therapists anymore thanks to that. Idk why i'm writing any of this, i guess i'm just rambling because nobody wants to listen to me. I just feel like ending my life constantly. I don't wanna sound like i'm an 11 year old emo boy but i genuinely feel like nobody understands me. Anyway that's enough for now, i just wanted to get this off my chest before i go to sleep."
3269,Well,So I failed my genetics class again. Things like this make me so depressed even more than what I am. Idk if any of you feel like you just can’t do anything right. It’s always a mess. You always mess up. And nothing is ever good enough. And that’s how I feel right now. Maybe it’s me. Maybe I’m not good enough to excel like others do.
3270,What strategies do you have to get yourself up and functioning?,"I'm out of ideas right now, any tricks or tips that can help you start moving into a good head space?"
3271,I don't want to be lonely anymore,I'm tired of being lonely can anyone chat? 😭
3272,Happy but sad,"So,i’ve finally moved on from my ex and now i got into a good relationship with a person who treats me right and cares about me,but yet i can’t be happy and show constant mood swings bc i just feel like im gonna lose it all,I can’t go on like this I wish i was just gone.."
3273,Anyone bored?,"Of things that they enjoy doing? For me it’s gaming, it’s a nice distraction but it’s not as fun as I was expecting. Join a couple sessions get a few kills, I think it’s bcuz the repetitiveness is getting to me. I have lost quite a lot of interest in SP games and ‘am starting to do the same with MP stuff."
3274,Long term depression,"Hey people of Reddit. I need a bit of help or advice. I've struggled with depression most my life. It really started with a near death experience when I was 12. I came out from behind the school bus and got clipped by a car doing doing about 120kph and came to understand the meaning of life and death. If I was half a second faster coming out from behind that bus I was dead or half a second slower it would have missed me altogether.
That happened two weeks into secondary school, after that I began to question everything; life, death, religion, family, friends, everything. Not long after that began the five continuous years of verbal bullying witch I just accepted thinking that I deserved it. And during this time my teeth began to chip away which just added to my self confidence being destroyed.
After leaving school I entered into a routine of working 10 to 12 hours in a shitty hotel coming ng home getting really stoned playing games for a few hours and going to bed thinking about suicide. This went on few about 6 or 7 years.
The last year or 2 has been better as I have a new job and can see a future for myself and no longer think about suicide but I still think about death regularly. I need help getting out of this hole and to start working towards my goals. Any advice or help would be much appreciated. Thanks."
3275,Tired of feeling fine one day then feeling like shit the next day,Yesterday I actually felt like I was a normal sane human being. Today I feel like I am losing my sanity. I am exhausted.
3276,I enjoy Depression,"Ever since ive gotten depressed in 6th grade, and once ive gotten out of it, it happened that I really liked being depressed and not because I was edgy and thought it was cool, I genuily liked feeling suicidal, it makes me a different person, it makes me enjoy other things than if I were to be happy, it makes me think differently. And yea years later I had multiple depression periods, different depression factors, some were from stress,some from hopelessness, others were from boredom, life being meaningless....  And honestly it may be my maturity but I havent felt stress in so long, I cant remember it anymore, nothing gets me stressed anymore, meybe because I developed some kind of long term depression of not giving a shit about anything... If I had a choice between choosing happyness or depression I would go for depression. These days I dont get depressed at all, when i feel depression I get happy, the only way I get depressed is from doing absolutely nothing, boredom basically. If I were to lock myself in a bathroom for 2weeks with obvs a giant supply of food and just sitting not doing a thing, then I would definetly get depressed, its one hell of a boring torture tho. 

Anyway my question is, is there a term for people who enjoy feeling depressed? And is there a way that would get me depressed without torturing myself with boredom, just like anti depression pills, but reversed?"
3277,Is it bad to not want to feel good?,"Ive been through a lot the past few years and 2019 was the year of death apparently. Lost my uncle and my godmothers brother recently and my manager just told me in other words im a liability cause i sprained my ankle at work, and ive been overwhelmed with the usual judgment, under the breath talks, and loud frequencies. Like Should I really try to feel good... like i dont know anymore..."
3278,Tired of feeling fine one day then feeling like shit the next,Yesterday I actually felt like I was a normal sane human being. Today I feel like I am losing my sanity. I am exhausted.
3279,"I am more functional! (But i think i am near a breaking point, so bittersweet i guess)","I don't miss school because i feel like i 'physically' can't get out of bed anymore, i am doing homework and studying (probably because of adhd meds). I seem more happy more socially active?

 But jesus fucking christ; absolutely nothing has changed.  I feel like shit inside: the same thoughts, feelings, i can't seem to stop overthinking and being  overwhelmed by everything. 
I really don't know for how much longer i can keep this charade  going. It's exhausting and piece by piece i an falling apart."
3280,"I don't know where I'm going with my life, and I seriously need help or advice. Please.","This is going to be lengthy. It will probably be boring. It will probably be hard to understand. But I will try my absolute hardest to explain what's been going on.

Here in the last month or so, things have no gone well. My parents basically have split and will divorce soon. I'm nearly 19 years old and have no idea what to do with my life. I'm unemployed, living with my mother and 3 other siblings. I'm having serious health problems going on. None of us have really have an income right now, we're piss poor broke, and we have no insurance. 

Let me explain how this happened.


For the last year, there's been alot of serious relationship issues between my parents. They basically have fought none stop since I was around 2, and they've split once, but managed to work it out until now. It got to the point to where they didn't even acknowledge eachother, and anything said resulted in a fight. My mother got tired of everything, and within a few weeks she began packing things around the house and basically told me I had a choice. And I mean a life decision choice. I could either stay with my father, or I could go with her and my 3 siblings to where we used to live. Knowing that she couldn't support everyone, let alone pay rent, I went with her. I still don't know if this was a mistake. 

We moved from Kentucky back to Florida, meaning we are over 800 miles away from my father. I was expecting a change in pace moving back here (we lived here before) but in all honesty nothing has worked out. We've lived here for about 4 weeks now, and despite being separated and soon to be divorced, my parents still fight over the phone. My dad wants to talk to the younger kids, but they just can't work their shit out. They then left it up to ME to hold the family together and make sure that everyone talks to him, but I just couldn't deal with that. Things still haven't worked out between them, but after me explaining that I do not want to be apart of that, my mother reluctantly took back the responsibility.

I have a job interview soon, but I am completely broke. My mother is as well, and makes about $100 a week from doing eBay stuff, and that's simply not enough. I've agreed to help pay up to $400 in rent (basically water, electric, and wifi bills added up) and help out with groceries on occasion. But for the moment, that's not possible.

We have no insurance either, and I suffer from horrible asthma and horrible eczema. I desperately need my inhaler and ointment, but simply cannot pay. I was able to spend the last of my money on one inhaler and a small tube of ointment, and both are about to run out. 

Our house is constantly a mess because nobody wants to clean it up. And I won't lie, I don't either. It's the same shit each day. Messy ass house, and once it gets cleaned it's dirty again right after.

All 3 of my siblings are just unbearable to be living with. I'm the only guy in this house, and it's me being surrounded by my mother and 2 asshole sisters. My brother is just 2, so I can't really consider him anything. I'm 18, the oldest sister is 15, youngest is 11. The 15 year old gets better treatment than I do. I don't know why, she's an absolute shithead and I guess it's because she's adjusted to this situation better than me.

I don't have a driver's licence yet. So I can't really go out when I like, not that I could anyway. I'm expected to babysit on a daily basis since I don't have a job yet. It's been the same cycle for almost 4 weeks. 

I don't have many friends here. Most of the ones I had have moved on, and the few that are still with me are living their lives and have their own shit going on. So even if I wanted to go out, I have nobody to hang with. Being stuck in this house almost every.single.day is absolutely unbearable.

I won't lie, I haven't been myself for a good two weeks. I've been wondering to myself if it was worth it to come down here. Should I have stayed up there with my father? Should I have just gone my own route? I don't know. I'm an adult now and I don't know how to handle this. It's really getting to me. I tell my mother this, and she goes on to tell me how easy I have it, and how I'm not neglected. Which I understand. I do have a roof over my head and food to eat. But home doesn't even feel like home anymore. I don't want to be here, but I have to be here. I don't really do anything now but just lay in bed. Even when I'm not tired, I'm still tired. I've been like this for a few days. My mom's now threating to kick me out if I don't become productive. I just don't know what to do anymore.

It's not easy being dragged down by the weight of the stone. I'm starting to wonder if it's just me or if it's everyone else. Am I just ungrateful? Am I entitled? Do I have it easy? Am I the one who's to blame? I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't even know. I really don't. I feel so drained...I just don't know what to do with myself.

I've heard that guys aren't supposed to cry. But I won't lie. I've cried alot. I've cried so much. I don't even feel like a man let alone myself. I would see a doctor or a therapist or some shit...but I have no money not insurance right now. I'm not trying to help myself. I have no motivation. I'm trying to see the bright side but it's just not there. 

I'm sorry if this has been too long and vague. This is just what's been happening. I don't know what to do anymore. I know there's people who have it way worse. I just feel really sad and uninspired to do anything. I really don't know anymore. I really would appreciate it if anyone leaves any form of advice. I would be very grateful. I'm sorry for taking your time...but I still thank you in return."
3281,Life is nothing but a burden: change my mind,"I've realized that the thing that takes up all my time is avoiding disappointment, of course it still happens fairly often. I think it can be explained kind of like this: someone goes to work every day to attain money to avoid starvation. If you're dead you don't have to worry about avoiding starvation. But people say, wait a minute then you lose all the good thinks too. Well yes, but what if the good things in your life are so insignificant that they are negligence compared to the bad. For me missing out on the few good things is more than worth it to get rid of the bad. 

I really wish I was dead."
3282,"This is it, this is it until I die","I have a reasonably comfy but low paid job and no particular ambition.

Living in a shared house and putting up with other peoples shit.

Can't afford a place of my own. Can't ever imagine having a place of my own.

My pension will be shit as I started saving far too late so wont be able to afford to retire.

So I'll be stuck renting shared accomodation until I die. Nowhere I can call home as I'll always be at the whim and mercy of landlords (had to move twice in the last two years due to them wanting to sell).

This prospect is so bleak it makes suicide seem almost inevitable. Maybe not yet, but for the last few years I've had something of a mantra, a recurring thought, ""I'll kill myself at 40"". I'm 37 next month. Who knows if I'll go through with it at 40, but right now that idea is more appealing than *this* until I'm 65, 70, 80.

""who knows what will happen?"" some might ask, but in all honesty given that the last decade has been in much the same vein I can't see much changing at all. It's not in my nature to force change unless I have to. A character flaw for sure, and one of the many things I dislike about myself."
3283,I was humiliated again and for the last time. Going to hang myself. 20/M.,"I'm 20. 6'4"" height, far below average looks.

However, the worst thing is probably penis size. I'm below 3 inches.

Everyday I hear comments about small dicks. Bet he has a small dick, ""small dick energy memes"", big dick is better, simple fact, like a strong jawline is better, just simple facts.

I got humiliated, completely crushed me. Noone is ever seeing it again. How would I even approach sex? ""oh by the way, I have a small dick"" who does that? it would be even more embarrasing in a relationship for the girl, she would know that I have a small dick, would lie to friends, and eventually cheat.


I've always had looks of digust my whole life. Been bullied all my life and completely ignored. I have no talent, ugly, stupid and poor.

How did these genetics survive this long? surely the bad shit would've died out during the thousands of years?

This is the straw that broke the camels back. I hope that everyone else struggling with this or something similar can find comfort and peace with themselves.

I'm off to hang myself at my favourite spot."
3284,I'm worried for my mom,"Some background to this:

My youngest brother has Aspergers, let's call him Bob. And call my other brother Arthur.  
My mother has always been kind and sweet to me and my brothers. But she's always been kind of manipulative and controlling. As well as she got very mad once she got mad. This has made it hard for me to live there, same with Bob. This year we've basically moved to my dad's place, he's nice and he isn't as bad to live with as my mother. But anyhow, Arthur has lived with my mother because he wanted to get away from me and Bob. I and Bob rarely visited my Mother because well I guess trauma from when I was living there has kept me away. Also because of the trauma and my mother's anger problem, I have now a very hard time saying no to my parents. My brain always tells me ""your dad/mom will get mad if you say no"" so I try to like not to answer and just sit there.

But today Arthur has moved to my dad's place because he was always fighting with my mother. I'm worried she'll hurt herself or, in worst cases, commit suicide. I don't want that to happen because I love her but I still don't want to spend time with her because of the childhood trauma. I'm 16 and I don't want to be controlled and yelled on for the tiniest thing. 

Can someone help me, please?"
3285,Im past the point of wanting someone to ask me how I am,"Its been a while since someone had asked me how I was doing, and even longer since I answered honestly. And Im sure it might be nice to hear but I have nothing to tell."
3287,I feel like I'm losing hope,"My country just elected a government that's going to sell away my health care and doesn't give two fucks about the pain I'm going through.

There's shortages for the medication I take and my bank account is being drained by the fact I have to pay for the medication.

The waiting list for getting it through the NHS never seems to move, seeming like it'll take until summer 2021 to be where I am now if I was to wait.

Most of my family are transphobic so I can't talk to them about how I'm feeling through all this.

My ""real friends"" blow me off anytime I ask to talk about things even though I'm there for them when they need to vent to me.

I'm doing a college course I hate and want to leave but I've already dedicated 4+ years to this path and I feel like I'm trapped in this career path.

A majority of my class are transphobic including those I have to do group work with.

I'm really trying to stay positive about things, but life just keeps making it harder and harder.

Sometimes I think about ending it all or just running away from everything and just going somewhere new where no-one knows me. Where I can be free to be open about myself without facing judgement by people who used to know the ""old"" me and only see that person instead of who I am now

I don't really know what this is, I just needed to vent

3288,Have depression gave you the sensibility to understand suffering in the world better?,"Due to having a lower capability to experience joy have you ever imagine a kind of society where being miserable or sad are less accessible states of being for the people? Have depression ever made you dream an utopia of any kind?. Have despair and emptiness made you an ""idealist""?"
3289,I'm new to this,"My boyfriend has a daughter and only see me maybe twice a month. He says he loves me and I feel none of it. Now when I wake up in the morning, the first thing I tell myself is ""don't cry, don't cry, not yet."" Then I put on my best fake smile and go to work. And I can usually make it to my car after work before the waterworks start. But if I am really good I can make it home and change first. Then when my eyes hurt too much, I try to eat something and tired myself out with Netflix and other things before I go to bed. Because if I am not dead tired, I tend to cry for a very long time before I fall asleep. And its repeat everyday unless I see him, then I keep the tears in check until he leaves.

It's so exhausting keeping myself in check all the time. I don't care about what I look like anymore, no effort for makeup. There is always a pit in my stomach and my throat is always burning even if there are no visible tears. I lost interest in most things that I used to like. I don't want to be sad and alone anymore but its everyday. I cant tell my bf because I end up suffering for it if I stress him out with how sad I am."
3290,Exercise just doesn’t seem to help,"Having a terrible funk right now, thought I’d strap on my VR headset and escape for a bit, played beat saber and a couple other games that are very sweat inducing. I just don’t feel better... I didn’t have a rush of endorphins nor did I really enjoy playing at all... this sucks."
3291,I’m scared of turning 21.,"My birthday is in 2 months and I’m really worried because I’ll be legally allowed to drink and I know what everyone will want to do. My family is going to want me to celebrate by having me drink alcohol and that scares me so bad. The reason why I’m scared is because of my mom. 

She died due to alcohol poisoning and cirrhosis of the liver. She was belligerent and terrifying and so angry when she got drunk. After my dad moved out because of her behavior, I stayed with her for a while and it was a living hell. I was scared to leave the house because she would yell at me if I stayed out 1 second longer than she permitted. She would start fights and tell me that my dad was a horrible person. She gaslighted me and made me feel like shit. Because she got so sick from the poisoning, I had to take care of her at times. 

At some points, I would even start screaming at her because she wouldn’t listen to me or I’d just get so frustrated and all my bottled up anger came out at her. I got so mad that I cried. I was so upset with myself for yelling at her that I wanted to kill myself because I felt like such a terrible son. 

I even started to self harm because of that living situation. I cut myself and punched myself in the face and would starve myself because I didn’t want to leave my room. I hated life and felt miserable. I almost tried committing suicide on two occasions because of everything, but I felt like I couldn’t leave her alone by herself. I was so conflicted over wanting to die and staying with my emotionally abusive mom. 

I don’t want to drink because I don’t want to get drunk and end up like her. I’m terrified of how I’d be if I started drinking. I don’t want to be like her. I don’t want to inflict that pain on anyone else. That scares me. I’m tearing up typing this. I don’t want to go back to that ever again. I don’t want to be her. I can’t be her. I’m scared..."
3292,I just need a hug,I just want to feel like someone actually cares for me
3293,I hate my life,I’m a 19 year old college student who still doesn’t know know what I want to do with my life. I live at home with my mom and brother and  I always feel resentment towards them mainly my mother because of how she’s treated me since I was a child. I can’t get financial aid cause my grades are shit so I had to ask my mom for help which ended in her blowing up at me. I’m constantly thinking about suicide I tried once in highschool by trying to overdose on pain pills but I didn’t take enough of them and whenever something goes bad I always think of trying to attempt it again but I know I’m too much of a bitch to try it again. I’ve recently started having panic attacks whenever I think about my future so I just cry while looking in the mirror and telling myself how much of a failure I am.  I’m always fantasizing about some random person breaking into my apartment and killing me or getting shot dead in the streets.
3294,"No friends, An Alcoholic father, A depressed mother, A gf who’s parents don’t accept me &amp; about to drop out of college","Just looking for a place to share my story &amp; find tips for dealing with loneliness, anxiety and depression. For those interested in the back story: 

My dad has been addicted to alcohol as long as I can remember. When he drank he would get aggressive. My mom, younger brother and me would flee out of the house and spend one or more nights in the car, I’ve spend nights in the street aswell. 

Just before I went to college my parents divorced. I hoped things would get better but they didn’t. My dad promised to sober up but his addiction got worse. My mom and brother don’t speak to him anymore, neither do my uncles and aunts. I’m the only one who still looks after him. After the divorce my mom got severly depressed and my younger brother dropped out of school and spends his nights outside the house doing god knows what. This means I’ve been doing most of the housekeeping like cooking and cleaning. Combining this with working parttime and going to college broke me. 

I’ve always been chased by anxiety, depression and lonliness but always managed to escape. This time those feelings won. I’ve stopped going to classes since october. Before I stopped I got an internship at a big company, everybody keeps telling me I should be so proud and happy but I just can’t. I’m supposed to start in february and I am serouisly considering to cancel it. I’ve always had good grades and really want to get my bachelors degree to make my parents proud and provide a happy moment for my family, but atm i just can’t.

I’ve always been the ‘funny guy’ in school. Eventhough i didn’t have any real friends, i was good at connecting to other people. I’m losing that know, i’ve noticed communicating with others is getting harder for me and I even started stuttering. 
At night I have feelings of anxiety. My dad moved out of the house 3,5 years ago. But with every sound I hear at night, I think it’s him who’s drunk. As a result I start breathing heavy or scream for help. 
During the day i go the work. It feels good, but when i’m not at work I get feelings of depression and loneliness. I feel like i’m losing myself and i don’t know what to do. 

At the moment, the only positive thing in my life is my gf. She’s the sweetest girl ever. Unfortunatly she was raised by very conservative and religious parents. Wich means she can’t have a boyfriend. So we keep our relationship a secret. We’ve been in a four year relationship, and the only way we ever could ‘freely’ be together is if I convert or she decides to leave her family for me. I know this is an unhealthy situation and it may be best for both of us to break up. It’s just that I really love her and she’s the only person who really gets me, since i don’t have any friends. 

And that brings me here. It’s saturday night, everyone is having fun with their friends. Meanwhile I’m here, sitting in a car at a empty parking lot just drowning in my thoughts. I feel like such a fuck up and wonder if i’m ever going to feel better again. I really don’t know what to do."
3295,Being alive is a scam,I get panic attacks over simple things I get really sad over small things wish I was nt an idiot
3296,"was doing fine for a very short time, everything's shit again","Antipsychotics were added to my prescription. Idk if that's how it all is supposed to work, but I kinda grew numb to bad things and ngl it was great. Having things happen without me breaking down and going on downward spirals was liberating.

It wasn't perfect, I still had bad thoughts, but they didn't suffocate me nearly as much which is great.

I don't know what happened today. I heard of a musician I admire attempting suicide and immediately had copycat thoughts, suddenly having the urge to chug down my own medicine. Why, when I was doing so well??

Tonight I had a conversation with a drunk friend. At first it was alright, nice even, but ultimately it ended up upsetting me and shaking me up badly. I cried like a little bitch. I'm so mad at myself, *I was doing well.*

Disordered thinking about eating and food also resurfaced, but as this isn't the sub for that I won't be getting into it.

I'm just really upset that all my progress, miniscule as it was, went down the drain so quickly."
3297,Life needs to stop kicking me in the gut when I'm already in the ground!!!!,"I just can't. I CAN'T. 

The last three months of my life have been horrible, to say the least. My pc is broken and i need a new one, but I can't afford it right now. Not even a super cheap one. 

The relationship with my mom is a disaster. I barely have a minimun wage job and she demands from me so much money. She suffers from mental illness, so I'm supposed to give her a pass. But honestly, I'm tired. I'M SO TIRED AND EXHAUSTED. She has a takecarer, but she harasses me at work. And when i get home... 

And yesterday i found that someone has been stealing my hardworking money and just broke down. 

Not going to talk about how stressful work has been. But i feel like I can't be anywhere now. Everything causes me extreme anxiety. 

I keep gaining weight because I don't know how to deal with my feelings.

I have a wonderful boyfriend, but he lives in another continent and I feel terrible when I tell him all of my problems. He has been, by far, the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love him so much and thats why I keep trying. 

I just want life to stop kicking me when I'm already in the ground. I JUST WANT A BREAK, PLEASE. BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG I'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP FIGHTING. I feel completely hopeless..."
3298,why do so many people suffer,"how many people  in our generation suffer from depression or sadness or just feeling shit in general, it’s fucked"
3299,I don't even have motivation or energy to do the things I enjoy anymore.,"Literally all I do is wake up, try to fall back asleep bc I don't wanna live through another day, masturbate, cry, mourn the death of my father and childhood, listen to music, lay in bed and never shower, go half the day without eating, buy a bunch of shit that will make me temporarily happy and say that I'll write music and make video games and one day make my living off it but never actually fucking do anything I say I will, and wish I was dead every god damn day."
3300,I hate my life,"My parents are constantly in my ear reminding me that im not enough and im stupid enough to believe it. They aren't supporting my college and are expecting me to pay for it this semester, which is virtually impossible at this point. I'm pretty sure I lost my scholarship because I didn't do as well as i should have this past semester. They tell me that ""college is too much"" for me, and are saying i should probably get a hourly wage job. Its only my first semester and i made mistakes, I know to not make those mistakes now, but Im not getting another chance. College is the only thing I want to pursue right now, I dont want to leave the university I attend now because I have already established myself. My parents never let me learn from my mistakes. They also always add on more consequences to face, besides the ones I have to face due to the mistakes i made. I have no support. I also suffer from depression. My parents have too much control over how I feel. Im honestly over it, but they have so much control over my life I really dont know how to escape. Im so over them and my life I kinda want to end it. I see no point or purpose going in this direction and I dont see a way out, either. I want to know how to gain control over how i feel and prioritize my opinion over theirs. Im constantly told that i am not enough or not worthy of something. They overstep boundaries. I have no room to grow. Im over my life at this point lol"
3301,Nothing makes me feel anything but misery,"Books, movies, games, achievement, failure, relationships, love: everything and everyone just makes me want to jump down a well"
3303,Even my workplace hates me apparently,"So I'm in university currently and I have a side gig at my professorship doing mundane shit for minimum wage (this is not uncommon  practice at my Alma Mater, and I can swing the amount of hours while doing my studies which helps pay the bills).

There's 2 other people in my classes doing similar jobs there, and they asked me yesterday if I'm going to the office Christmas party this Tuesday. I was unaware of this party being a thing, where every other goddamn employee of this fucking place and another closely related professorship is invited too. 

So not only am I an outcast within my classes (whole other story, not the point of this), my employer actually hates me too and solely excludes me from this dinner party (all-paid for btw)... How fucking lovely. Makes me honestly want to never leave my bed again. 

I've been considering quitting on Monday, I'm not sure yet. For now I think I'm just mad at myself for being such a failure, and I felt like I had to tell someone. So anyways, sorry for wasting your time, this has keeping me up the last 2 nights"
3304,When you have both depression and an eating disorder,"And you’ve finally reached the stage of being too depressed to eat👌👌👌

Wish this stage lasts a bit longer, it never does."
3305,bro depression is literally the worst,"the thing is, mostly, things in life are going good right now besides the weight gain from recovering from my eating disorder which has been really really hard. I am so uncomfortable with my body. but besides that, which truly takes up most of my thought process things are okay.

I just hate how depressed I am, nothing takes it away, no medicine, no “self care activity”, nothing, it’s just how it is and how it’s been for years and I’m so so over it :("
3306,This has to be rock bottom,I am sitting in my shop while my son and daughter are sleeping. My wife is inside and all I want to do is end this. I have PTSD. I have post concussion syndrome. I have anxiety and depression. I am the tension in my family’s life. I am the moods. I am everything they struggle with daily. Why should I stay. Why should I make them suffer me. Wouldn’t it be better to think of me before I was fucked up then living with what so am now.
3307,No one will ever love me.,"I'm 24 and I've never been loved by anyone, not my family or my friends. Ever since I was like 6 years old I have wanted a family of my own because to me family meant love despite what my own at the time made me believe.

But years later I've still yet to meet a girl who wanted something more than just 1 night of sex. The girls I have liked in the past no matter how I act with them or how much they seem to like me have done nothing other than string me along or mess with my feelings.

I just don't understand how I can be this age and despite all my efforts still be single and yet to find someone who likes me."
3308,I feel so pathetic,"I think of my situation and I just feel awful, like why am I even depressed? For example my mother works 5 nights a week doing 12 hour night shifts and yet I am at home leeching, quit my last 2 jobs because of anxiety, I am feeling extremely guilty and I am depressed. Like how selfish and unfair for me to claim I have issues right? I know I shouldn't invalidate my problems but I am just being objective, I have too much anxiety and fear of being judged that I can barley function in society and I think of suicide often, add that with being depressed and I just stay at home and do nothing all day, every day but yet I am the one who needs help? Well what about her? What about everyone else? I feel so pathetic. Like my issues are petty in comparison to everyone else's and I am just being selfish. I feel trapped though like the fear of having to work again (even though I am going to need to contribute again soon) just makes me so fucking scared because even though I am never comfortable, I am more comfortable at home being a fucking pathetic leech and feeling guilty than I am out their in the world. What a piece of shit right? I dont know what to do because I am going to need to contribute financially and I am too useless, too anxious, too depressed, too scared of life that I don't know if I can do that without one day killing myself. I am going to try and change in 2020... Maybe even work up the courage to go see a doctor and try and get meds. If the year go well I will go on another year. If not then I am terrified I will just take my pathetic life the moment I feel my life is more of a burden than my death will be. I don't know what to do, I feel as though my days are really numbered."
3309,Does anyone else suffer from nightmares?,"I have nightmares almost every night and it’s starting to affect me really badly. Most of the time I dream about bugs and spiders crawling in my bed and so I wake up screaming and have to go sleep on the couch. I googled around and found out that depression and anxiety and some antidepressants can cause an increase in nightmares, but since I can’t go without my medication or I’ll most likely jump off a bridge I have no idea what to do to stop them from happening. Anyone tried melatonin, and has it helped you? I know lots of people with sleeping problems use it to fall asleep but I feel like maybe it would help you fall into a deeper sleep and not have disturbing dreams? I’m at a loss right now and it’s scary to go to bed knowing I’ll most likely wake up scared out of my mind."
3310,just wanted to share some of my struggles...," I got bullied ever since kindergarten. I tried to be nice even if people were shitting on me. I wanted to be cool so I tried to copy the 'popular' kids- ended up struggling with finding out who I am. aways've been the odd one. being told I'm ugly all the time made me very self conscious. I started questioning my sexuality- and I still do. deep inside me I feel like I know the answer( might be bi) but my parents are homophobic so there is no way I would ever come out. I've been skinny since a young child, people would always comment on my weight and what I eat- ended up forming and eating disorder. aways have weird guys trying to flirt with me- right now is one of my classmates. speaking of my class that's 98% boys, in a weird way I feel like they dont see me as a person. I'm not hot enough to be attractive to most( not that I want to) and most of them are sexists so some of them act with me as if I'm just a nothing.

I'm just a teenage, how the hell am I supposed to keep up with all of this bs?"
3311,don’t want to reach out,i know it’s best to reach out to people. but i’m scared that if i tell my friends they will find me weird and invite me to stuff even less
3312,Deleted Social Media Accounts,"I'm feeling a lot better after deleting my Facebook and dating apps accounts.
The fact that I'm not seeking false friends attention anymore and that I'm not deluding myself a woman will be interested in me is liberating."
3313,"I think I’m depressed, or just very lonely.","I have a few friends I talk to, but I’ve lost contact with many more than just a few. I know I’m introverted and too shy to talk to people and hate it because I want to go out and do something on a Saturday night but have no one to ask to do anything. I did have plans tonight to go to a friends house with old classmates but most bailed and it was cancelled two hours beforehand after I drove 1&amp;1/2 hours to come out to attend. I have a place that I live in the area which I rent, but on weekends I like to stay home where I grew up to get away from this place where I stay Monday to Friday for work. I drove in for this get together and now it’s cancelled and I’ll be here all alone. My roommates are going out with their friend who came home from away, but I’m not invited. The roommates are my friends too but I guess they just want a girls night. Having this party being cancelled really made me think about my whole situation. How I’m working mon-fri, coming home after work to do nothing but lie down on my bed and sleep, go to work, repeat. I have no life and now that I’ve accepted a job elsewhere, I have to move again and to a more secluded community with little to nothing in the area to do. I’ll also be renting a basement apartment, alone. 

I just want friends to hang out and do stuff with. I want to actually do something in life than go to work, sleep, repeat."
3314,Help me understand this cause i feel im going to spiral down.,"This guy and I is in a special relationship. Right now our situation is very shaky. He has mentioned that he feels his depression is coming back. His treatment towards me changed now. He mentioned just let him be and just text regular stuff and not to discuss our problem. I try, but he just ignores me most of the time. He mentioned that his therapist said that he doesnt owe anybody anythings. It’s ok to have space and ignore people. I asked why he replies to others, his reasoning is because they dont get mad when they he doesnt reply. This is causing me extreme anxiety and depression as well. I feel like whatever i do it’s my fault. I tried to give him space and not get mad when he doesnt reply. But now i have to understand and ask him. That’s his answer. I don’t know where to place myself now. Sometimes I just wanted to sleep for a long time. Please help me understand."
3315,I actually fell for a scam caller and I can't believe it.,"I know all the tips and hints to them being a scam caller, but I completely missed every bit. Thankfully my bank sorted everything, but fuck me this is really messing me up. They had a phone number spoofed to my bank and all. I was in such a rush to get out the door when they called I just pushed through everything so quickly. Told them my card number in various steps, pin, account name, cvc. Looking back I'm mortified. I got home from the bank and just collpased on the floor. I can't believe I fell for it and hate myself for that. It's ruined my night, which coincidentally is the night of the big Christmas party I'm hosting that I've been cooking for two straight days for. I'm trying to power through and not let it get to me, but my disgust in myself and unbridled hatred of these scammers is winning. I never, ever wish harm on anyone - I'm in nursing school for God's sake. But these guys? I can actually see myself doing horrible things to these scum bags if I ever found them. They deserve every bit. 

It's just a giant mess of emotions here. I need a hug and a drink. Thanks for reading all the way down here if you did. Have a great holiday."
3316,What are your parents’ reactions whenever the subject of mental illness pops up out of nowhere?,My parents just try their best to ignore the subject. I love them but... oh well.
3317,It looks like I really hate myself,"Hey, I'm 28 years old and I consider myself a life failure. I started studies with considerable delay because of my mental condition. I managed to finish philosophy with honorable mention and 1st degree matemathics studies. My dream was to stay at the university. But I have kind of social phobia, so even though I'm on doctoral studies, I have no hope to achieve success here. My work is just not in the mainstream and I alone cannot promote myself properly. Anyway I always expect failure, so this makes it even harder. Even if you could point some of my life successes, I always find some excuse to make them insignificant.

Recently I started to work. It's quite well-paid job for someone who doesn't have any experience. It's quite interesting and I think that I can say that I have good (or excellent) relations with my coworkers. Still I can naturally find way to downplay that.

I live with my parents. I somehow cannot imagine to move out. I just cannot find any motivation. I'm alone in this world. Nobody really knows me and I don't really know anybody. I'm either sad, afraid or emotionless. Even right now when I try to stop bleeding from my stupid body. I wish I could die."
3318,PLEASE STOP THE PAIN,"I CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I AM SO TIRED OF LIVING. I JUST WANT GIVE UP. IT’S SO HARD CONSTANTLY HANGING ON TO FALSE HOPE. IT’S EASIER TO JUST STOP TRYING.

please... I just want to rest..."
3319,My boyfriend struggles with depression. How can I help?,I really want to be there for him. I just need help understanding a bit about it. If anyone who been diagnosed with depression could dm me so we could talk I would truly appreciate that more than you could know. Thank you.
3320,I need your help for my (hopefully not) final push,"Since I don't receive support from my family or friends, I really need any help with motivational suggestions to fight for my life because I am absolutely terrified. I'm really sorry about the long read, you can skip the ""background"" to get to the point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I am a 26-year-old male who has been struggling with depression/suicide for many years. (Diagnosed with severe depression in 2012 with two suicide attempts in 2015 and 2016). Every type of antidepressant I have tried has just made things worse. Therapists haven't really helped either as they usually just insist on me going on ""suicide watch"". I thought I had a pretty good handle on things, but recently, I am in serious trouble. I have severe sleep apnea, which I use a Bipap machine for, and I was diagnosed with narcolepsy (an incurable and degenerative disease), which has completely turned my life upside down as my condition gets worse and worse (it's increasingly difficult to stay awake). This has affected my ability to work as a mechanical engineer (I sometimes have to leave work early because I'm too tired or I'm on the verge of tears of frustration). I have been using prescribed adderall to keep me awake and to become numb to my depression along with weed to help me sleep and to go to bed ""happy"". I recently found out that a bunch of employees including the CEO and the head of HR have been constantly making fun of me for having to leave early even though I finish my work at night. They even refused a raise for me so I'm still living paycheck-to-paycheck. I live in an apartment in San Francisco with 3 other people who don't understand what I'm going through and who keep trashing the place, despite me asking them to help clean, which is significantly affecting my mood especially since I have OCD. Working out has been a huge help since it's directly correlated to my happiness, but because of the narcolepsy I'm getting too tired to keep at it, and I know it's only going to get worse. The narcolepsy/depression has also made it more difficult to maintain a social life - I have lost interest in dating and now my ""best friends"" won't even invite me to hang out with them anymore.

**Summary:** In summary, I'm stuck in a toxic work environment, in a toxic living environment, my family and I are not close at all, my friends are leaving me, traditional depression treatments don't work, my working out therapy is failing, I'm essentially doomed because of narcolepsy, and I have officially lost the will to live. The difference between now and the previous two suicide attempts is that I have thought and rationalized this for the past two years and I am quite content with it as I fail to see the point to continue on living especially if my condition will just get worse and worse. Every single day is so difficult to get through, I truly hate myself and my situation, and I've never wanted to consistently end my life so badly. I plan on going out like a retired sports player by quitting my job, donating my money, deleting my social media accounts, finishing my already-started will, then ending it underneath the stars (astronomy is my most favorite thing).

**Assistance:** Before I choose to die, I want to make one last effort at the start of 2020. This includes finding a therapist who specializes in narcoleptic patients, completely quitting adderall and weed, aggressively job searching that hopefully leads to better pay so I can move out of this apartment, and forcing myself to workout every day. If you guys have any suggestions on mood trackers, therapeutic tips like the ""cold shower method"", or anything else to help me in my last pursuit of happiness, I would be forever grateful. Please, help me. There's a little bit of me that's not ready to die yet."
3321,I just feel so dead sometimes.....,"So I mean I know I don't have it that bad. I go to college and I have food and shelter, logically I should not feel self pity and hatred but it just seeps up sometimes. I don't  even know why it happens and what it is tht I did wrong because it could be something as small as someone taking too long to respond, I'm a rational adult and I know there are things tht actually matter but it just fucks with my head so much sometimes and sometimes nothing bothers me like I hate tht im so bipolar sometimes and I hate admitting it. I used to live with my mom who was bipolar, I love her but I was tht kid who just knew when to not fk with her cuz I could just sense it. her being abusive and then turn loving the next day like nothing happened the day bfr was fucked up I always thought I wouldn't turn into that I kept telling myself since forever and I made sure I did everything i can and took every turn to not turn into tht person but everyday it just feels like I'm becoming more and more into her as I grow. It feels like the one thing tht I'm trying to outrun always catches up to me. I didn't even notice it until my gf pointed it out tht I'm a fkd up person and im terrible with my feelings and I don't know how to handle myself. It just fkn sucks that my life is like a wave and I have no control over it. It feels like my curves going down again and I just want to not go there cuz idk if I can handle it long enough for it go up. These days I feel like some parts of me are missing and idk how to find em, it always starts like this and slowly I just become more and more dead and become a zombie and move until I can't anymore and just stay in my room and starve and never get outta bed, wake up at 3 pm and can't wait to go back to bed and have random panic attacks, pushing ppl who actually care about me, ruin my work and classes. The worst part is the last time it happened I didn't have anyone. This time I have a gf who loves me but I just can't seem to be able to tell her. We talked about this, we cried, we agreed that id tell her about my feelings but I just can't seem to shake this feeling that I don't deserve her and she deserves better than my self pity and the one thing worse than depression is watching how your depression affect ppl tht u love.....I don't even know why I'm writing this, maybe it's a cry for help or I just need something to hang onto so I don't fall into tht pit. If u made it this far thank you for reading it means a lot to me ♥️"
3322,I finally cleaned my room.,It's been a mess for months. Just piles of clothes and hangers every where. I even matched my socks and changed my sheets to the nice warm winter ones. I haven't had the energy to do much lately but I'm happy I got something done.
3323,The Mountain,"  

I have seen the mountain near and far since I was a small child. We moved close to it when I was younger and since then I have lived varying distances from it. From afar it is part of the scenery, certainly not the only mountain in the local terrain. Up close it can be terrifying. It is dark, almost black, craggy and bare. It is large and ominous. It does not appear impossible to climb, though it does look like it would take days, maybe weeks… however as you approach it, what look like hand and foot holds seem instead, sharp and unforgiving. I was told when I was younger that there is a path; a long, winding path that tests even those well-trained. Basically, it is not insurmountable but the spirit reacts as if it so. 

Being this close to it, the logical respect I have for it is replaced by an overwhelming, unforgiving fear.

He wants me to climb it. A major is staring at a petty recruit in this moment. He is telling the recruit to climb the mountain. That recruit is me and my legs are shaking.

In truth, I have excelled in many aspects of training. I have begrudgingly earned his respect or so I had fathomed and hoped. I truly admire him, he is well put together, skilled, and never raises his voice. He is always in control and even when he says forceful things his volume is soft and controlled. Even now his casual words cut through me like a knife as he tells me to climb the mountain. 

“Climb the mountain.”  
   
 “Sir, I cannot climb that mountain, sir.”

“Why not recruit,”

“Because sir, my legs will not move and I have no strength in my arms.”

“Climb the mountain, recruit.”

“But…I cannot….” My voice falters, my chest and fingertips buzzing, and it feels as if a weight is sitting in my stomach.

“Why not?” he asks.

“I cannot make my body move. I am very ill. The clouds are rolling in and its going to rain, the rocks will be slick. If I climb the mountain I may die on that mountain.” 'Please don’t ask this of me,' I silently add.

He replies matter-of-factly, “You need to move your body like you have so many times before. You can not guess the weather but even so, wind and rain will not kill you. If the rocks become slick, grab them harder, take more care. You will not die on that mountain, so go climb the mountain.”

“Sir, I cannot climb that mountain. You see a whole person but in truth, sir, my legs have just fallen off, my arms are following…wait… there they went too. I am just a torso and a head.”

He shows no sympathy, he does not acknowledge what I have said. He looks at me and I can see he sees me whole. Arms in place, legs holding me up.

“Climb the mountain. I just want you to climb the mountain. You need to climb the mountain.”

His eyes seem unflinching. He once congratulated me on my accomplishments and now I feel that if I do not climb the mountain, he will judge me as insufficient. I know I cannot climb the mountain and so I get mad. I get mad at his impossible proposal. The truth is, I want to climb the mountain. It has been terrifying me since I was a child.

“Sir, how did you do it. How did you climb that mountain?”

He does not answer me.

“Surely you have climbed it, you must know how, can’t you teach me if you are so sure I can climb it, can’t you train me?”

He shakes his head.

“This is your mountain to climb. I never had a need to climb this mountain.”

“That…that can’t be true.” I say. Its looming right over us, its huge.

“My mountain was different,” he says, “It was not this difficult for me. You just put one foot in front of the other, you keep going till it is climbed.”

Deep down I know if he had climbed his own mountain it had not been easy for him but its important to him to appear different from me, stronger, not troubled by my fear of heights and physical inadequacies. I can feel the disparity between us.

I am crying now, I cannot wipe my eyes, my arms of course laying on the ground next to me.

“Recruit, are you an adult? Stop crying and climb that mountain. It will make a true soldier out of you.”

“If I climb that mountain then I will be above you and then I will be on the other side of the mountain away from you,” I say angrily.

I had not realized until that moment the implication of me climbing the mountain. His lack of empathy makes me want to put the mountain in between us. If I climb the mountain I can keep going afterwards, away from him. That would teach him, would it not? 

Even as I realize all this, I also realize he is trying to make me stronger and better. He is trying to make a proper soldier out of me , force me to be someone who can take care of themselves. This somehow hurts me to know.

“You need to have a mountain-climbing training course, apparently, to speak to an expert. Maybe take some supplements while you train and then you will be able to.” He advises.  
   
 “But you want me to climb it now. I cannot go be trained and climb it now at the same time,” I state, bewildered.

“You still need to climb the mountain.” He replies, not responding to the clash of the concepts and their timeline. 

“I tried to climb that mountain before,” I say softly realizing my arms and legs have in fact been attached the whole time.

“When I was a child and several times since then. I kept falling and each time I got injured worse. I fear that mountain to my very core, I believe it is the thing that will kill me.” I have laid my terror bare for him so he can understand.

“You need to climb that mountain, recruit.” He says once more.

“And if it kills me?”

“It won’t.”

But I cannot shake this fear and every time he tells me to climb the mountain, I feel more and more ashamed that I cannot even move a step towards it. Even though I see him, I start to wonder if the mountain has moved between us already.

“I’m sorry,” I say, “I love you and I’m scared and I’m ashamed that something is wrong with me, that a mountain lives in my mind and I cannot overcome it. I feel like I am losing the fact that you love me for who I am.” I do not know if I say these words or if he understands the ones that come out. They are always too many, always conditioned with too much emotion, the tone off-putting, the display of my internal tension probably repulsive.

It is silent and he reaches a hand to me across the bed in the dark. He takes my hand and softly caresses it.

“I just want you to calm down. I just want you to be better,” he says.

“Climb the mountain,” the Major says again.

The lowly recruit cannot but now knows that no excuse will be accepted, nothing in the situation will change and the best they can do is to remain silent about why they cannot climb the mountain. The argument is circular after all. 

If I can walk to the mountain, if I can start to climb it just a little, just enough to find a spot where I will fall apart in secret then that may satisfy him that I did the thing he needs me to do. Better I suffer then I make him hit his head against a wall trying to make me do what he needs me to so we can be together the way we want. I may go and hide there in that dark, fearful place, where I may be crushed by falling rocks and trapped in the mountain I cannot climb. If I can just get my legs to move.

I had a bad morning and wrote this and wanted to share it with those who will understand."
3324,I feel like Thanos just snapped,"I've never experienced this before, but I feel like I'm being dusted. Except it's really slow, like I'm losing 100 cells a minute. Has anyone else reached a point when they literally feel like they're just fading? That's what I feel like right now. It's not painful, and it doesn't feel like I'm dying. It just feels like I'm disappearing."
3325,I can't stop crying because I feel worthless,"I don't get it, I just don't get it, I've been crying quite often for the last couple weeks, and when I'm not crying, I'm about to cry. I feel like such a miserable worthless pile of slime. My peers are more successful and productive than I am. My friends who I don't talk to anymore are happier than I am. Actually, most people are happier than I am right now. I don't have any passions. I am not skilled. I pass my classes but I have a paralyzing fear of working. I hate being in public. I hate it when people see me. I feel ugly and shameful. Nobody loves or supports me. I try to be a good friend but nobody cares about me and it's probably because I'm not a good friend somehow. I read all these self help books and try to become a better person, but it doesn't work, it all falls apart, and I think it's because I'm inherently a worthless person. I just don't understand. Nobody loves me. I'm worthless. It's so overwhelming and I can't stop crying. I feel ok until I get out of bed. I just want to be normal. Why am I not normal? Why couldn't I have been normal?"
3326,Finally feeling slightly better after the absolute worst year of my life.,"It started when my ex of 4.5 years broke up with me at the end of 2018. I had moved thousands of miles to be with him and his few friends and family made up my entire social circle. I lost everyone. 

I struggled to make friends and became extremely stressed out due to school. I ended up having a psychotic episode and was involuntarily committed to a psych ward... Although I've struggled with mental health issues since I was a teenager, I never, ever thought I would experience that. 

After I was released, I was deeply suicidal and had to leave college and move back in with my parents. This year has been absolute hell.

I was unable to get out of bed for months. All I thought about was killing myself. I felt nothing but dread and panic in between the hollowness. 

I still feel terrified. I still think about suicide every day. Yet I don't feel like I absolutely need to die anymore. I'm trying. I hope things get better for all of us."
3327,idk what tf to do,I really want to fuckin die and i have nowhone to be there for me
3328,What’s keeping you alive right now,Just looking for some inspirations. Wanted to post this to r/askreddit but the previous sentence is perhaps a bit too morbid. Let’s not ruin regular peep’s days.
3329,Did anybody else discover anorexia is actually their way of disappearing?,Like I have always been an outsider and felt invisible maybe by starving it’s a way of literally fading away from everything
3330,My mom doesn’t seem to want me to get better..and ruins every accomplishment I make...,"I’m 25. Have been clinically depressed since about 19 after my dad died and got 1000x worse as it effected my schooling. I moved to live at home and finish up my last 3 semesters of school. I struggled with school more than anything and was about to give up for good or just kms. But last May I finally got the right meds and my life slowly started getting back on track. 

But my mom still just sees me as a depressed piece of shit with no plan or any idea how the world works. In the last 6 months I have lost 30lbs, took my last final to get my bachelors degree literally 2 days ago after 6.5 years in school with the best grades I’ve ever gotten. Keep in mind just about a month ago, I had a 35% in 2 classes. (Tried to tell her and she said “you’re not over worked, that’s life get used to it) So I talked to teachers, got help. And got them both up to 85% . I was feeling the best I ever have. I was proud of my accomplishments and hard work and excited to start the job hunt. But here comes my mom telling me how I am lazy and not any better than I was and takes everything I do as a sign that I’m spiraling or something again. I’m not gonna lie, the biggest issue has been me liking to smoke weed. It’s not excessive and at the end of the day after I have everything done.. but I do enjoy it quite a bit and do believe it has been helpful with my depression. it isn’t a problem until she finds out I am smoking. I have been working 2 jobs, finished school, and have a plan set for my future. So obviously it hasn’t been affecting me. She hadn’t even noticed anything until a couple days ago when she smelled it. 

I get it. She’s worried. But she has no idea what is going on in my head but assumes she does. Won’t listen when I tell her. Wants complete control. And only has negative things to say about any choice or decision I make. Never supportive. And just makes me feel like shit when I just accomplished the one thing that was making me want to put a gun in my mouth or take a hand full of pills for the last 5 years. It should have been a happy day. But now I feel just like I did a year ago. I hate getting guilt tripped into agreeing with her because she’s my mom. When I do say she is the one causing my problems now she cries and makes me feel like a crappy son. I’m just over it and don’t know what to do..I’m 25 and have to be able to make my own decisions to learn from my mistakes if I make the wrong one. Not her making them for me or waiting to say I told you so.. 

Like I’ve been depressed for 5 years, and have only been getting better for 6 months. Obviously I’m still gonna be “off” and not 100% better for a while until I learn how to fully love myself and am completely happy again. It will take time...she doesn’t get that either..it’s never enough"
3331,Wish I could skip the entire day and just go straight to bed,I just want to go to sleep instead of dealing with everything in life.
3332,I'm not cut out for anything. I'm worthless.,I'm worthless
3333,I feel like this is the end of the line for me. Not suicidal or anything but just tired.,"So lately I’ve been getting this hollowness in my chest , you know, like I’m falling into an abyss of misery. I just turned eighteen and I’m in my last year of high school. No I haven’t been bullied or anything but I feel like this is it for me. Not death or anything but just living. Like no more living. Just surviving. It’s been about a year since I started feeling this."
3334,I actually reached out for help,"Last (school) year was when I majorly started suffering with depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts but my English teacher at the time helped me more than I can thank him for. I used to talk to him almost every two weeks but I stopped because of the summer and haven't talked to him since because I didn't want to bother him. I really hate my home life and wish I was dead nearly everyday but I put off talking to him even though he makes sure that I know he's available. This afternoon I finally emailed him to see if he could talk to me and I feel like a weight lifted - just waiting for a reply now"
3335,"Have a Merry Christmas, for me","Hey gentlemen/gentleladies, wishing you all a happy Christmas season, even if you aren't fortunate enough to have any family members who care about you. Don't hurt yourself, don't hurt others, take solace in the fact that you're alive and have an internet connection.

Days go by, bygons become bygons. And if you're open minded and decide to stick around long enough, I'm positive you will find something that makes you happy.

Once again, regardless of your age, race, religion, political compass or past, here's to you having a happy Christmas season"
3336,Missing my “toxic” relationship,"My last relationship was considered awful and toxic by everyone around me, but I struggle to call it that even now... but I can admit to things I know weren’t right.. 

He made me feel guilty when ever I talked to any of my friends and I ended up not talking to any friends because it was easier than having him upset and angry by it, he would go through my phone when I was sleeping and make me feel like the worst person ever over a conversation I had with someone years before I was with him... he was always accusing me of sleeping around and doing things behind his back and lying to him, he’d always say that I’m going to dump him even though I said I never would.. but despite it all I don’t want to call it toxic, I still know I was happy in that relationship, and I miss it with all my heart. 

But I didn’t leave him, ironically everything he accused me of doing he ended up doing to me.. 

After 2 years he broke up with me, he had lived in my family home the whole time and it was a big deal for everyone when he left. 

Even after he broke up with me he continued to tell me I was the most amazing person he’d ever met, we acted just like any couple, we went out for dinner, went to the cinema, hung out multiple times a week, stayed over and had sexual relations, I even still told him I loved him. Even though he would remind me a lot that it wasn’t a relationship, I naively though that he just needed some time to be “single” before committing to me... he gave off that impression when he broke up with me in the first place.. 

This went on for just over a year, then last week he told me he was seeing someone else now. I’m heartbroken and angry and frustrated all at the same time, but mostly I just have this heavy numb all over. He told me this a day after trying to get nudes of me so he was already being unfaithful to this new girl. He wanted to stay friends and it took my whole being just to tell him no, it was so heart wrenching, he was my best friend as well as everything else. 

Something that drives me nuts is that he still said I’m the best person he’s ever met... whilst with another girl... it just makes me think that if someone who thinks so highly of me can’t love me then who can?? 

It’s been 6 days since I cut him out and it’s been ridiculously hard, everything reminds me of him, all the things I used to enjoy make me feel anxious and sad. So many of my memories are of him and they’re sour and make me feel so lost. My self esteem is so low I struggled with depression before this happened and my work life is really awful and unstable at the moment, my boss has practically threatened suicide if I leave the workplace so even when my doctor signed me off with depression I continues working to make sure she was okay.. I used to talk about my work issues with my ex because I trusted him but now I just deal with this on my own.. 

I don’t feel like I have any close friends to ask help from, I see a therapist and am on antidepressants but it’s not the same as having the support from someone who isn’t paid to listen to you... 

I’m trying to keep myself busy but thoughts of him and what he’s doing with another girl keep invading my mind, I’m doing all I can not to go on his Facebook or message him and I’ve been successful so far, but I keep getting angry and frustrated that I can’t tell him how I feel.. I just know I’ll be back to square 1 where I couldn’t even get out of bed if I message him. 

I just wanted to vent this out anonymously, thanks"
3337,i need motivation,"the love of my life and i broke up a few months ago and yesterday we quit being friends entirely, i saw it coming but it still hurts. Ive been laying in bed for the entire day, i havent eaten or drank anything in about 30ish hours. Any time i try i feel worthless, eating or drinking anything makes me feel like i dont deserve it, like I dont deserve it. This person meant everything to me and when we were breaking up,, they treated me like i meant nothing to them. Like i was a piece of gum stuck to their shoe and they wanted to get rid of me, wanted nothing to do with me, disgusted by me. We dated on and off for 4 years. They have multiple mental diseases, along with bipolar and at least as far as i can tell, tho they havent been diagnosed with it, are a sociopath. They lack any empathy or compassion for anyone other than themselves. We have been through hell together, mainly me being there for them and not here for me. I caved to demands made of me to make them happy, i let the peer pressure get to me and i lost who i was because of it. I wanted to be with them so much that i let them walk over me and degrade me. I lost my dignity to make them happy. I put them over myself and now that theyre gone theres this void inside me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know who i am anymore, i dont know where to go from here i dont know what to do. i dont know how to look for help or make new friends. The last 4 years of my life revolved around this one person and theyre gone. I turn 21 in 11 days and i ws hoping that they would at least be around to tell me happy birth day this year but theyre not. Of the 4 years we knew each other we dated on and off constantly and during that time they only told me happy birthday the same year we met. Every other year we were seperated and they didnt talk to me. Outside of that one year i dont even remeber the last time someone told me happy birthday, and now i dont even get that. 11 days away and the love of my life was like yep hate your guts, fuck off. I just dont know anymore. im not going to kill myself but inside im already dead. I dont want to be alive anymore i just want to die. 

&amp;#x200B;

The shock of the breakup itself is over but i just need someone to talk to me and try to motivate me to do something, anything. Ive been in bed for 16 hours and only gotten up once to pee. I need help. Please."
3338,To anyone struggling,On this platform my way of coping was from making my own community and writing about problems in my life as well as looking through the ones in this community! Sorry if that’s not helpful😅
3339,I have a problem with losing and forgetting things.,"Like I recently lost my airpods, or how I often forget about deadlines or meetings that I have."
3340,I need some help,"Let me put my feelings into song format.
I feel like I’m worthless 
I’m starting to get breathless 
Crying at night
It’s every night 
Thoughts getting too dark it’s starting to feel like my trademark.
Suicide thought running through my head like they’re king.
But I really can’t cope anymore
I start to collapse and fall on the floor with all these thoughts with no restrictions"
3341,Everyone in my peer group is doing amazing things and I feel like I can’t even handle basic bullshit (rant),"I’m 24 and I hate everything about myself.

I’m trying really hard to look in the mirror and not cringe but I can’t bring myself to love who I am. I hate myself. I think I’m terrible in every way. 
I lie, I don’t take care of myself, I haven’t felt anything but numbness or sadness in so long I’m not sure exactly how to feel anything else. I have manic episodes every so often but even then, I don’t really feel anything.

I live with my mom, I’m trying to get a job and move out with my SO but every time I look at an application or an email I think of all the times I’ve applied to places that turned me down. I think of all the ways I failed in school, in past jobs, in life, and I just can’t bring myself to even look at it because I’m probably not good for the job anyway. I’m on medication but it only works part of the time and it keeps me from loving myself or anyone else. I feel like I don’t even love my partner as much as I want to. 

My family and my SO have so much faith in me and I feel like I let them down with every breath I take. I’m a fat, lazy, stupid, ugly, terrible, person. I don’t have any friends because why would someone like me have friends? I have my family, and I have my SO, and that’s it. I don’t know how to be friends with people, I want to have friends I desperately do but I’ve never kept a friend for more than a couple years before we have some explosive fight or just stop talking. Every friend I’ve ever had has chosen someone else over me and at this stage of my life I guess I understand that it’s because I’m nothing special. I’m so painfully average and so dull, people would rather have anyone else. And honestly? I wouldn’t want to be friends with me either. 

I have a useless degree in theater, I have no desire to pursue anything on most days and I’m sick of being myself. I feel like the sim character someone made to be a miserable piece of garbage until they finally die in an entertaining fashion."
3342,Had all I can take,When you've reached your breaking point &amp; just can't take it anymore what do you do? Where do you go? All I know is I want to get as far away from here as I can. I want to lose contact with everyone in my life including my family. Basically I just want to disappear. The only thing holding me back is money. I can either just pack a small bag &amp; start walking or it just end life period. I hate feeling this way ugh.
3343,Sometimes I want to dunk my head into a bucket of water and stop feeling,"Sometimes the episodes are so unbearably overwhelming and I just imagine dunking my head into a bucket of water and not seeing or hearing anything, and also not thinking and feeling anymore. 

It's just too much.
I want it to stop."
3344,I don’t know what I’m doing,"Well I’m back here. For starters I’m basically living off my parents, I have no money and no job. I’m looking but nothings coming my way. Right now I have taken the title “family disappointment” cause I feel like a failure. I have no motivation to do anything but stay at home. I want to paint and do my usual stuff and try to make things to sell but again I have no motivation or my mind goes blank and I get frustrated. 

I even been looking for an SO but i don’t think I should. I’ve met two great guys. But one is going through some family and mental issues right now and the other hasn’t talked to me since we met up. I want someone to love me and let me love them but The ones who do want me, want me for sex and only sex. 

I keep dreaming that maybe one day I’ll be successful enough to have my own house and someone who actually loves me but I fear it’s just going to be a dream. 

I have days where I don’t want to exist anymore and I think everyone would be better without me around. 

I don’t know how to move past this."
3345,SSRI is working; increase dose or wait it out?,"I started taking setraline about 7 weeks ago. Week 4-6 was where it really picked up and my anxiety/depression improved a lot and those pesky side effects mostly stopped.

Went back to my doctor and she said you can continue on the same dose of 50mg or increase to 100mg(normal dose)

I did ask if I can increase dose because I felt there was still room for improvement

However, a week on the higher dose and the side effects are back so i took the 50mg tonight because i kind of regretted it.

Was 6 weeks to early to tell if i would have improved more?

I heard 8 weeks is a good time to wait.

Anyway for now im going back to 50mg sticking with it till new years then will reasses.

couldnt see my usual doctor and felt let down by the new one...she didnt seem to know that much.

Anyway was wondering if anyone has advice/experience on this.

thanks"
3346,I miss her so much i hate myself..,"When i first saw her i thought she was the one and after that we were so happy together..But then she broke up with me because  
she couldn't deal with a relationship and she said she didn't loved me anymore..And i don't understand why..I asked if she found some other guy..and she said that she just felt uneasy around me.I just don't fucking understand what did i do that made her feel like that,i was always for her when she needed me,i always made time for her,i showed her so oft how much i loved her,i did everything for her and i'll still do,she was my top fucking priority,and she always looked so happy..And now every time i look in the mirror i just hate myself and think how could make her feel uneasy or what did i fucking do,and i just want to beat myself up for not being good enough for her.i just love her so much and i really fucking miss her."
3347,I have nobody in my life who's better off for having known me...,
3348,"Do you ever feel like you're smiling and laughing and actually having a good time, not just faking it, but the depression is still there all along?",It's like there's a void in my heart that wants to drag me back into breaking down
3349,My mom embrrassed me at dinner with my problems.,"So my mom embarrassed me in front of her friend today. It was dinner time and my leg was bouncing, now if you don't know this, it's a symptom of anxiety, especially since I'm currerntly going through some work issues right now. This probably shouldn't suprise you all, since anxiety is correlated with depression. She says I'm shaking all of my body, like I was an elderly, sickly and weak (I wasn't, only my leg). I don't give two shits about her friend but I prefer that I don't have my mental issues shown like that to other people. She proceeds to call me a game addict, criticizes me for not having a girlfriend (because deep down she's desperate for grand children and social ""norms"") and for not having IRL friends even though I have fucking socializing issues and I can't talk to people. Then makes a scene, starts crying and whimpering, making the room so awkward to stay in and calls my dad. Hysterically, she says that I'm weak, need to get checked in even though I'm already being followed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist. I feel so ashamed and wish to off myself."
3350,I think some people notice I'm not alright and it scares me,"I'm afraid my friends are starting to notice that my depression is getting worse. They don't know that I have it to begin with. Whenever we meet, when we say goodbye they always say: ""well I 
- really- do hope that you enjoyed our time together."" And then look at me as if they want some kind of confirmation. They never did that before and this concerns me a lot. This has been happening ever since the day this week I got some terrible news and my general mood has dropped significantly lower than it already was and I've been more quiet ever since. And it's not just friends that know each other who do this but friends from totally different groups. It's scaring me quite a bit."
3351,I don’t have a future anymore,"Rejected from my dream school two days ago. 
I have nothing left. 
I’m not good enough for any college on my list. I’m smart, but from an area with a high volume of applicants like myself. 
I have nothing. I don’t think the rejection is a reflection of me, I’m sad because my future was taken from me. 
I saw myself somewhere. I had a dream school. I’ve killed myself for the past four years to get into my dream school, whatever it would be. I deserve this. I deserve it as much as anybody, maybe even more so. But it’s just not a possibility for me. 
My parents are making me do a binding, early commitment to another school they like. 
I’ll get in nowhere if I don’t take this offer, but I’ll be miserable. I’ll have nothing. 
Contemplating suicide. I probably won’t do it. I can’t destroy my family’s lives like that. What do I have left? I have no future. 
My parents are abusive, but they’re stressed, and they mean well. 
Should I just go through with it? I don’t have any future anymore. It’s my parents’ future, it’s someone else’s. Every minute feels like a nightmare I wish I could wake up from. 
I hate this. I was depressed before, but now I’m broken."
3353,The last straw,"I just bit my tongue eating so hard that it bled. Sure it hurt a lot. But I just spent 10 minutes sobbing like an idiot. 

Depression is an interesting thing. It was all ok today. I was stressed out this week immensely and I was trying to not let things get to me. It was like everything was going wrong and I couldn't even be upset about it. Adulthood I guess. Today was supposed to be such a great day. I had plans with friends and I was hosting the get together at my place. But it didn't happen. It was postponed- not even cancelled but it was just the cherry on top of a horrible week. I am still in my PJs. I haven't done much at all. And it just took a bleeding tongue to cause me to have a total meltdown and ugly cry in front of my cats. It is funny now but I still don't feel very stable. 

It feels better to write it down and let it out. My tongue is numb- gotta be grateful for the little things."
3354,"Do you ever feel like you are smiling and laughing and actually having a good time, not just faking it, but the depression is still there all along?",
3355,My Tourette’s make my social experience difficult,"Due to my Tourette’s diagnosis it’s impossible for me to be social. Whenever I talk to somebody I either shout at them and make them sad or mad or whatever, or I keep doing weird tics which makes me unable to get any “partner” because everybody thinks I’m weird. And my Tourette’s limits doesn’t stop there. It leaves me worrying about EVERYTHING. I can’t do anything in my life without worrying about the bad things that could happen. This doesn’t make my life easy and because of this I have no friends no matter how hard I try. And my Tourette’s hasn’t gotten better. I can’t be social and I almost can’t live a great life.



THIS kind of Tourette’s = hard depression for people like me."
3356,My family would rather I pretend to be happy rather than actually getting better,Whenever I appear depressed or sad my family is always surprised like it’s the first time they found out I have depression. They know I am depressed but they just don’t care. They always get mad at me and ask me why I am being so negative. They will call me ungrateful and tell me that I want to be depressed. Only way they will accept me is if I pretend I am happy.
3357,I failed school,"I failed school. I failed school.

There is nothing for me anymore.

I don't have a life anymore.

I failed school. I failed basic education. 

There are no open doors for me.

There is no hope for me.

I failed school.

I failed school. There is no life for me anymore.

I am nobody now, forever.

I don't want to work shitty jobs and suffer.

Why?? Why did this happen? Why did I let this happen?

What do I do now?? What do I do??

What do I do??

Where is my life now??

My only life. It's ruined forever. 

My one fucking life. Ruined. Because I failed school.

I wish I could go back and get myself aborted."
3358,Stupid,"Cut myself a couple of months ago for the first time, as the wounds healed, kept cutting.
Now i have scars and I just hate myself which only makes me want to go on.
 
I dont know why I’m like this"
3359,Cause for concern?,"Hey all.  This is my first post in any sort of mental health related sub, and I'm not entirely sure if it belongs here but I'm also not sure where else I should ask about what's been going on with me lately. 

So these things have happened periodically throughout the last couple of years, but lately I'm noticing them more and more as they've been consistent for the past 6 weeks or so.  I'm starting to isolate myself and just do nothing when generally I would want to be out doing things.  I've had plenty of social opportunities come up and I have consistently turned them down, and have wanted to be alone for really no particular reason.  I feel like I don't have the energy to keep up a conversation beyond small talk, and am becoming increasingly apathetic about many things in my life.  I also have a lack of interest about a lot of things that I would normally enjoy or want to learn about.  I'll try to get something going but will quit after a few minutes as if it's just not worth the effort.  I'll also have bouts of mild anxiety, which will make it difficult for me to sleep at times, but it's nothing severe or debilitating beyond that.  I feel as though I'm never 100% present.  My mind is wandering and it's difficult to organize my thoughts when I have to convey them verbally or even something like this post.

I've tried to force myself to do things like get out and socialize but I keep flaking out at the last minute and going right back to doing nothing.  I'm still able to go to work, pay bills, keep up with working out, and eating properly.

The reason I'm starting to be a bit concerned is because I know that these are symptoms of depression.  The only thing is I'm not sad most of the time and I'm still able to keep going about my life, even if I'm just going through the motions.  I will get down from time to time but not nearly to the extent where I would immediately think ""depression.""

Has anyone felt similar?  Is this something I should think about seeing somebody for?  Any help would be very appreciated"
3360,I feel like I never ever will be loved again.,"I hate this feeling, and I have this the whole time, and I think most of the time about it. I’m 17 years old, and yeah, I know I’m young and I have so much experiences and relationships to make still, this tells me everybody, but...around 3 month ago I left my girlfriend, because we were just arguing nearly daily, and it just sucked, I was together with her for 2 month. It was my first relationship ever. 

But I’m introvert, and If I get into a conversation with a person, I just don’t say that much and I often just can’t talk it feels like the words stuck on my tongue. When I get into a conversation with girls that I like, I often can talk more, but somehow I feel like a ugly, shy, insecure piece of shit, and I feel like this will never ever get better. 

When I had a girlfriend 3 month ago, my depression weren’t gone, but I felt so much better; I felt better than ever before, and I spent the best days and nights within my life with her till now. But I think no girl will ever like me because, how should I get into a conversation with a girl? I mean 2 weeks ago, there was one girl, and in the end I asked for her number, and she gave it to me, but when we wrote after a few minutes it sounded like she doesn’t wanted to communicate with me anymore, sooo, I didn’t wrote her again since that moment.

I hate myself for being like this!
I don’t wanna be like this!

I just hate it. And many people just don’t understand introverts and how it is to be one, and many also don’t want to accept the matter of fact.

Being an Introvert isn’t nothing bad, but ooff, why do I have to be like this?"
3361,How do I stop social anxiety and get out of my bubble?,
3362,Yesterday I cried at work because of a single pic my friend sent in a group chat,"I am 22m. The pic was sent by my friend who supported me once when I was very upset with something. She is a good and kind person, but recently she broke up with her boyfriend and she sent a pic in a group chat which stated something like this:

""Level of man's attractiveness by woman's standards:
1. Stylish and fit - 40%
2. Clever and funny - 55%
3. Makes good money - 90%
4. Not a programmer - 99%
5. Answers with sarcasm to her sarcasm without being offended like a crying scum - 10000000%""

And guess who was offended like a crying scum.
I understand and use sarcasm frequently and I knew it was just a joke, I knew that she worried and cried because of her ex, but I was so mad at her that I wanted to confront her, quit the group and never speak to anyone.

All my life I have been behaving like this towards people I cared about. I want to stop this. I pushed away so many people by upsetting with them over minor arguments.

I have also noticed that I envy happy and successful people. Especially those, who had decent parents and their own rooms in childhood, because I have lived in a 1-room apartment with my stupid parents almost all my life and I still do. I know that those people don't deserve such attitude, but I just can't help it.

Is there any way to fix this apart from suicide? I seriously consider this as an option because I am too tired and anxious from everything, but that would hurt my friends.

Sorry for bad English and for feeling sorry for myself."
3363,I ruin every relationship I touch by not thinking I’m worthy of someone caring about me,
3364,I’m done with everyone and everything,"People act like there’s some age limit to be depressed, and you can’t understand depression until you’re 20. I don’t want to do anything but sleep, I love my computer but I don’t find it fun; everything seems boring and monotonous. I wish there was someone who I could love and to be around, but I’m ugly and well no one likes people who are ugly. Every day feels the same and boring, I can’t find ways to describe what I feel so I use others words and I think that a not the right way of describing it."
3365,I really don't know what to do,"I'm so tired of life. I (m 22) broke off my relationship like a year ago, my ex clearly moved on but I didn't. I don't even think that's it's the fact that I didn't move on, it's just that I can't do better, I get virtually no matches on tinder even though I think I'm above average. I didn't have any friends remaining after my 3 year relationship. I'm done with college and missed out my college life to working full-time alongside college and a relationship, it's hard to even meet new people anymore. My ex was my best friend and really it's been so so so lonely without any real friends after that.

I really don't know what the fuck to do anymore.

This has been a horrible couple of years for me, this year - I tried starting a business but I don't have the capital to even get the initial traction/to get the ball rolling. I haven't been able to find any girl who I like. I live with my family, which is my parents and one sister and there's never peace in the house my elder sister who is approx 30 31 really has some issues and there really hasn't been peace in the house for the last 5 10 years. I'm really not exaggerating when I say that there are screaming battles and violence's in my house almost on a daily basis, imagine growing up with that. I so want to move out, but have to decide whether I need to get braces and other fix my insecurities and not move out because I can't afford both that and rent. Or move out and live with my fucking insecurities because my parents were barely ever there for me and never solving any of my problems unless it was an emergency in their eyes. Nevertheless therapy is out of the option because I obviously can't afford it, or as my dad says, if insurance doesn't cover it, no need to think about it. And to be honest, my dad is the only semi sane one in my family, my mom and sister really have some sort of mental issues. Their just so fucking violent, nagging all the time, hate each other's guts and just never peaceful.

I have no real friends, just fake friends or as I'd like to call them, acquantainces. I can't even hang out with them, due to the same reason I couldn't hang out with them before my relationship - I cannot afford to. It just seems like everyone's born with a silver spoon up their ass and my family can't even afford to provide with basic shit let alone money to go clubbing or to concerts or bars on a weekly basis. I'm really sorry for acting so salty but after dealing with this for 22 years and never really getting anything I've ever wanted, I think it's a fair reaction.

I just need advice on how to restart my life, what should I prioritize - moving out and treating myself and fixing my insecurities, like my fucked up teeth, my weight etc. Oh another icing on the cake is that after being active in the gym and an active lifestyle, I've been diagnosed with permanent weakness in my wrists which means I can't do simple shit like pushups for atleast another year or two. There's never any healthy food in my house it's all oil, seems like no one gives a shit about their own health and definately not their kids.

Here's how I picture myself after 3 years, I'm a successful entrepreneur, moved out with my own studio, treated all my insecurities which my family members have neglected all my life, go to therapy consistently, and repair the last 22 years worth of scars.

How do I do this? I really am tired of waiting. For the last week, I think I've lost all hope, been sitting home watching HIMYM, day dreaming about when I'll find the one for me (I'm not interested in flings, I just want reliability) and sleeping. I used to be on fire for all the months before the last one or two, working 18 hours a day on my startup, but I've just been so demotivated lately and want to fix my fucking life.

Sorry for the huge ass post."
3366,Disassociated all day at work..,"All I wanted to do was run as far away from work as possible. My body was present , but my mind was not. Like, whenever a costumer tried to conversate with me my mind turned off. I knew I was talking,  but couldn't hear myself talk. It was horrible. The worse part about that experience was I couldn't leave or take a break.. I work by myself most days( 9hrs).. I felt trapped.."
3367,How do I cope with crippling feelings of loneliness?,"When I get really low with my depression, one of the worst things I experience is insanely strong crippling loneliness. I’m currently staying at my parents house away from all my friends etc. Even though I have people to talk to, I have a girlfriend who I’m texting, my parents and my brother are all in the house, I just can’t bring myself to properly communicate with anyone. I have this horrible, crushing feeling in my chest of just despair and anxiety. I’ve tried doing things by myself that I enjoy, playing video games, playing guitar etc but nothing works. I’m just laying in bed crying to music. In the past I’ve gotten really drunk or done drugs to cope with these feelings but that’s something I’m trying really hard to avoid at the moment. What do other people do when/if they have these feelings?"
3368,I don't belong here,"why the hell am I still alive? I ask god daily to please just take me away from this place I should have died 3 times already. I don't fucking belong here. then I see my kids, they are the only reason I am alive, who would protect and guide them through life if I'm not here? that thought scares me, because the world is dangerous and no-one will protect them like I would. but some days it just feels like it would be better if I wasn't here. I'm almost completely deaf, so its not like I hear anything, I'm an addict in and out of recovery, I'm owning up to my mistakes with the law, 1 year house arrest and 2 years probation, If I fuck up I will go to prison. I've already had a fuck up for failing a drug screen, I can't have anymore, and I tend to use at the wrong times. I am not a bad person. I just don't fucking belong here and I can feel it and its killing me inside. No-one understands me."
3369,Turning 18,"I turn 18 in two weeks- At the start of the year I tried to leave this world behind. 
Since then my life has changed and I am happier than I have ever been- everything sorted itself out from a place where I thought that wasn’t possible

It does get better 
I can’t believe I made it to 18- Please remember it will always always get better."
3370,20:53 UK and already in bed and tired. Great life,
3371,Asking on behalf of friend,"How to pass a psych eval? 
Specifically what will the psychiatrist be looking for"
3372,"Privileged,surrounded,loved","I have felt depressed sad lonely when I have a girlfriend of almost four years , grew up upper middle class, still living good just nothing seems to fill like an emptiness, crippling anxiety everyday , fight off panic attacks frequently, I have parents that love me but I always feel so alone and numb , I have went through a lot of stuff whilst being privileged ect , when I was 14-16 lots of Xanax , drinking , and pain I went through with family stuff , idk not looking for sympathy, I know millions have it worse this is just a long story short of me , NO IM NOT SUICIDAL never would do that , never think about it , just wondering if there’s ever gonna be a time in my life where I feel normal , no anxiety , no like just feeling down and out or burnt out on life when I have so much more to live .. anyways if you read thanks for the look"
3373,People keep accusing me of stuff,"I created a mental health subreddit a while ago, which I have been advertising a bit to try to help people, though sometimes people just accuse me of doing it for attention. I don't even know what to do. Different people keep telling me that I should stop it and to stop trying to look like such a good person. They tell me to stop looking for attention. But I don't give a shit about attention, though everyone just keeps accusing me of trying to look like some kind of saint.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I'm just trying to help others and people feel a need to accuse me of stuff that isnt even true. I try to help others with their depression but now it's taking a toll on me and my own depression is getting worse. Can someone just tell me what to do and how I can deal with this?"
3374,I feel like I will be unable to survive on my own after divorce,"I have had lifelong depression, untreated for most of it. I just never took care of myself when it mattered. After 12 years of relationship its come to the end. my wife has been emotionally detached from me for years, and I STILL did not take action to fix it. This last week she dropped the hammer, told me I need to start figuring out another place to be. It sent me into a mental crisis, I am in unbelievable pain and also terrified of how to move forward. years of depression led to me isolating myself, she was my only friend. i wore her out and killed it. she did her hurting over this years ago, shes moved on already and i am just beginning.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I have family, but if i move to them i lose my job, my therapist, and medication that is starting next month. if I stay, I have a twisted support system because she is being so caring about me as a person, but then i see her having fun and developing new relationships while i am in pain. she gives me hugs and lets me be physically close at night so im able to calm down enough to sleep. I know i shouldnt rely on her to help me but i really truly have nobody else to turn to in the moment. she says she is willing and even my therapist said not to feel bad for taking that help, but i still do.  
&amp;nbsp;  
If I move out and stay local, i am 100% isolated and i cant fathom facing that aloneness right now. I cant afford to go socializing, i dont know anybody outside work, I cant afford to live without roommate so i will be breaking down near a stranger. Therapist says to try and have fun, the only fun i had in the last month was playing WoW with my wife until this came to a head. i havent logged in for over a week, every moment i am not intensely focused on some task i am just trying to not throw up.  
&amp;nbsp;

3376,This society will rip you up and grind you down until there's nothing human left in you.,"The last couple months I've been talking to a girl, we had a long distance relationship basically, and she gave me something I'd never had before. She made me feel safe and wanted and loved, things I never got to feel before. She made me happy. But I never got to come see her, we talked about It all the time, I'd come see her and when I finished school maybe I'd move to her city. She really seemed to want that.

But Poverty took that from me.

I never got together the cash to see her and she told me she found someone else today.

I had the shit luck of being raised by a severely depressed, hard working single mother. The one mistake of having children and then divorcing ruined her life and forced her to do nothing but hard labor, for little pay, and it only worsened her condition over the years and in turn I had to grow up poor and feeling alone in a broken family. 

If you're born Into a broken family, you will be broken. If you are born into poverty, you will be poor. There is no support in this society. 

The first time I consciously realized I felt disconnected from others was at 5, the first time I wanted to kill myself was at 11.

Throughout my entire life, school, work, socially, I've been expected to perform, the message society gave me was clear:

No matter what you're going through, one slip in productivity and you'll end up like your mother.

So i went through the stresses of school, of working 18 hours in a day, while dealing with my mental issues and my self harming and my substance abuse issues, hurting and numbing myself because there is no support for people like me, we're expendable.

And after going through heartbreak and a mental breakdown and trying my hardest to keep up with school while also working on myself, I finally get to a point of relative happiness, feel what it's like to have someone care about you and then I lose it again.

I'm just broken. I can't keep doing this, being ground between the stress of this system and the broken psyche I inherited from people who were previously broken by this society. 

But there is no salvation from this hell, not in this life. The options are suffering or suicide. 

Guess I'll have to make a decision."
3377,Depression.,I'm 14 freshmen in high school. I'm lonely I have some friends but I tell they dont give 2 shits about me.  We are so  much debt  there's not going to be much of a christmas. I want die. But I can't bring myself to do it.
3378,Worried that my depression is permanent,"I feel like a few years ago I still had a chance to get out of my depressive state, but now I feel like I passed the point of no return. It’s impossible for me to get better now."
3379,Coping Mechanisms,I don't cut myself. I bite my wrists. I'm so scared to actually cut myself on purpose. It started when I was younger but I didn't really understand why I was doing it. It was more of an automatic thing. I thought about using an elastic band and snapping it but I thought it would be do obvious. So I just bite down really hard around my wrists. And I was just wondering if anyone else did this or something similar. I think about cutting myself but get scared and I feel like I would go to far.
3380,I feel like an outcast.,"i cant deal with this shit anymore, everything i do is fucking weird and people get weirded out by me, people laugh at my look and my movements, im eating very healthy and im not fat but im just slow, im slow to catch things and im pretty sure i have social anxiety, im always trying to prove people that im better then i am even though im proving myself time after time that i am not, i can deal with the fact that im weird but it hurts me that people laugh at that, its not my fault that i was born like that, im not even complex im just outright a weirdo, and i never did any drugs or such and such mistakes that will make me like that, im just trying to be me, im trying to get better every day but there are days when it hits me and its worst then a kick to the nutz, its just this shivering cold i get on my body and im getting cold no matter how many cloths i were, and my body fucking hurts, all the time, my throat my tired eyes, my belly, its all pain, i want to write songs for living but nothing inspires me, i compromise for women i do not like because i do not like myself and thats how i feel safe, i got so many no's just because i always act like im trying to be better and people catch on that shit and it makes them think that you are instantly worth less then you are, people say that drugs numb the pain but the pain i feel right now no drug can numb, its too deep in heart, i want, NEED to kill my self but its a selfish act that no one should do and i do not want to hurt my mama, i do not have any friends that will give 2 fucks if i day and only my mama loves me because she thinks she have too, my nose is broken, i have 2 tons of bags under my eyes which makes me look like im 80, i have all sorts of weird shit on my face and the 1 women that wanted to fuck me did it because i go went to gym and my body not sloppy as it used to, now i dont go to gym so even that option is out of the way, im so fucking done."
3381,I don’t know whats going on.,"I’ve had anxiety for over a year, I’ve been able to cope with it, but now, I just suddenly feel worse. I don’t know if I’m starting to suffer from depression, I’m starting to just feel like life is worthless and that I should just end it all. I don’t know what’s happening, but I’m scared."
3382,i dont know if this is normal,"i dont feel attraction to anyone anymore and everyone i meet just wants to fuck me. i literally just want to have friends/people i can trust that i can hang out with. i have none of that, especially because i move all the time as well. i dont really feel enthusiastic about anything as well. when i go to work, i dream of being at my house. when i have a day off, i get depressed because i have nothing to do. is there going to be an end to this? (not going to kill myself, just getting aggravated) also to put icing on the cake, i have a stalker x boyfriend who's found out the new city i've moved to, so i'm scared to go out alone."
3383,Anyone else done with their life and ready to start over?,I've just given up. I've made a mess of this life beyond repair. Just give me a second go :(
3385,How do people keep their head up with a hard life?,"I'm not going to go into detail about every bad thing that has happened to me. We all go through shit on varying degrees but people close to me have mentioned my entire life sounds like a nightmare.  It's one of those things where they don't know how they would react because it's not a situation they like to play around with in their heads.   
So there's really not much advice on how I'm doing mentally despite it all.       
But I do know this.   
I'm sure millions of people have been through similar or worse things and have kept a smile on their face. Have stayed positive at least for others around them.   
I just can't. What is wrong with me? My depression is a burden on others. Since I can't force myself otherwise I've become isolated.  They tell me seeing what my life is like is depressing to them and they'd just rather not even know it exists. It fucks with their head as they know it could happen to them too.               
Even if I could force a smile on my face, I can't control what my body does (health issues).       
I just see life as a big cruel joke. I had a taste of freedom and calmness in my life for a few years and it really is like night and day comparatively. And I know I may never get that back.       
I just sit here watching everyone run in circles around me busy with their lives. Busy busy busy. To distract themselves from the inevitable that I am forced to face on a daily basis.   
No meds have worked for me. Some have put me in the ER and have made me feel a terror I can't describe.  
Therapists have no good answers for me. They have told me how to fake my way through life. But not how to truly feel comfortable with my situation."
3386,nothing to live for,sleep eat repeat
3387,I want to be/feel invisible.,"I’m at an all time low. I’m a woman. A mother. I’m thankful for my supportive boyfriend. But I don’t feel good about myself, at all. 

I barely want to leave the house. If we do leave, I automatically get anxious. If we’re in crowds of people, I’m screaming on the inside. If I see someone I know or recognize, I go the other way hoping they didn’t see me. 

I want to feel like nobody recognizes me. I want to change my appearance so badly that I can walk around my hometown and know that nobody will be able to tell who I am. I want to look brand new, or at the least, be in a new town where I’m a stranger to everyone and everyone’s a stranger to me. 

My boyfriend and son are the only people I feel comfortable around. But even still, I barely feel comfortable with myself. With who I am. I struggle with depression but I’m also struggling with confidence and with my self image. I don’t know what I look like to other people and I’m constantly thinking about that though whenever I’m around people. 

It’s like, i have this image in my head of what I want to look like and how I want other people to view me, and I never live up to that person. I feel like I’m trapped in a body that doesn’t match my soul. Because of this, I’d rather be invisible. Id rather not be around people. I’d rather be a stranger to everyone."
3388,I dreamt that I was dead and i was so happy,"I was so happy all the stress was gone

all the sadness was gone

I felt like I was alright I was the happiness I ever was

then I woke up and realized it was not real 

All the sadness came back 

I felt like nothing will ever get better

I started crying until I could sleep again

Im just waiting to die, I won't kill myself

But I would rather be dead"
3389,The simple target of the family,"Two problems that i suffer. My dad and my sister. Ill start with my dad. When i was in 4,5, and 7th grade, my dad forced me into boxing with my brother. 5x a week i would have to go. I hated it but had to go. Y you may ask “to learn to defend yourself” there are classes exactly for that. Its just that he likes boxing. Ok fine you did something you thought was good for me. I got grounded a couple times because i would even speak out against it but fine. Then my mom puts me into an lapd cadet program. I like it and try to sign up for every possible event. Ig my dad noticed i liked it so now he said you can only go once a week. Wtf i am supposed to go 2x for meetings so i cant sign up for anything. You are saying, if i hate something i HAVE to go 5x a week but if i like it i cant even go 3x a week. Or even 2x. In truth i recently realized why i like the program. Because i am not home. I hate being home. This ties on to the second problem. My sister. Anything and everything i do gets me yelled at. She screams at me rudely for everything. If its not me getting yelled at its that hum of disapproval. I hate it. I wake up and walk to the kitchen. “Jesus bla bla bla bla!!!!!” The phycological torture i deal with of getting yelled at for everything. Not even the military is as bad they get screamed at for doing something wrong but not for everything. And most of the time they are not singled out unless they are really doing something wrong. To make matters worse, any thing i say/do to her gets me in trouble and my whole family defends her. “She is like that” well she can change if you assholes do something. I am the youngest and have no word in anything. I ask my mom something “No” my sister will scream instantly at anything. I am only 13 and i cannot survive another 5 years of this. Ik i have everything i could want. But goddamn i am getting physiologically abused."
3390,An interesting title...,"It sounds terrible, but if I had no people around me to traumatize, I wouldn't doubt and commit suicide. Imagining them thinking about me as a dead is painful, they don't think I have any problems in me life, I can't tell them so I'm hiding that.
Therapy doesn't help, and I'm not even interested in the treatment... It's like you have AIDS, the disease that makes you unable to treat anything"
3391,Does anyone else visualize killing themselves?,"I find myself constantly picturing what it would be like to shove a sword through my stomach or jump off a building. Sometimes in the kitchen I’ll take our biggest, sharpest knife and put the blade on my chest, and just imagine plunging it through. At different points throughout the day I put my hand to my head in the shape of a gun and pull the imaginary trigger. Does anyone else visualize or pretend like they’re killing themselves?
PS: I’m not in a crisis nor do I intend on following through with any suicide ideation."
3392,"I want help, but I secretly feel like I deserve this","I feel terrible all the time and I know that the only way I'm going to feel better is to seek help. The problem is that everytime I think about talking to someone, a voice in my head says ""you deserve to feel like this. You're a god awful person"". It's a sick satisfaction that comes from doing penance. But I also feel that I'm meant to suffer for my entire life. Like the debt is never paid.

It's dumb and irrational but I can't help it. It's been 10 years of this and I feel like my future is empty. I'll be a good worker bee until I likely succumb to a moment of weakness and die by my own hand.

I'm so dang tired."
3393,"my step dad has been an asshole for years and I don't know what do about it anymore, what do I do?","I'm 24. I don't live here with my mom and step dad anymore. I live in another state and am trying to do things up there after college. Anyways, I'm an only child, and my mom married this guy when I was 12. Never liked him. Went through another divorce case at 13 to go live with my dad. That is still traumatic to this day, it's just a huge scar.

This guy is such a worthless human being. His comments and tone set me on fire, I've never heard someone speak like he does. I just got surgery today on my wisdom teeth and I'm back home at their place for about 3 weeks, maybe longer. Anyways I always ignore him as much as I can, don't leave my room to even grab water sometimes, or food.

I'm rambling, but tonight my mom and I were talking about my grandpa, her dad, that just passed a month ago. She was talking about this shirt that she got him for Christmas. She was joking and said he probably burned it because he joking hated it, she didn't find the shirt after cleaning out his house. Then my step dad, who ALWAYS makes fucking comments when my Mom I are talking on the couch and he's just sitting in his chair on his fucking ipad playing this stupid game 12 hours a day goes ""he should of burned the cat too while he was at it"". then my mom said ""Oh my gosh, stop, don't say that"". Then he says, ""I don't care. I'm being serious, she's terrible, he should have burned her too"". Then my mom goes stop talking that way, and i butt in after I'm high as a kite from my wisdom teeth surgery and say that's fucked up, why would you say that? He then again says ""I don't care, she's a terrible cat"". My mom and I probably told him 5 times to stop saying that, and he wouldn't stop, it fucking hurt thinking about him basically getting pleasure from our cat burning to death.

He's a sick worthless fuck. His comment history is just piled with fucked up comments, I promise you it's a fucking million more things than just this incident. He's been fucked up at 2 funerals now, and every day, almost every fucking conversation I try to have, he;s fucking butting being a fucked up smartass! It's unreal! Back to the conversation, my mom said anyways moving on, I guess my dad got rid of the shirt because I couldn't find it, oh well. Then my step dad ended the conversation again saying ""yeah well he also forgot to burn the cat"". I know what he'd say if we started to yell, he'd say y'all are so sensitive and I'm just kidding. Jeez get over it. Mother fucker then why did you say Im serious and that you don't care?? Then, when we changed the subject, why'd you go back to it? I don't deal with shit like that, especially when my mom I are still struggling with my grandpas passing which he reluctantly helped out for because he just tries to look good in front of my mom's family. Behind closed doors he's a monster. I try my fucking hardest to not hate anyone, but I can't help that out of everyone I have met in my life, I truly hate him, and cannot wait for the day he dies. The trauma from 12 to 24 will never leave me. I will never be at his fucking funeral.

I'm starting to lose it now as I've grown from a kid to an adult. I've been so close to hitting him or just slapping him hard as hell, but that would just cause a lot of drama. It's like no matter what I do or day, or what my mom says, he just won't shut up. He's constantly trying to be right even when's he dead fucking wrong, it's amazing. Such a piece of shit. I wish I could type more but this is getting long. Thank you so much if you've read this. I just wanna ask y'all.. I'm lost, and I don't know what to do anymore, I tell my mom that he hurts my feelings and makes me uncomfortable all the time, especially when she's out of the house, and she always says she's gonna say something or do something, but she's a broken record on this. They'll never get divorced, I've pretty much accepted that. Some days I really, really do feel like raising hell, maybe I will. He just needs to shut the fuck up. It;s been 12 years now and he just won't change, ever. After being talked to so many times, he just goes right back to his fucked up ways. God I can't wait til the day he dies. It will be such a fucking relief. So.. what do I do? Going to the police seems extreme, but a possibility, I've told some of my family members and they just don't do anything about it because ""they're not married to him"" or it's not their problem. I've screamed at him before several times, and he usually just freezes up but then later goes back to his ways. Plus it makes the house extremely fucking awkward and my mom just doesn't do much about it. It feels so fucking hopeless. Do I raise hell? Should I raise my voice more? Should I slap him, throw something at him? Screaming into my mom for 12 years has gotten this nowhere. I'm too fucking nice sometimes. I can't fucking take it anymore, I am going to fucking snap. WHAT DO I DO?"
3394,I miss my old self,I've spend my whole day in my bed sleeping and crying. Sometimes I don't even know why I cry. I feel like even doing my favourite things takes me a lot of energy and sometimes I just can't do it. So I stay in bed all day and feel empty. Like nothing is worth it and like I'm broken.  I wish I could go back in time to when I was happy. And I just feel like seeking for attention by writing this post...
3395,Finally Lost The Will To Happy Face,"Pretty much the title. I put on a happy face and make others around me happy. I tell jokes and bake for people, I give all I can in relationships and don’t want anything in return. I cannot see the point to my own life. 

I’d never commit suicide. I lost a cousin when I was younger to suicide and saw what it did to my family. I’d never cause that pain even for a day. As another redditor pointed out recently — “I can die later.” And I can. Going through the motions until I die is a life I’ve accepted. 

I’ve always been able to find a distraction that works for a while. Nothing that actually brings me joy or peace, but just something to do until I die. I haven’t been able to find one in over a year. 

Those closest to me have always focused on how great I am with people and how easily I can brighten someone’s day, but all of that comes from me just trying to do what I’d want someone to do for me, but even I don’t want that, if that makes sense? 

The happy face and joy I bring to others is what people admire most about me, and it’s all built on my own debilitating depression. I’ll talk with others about their struggles with depression and seem to genuinely help them shift gears, so to speak, but can never do that for myself.

I self medicated for a long time but that’s stopped, and I just don’t want to do anything like that anymore. I don’t want to go on pills that seem to cause more harm than good. I’m so utterly depressed that a glass of liquor will sit on my counter for weeks at a time before I pour it down the drain.

I browse reddit and sleep whenever I’m not working. My dreams are an escape, and that’s it. I cannot remember the last time I genuinely smiled. I’m just tired. 

I don’t know what I expect to get by posting this, but it seemed a good a place as any to type out my thoughts. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope that you can avoid the way I feel. I hope your day today has a genuine smile in it, a distraction you can use to get away from this world, or someone to embrace you and love you for the true you — depressed or not."
3396,Anyone feel like sharing some love?,Feeling completely fucked today. So dark. So sad. I just need a sense of community and understanding. Looking for comforting words from people who understand what it’s like to live with depression. ❤️
3397,Video games help!,
3398,I’m exhausted of feeling soo FAKE,"I hate this sosososo much 

I’m constantly smiling and putting out emotions that I don’t feel. Even if I do feel them it’s only for a sec. constant headaches I just want curl up  and sleep. I look forward to night just so I can sleep without anyone questioning it. I hate when I wake up. I just want to be free. I just.... I don’t even know 

I’m forced to live in this world, I hope it treats me better"
3399,I dont know,"Most of the time I dont even know what I feel. I don’t always necessarily feel terrible, but I am almost never _happy_ either"
3400,Friends,"So life at home is hard sometimes and when it gets really hard, I talk to my close friend abt it. Lately my close friend has been distant. We haven't talked for a while. She's been my close friend since 3rd grade.  I don't want to lose her but there's not a lot I can do because my dad is really strict. Our mutual friend and I have been getting to know each other and been getting a bit closer. My close friend of mad at or mutual friend for talking to me a lot. I don't understand what I did wrong. Life at home has been more hellish lately and I want to go hangout at a friend's house to hangout, have fun and just recollect. I can't go hangout at my mutual friends house because my dad is strict and all my friends from school are guys so that's an automatic no. My close friend has texted me back in almost a week. My mutual friend and my close friend got into a fight about it yesterday because our mutual caught feelings for me. Feelings not reciprocated. I'm not sure how, I was just being kind. I don't understand where I went wrong. I don't have a lot of friends and I don't mind cause quality over quantity."
3401,I don’t know what to do,"Im not quite sure what exactly is wrong with me currently. I literally feel nothing anymore... I struggle very hard with trying to express my emotions and trying to just understand how myself I am feeling. Im always in a numb state of mind and I’ve dealt with it for so long that it’s just normal to me now. To just ignore my problems to push away the pain. I’ve only recently come to the point in my life where I’m t trying to get help but nothing is actually helping. I... I don’t even know what to write, my brain just never seems to be clear, I am never able to focus. (So excuse any errors) But I’ve come to a point in my life where I don’t know what to do like at all. I have a very loving boyfriend who’s takes very good care of me, and I feel horrible because whenever I get sad or upset, I go into a numb state and just can’t seem to do anything to fix it other than ignore it and suffer until it passes. I mentally and physically refuse to accept I am in pain. The one question I hate is “Whats Wrong”... the question haunts me. Whenever it’s asked all I ever say is I don’t know. 

Please excuse me if this is all over the place and unorganized. But honestly I have no proper mind functionality, I go off on tangents often and my apologies once again.  I’ve lost several jobs because I can’t go through the pain of going but can go to stores and so just fine which I don’t get. I want to work, I want to make money, but when I do so I would cry at work and it would be horrid. Im currently unemployed and I live with my parents and don’t get me wrong I love and appreciate everything they do but mentally I feel as if they could not give any f**ks to what would happen to me. I’ve never received any help mentally from them, never a “its gonna be okay” ,  “you’re safe” , “were here for you”. Never even s hug when they see my crying. Just why are you crying, people have it worse. 

Im not sure what I hope to get from posting any of this. But I just want to share my personal struggles with depression. I also deny the fact I have it, I feel as if I’m lying to myself or just trying to give myself an excuse to why I’m such a failure at the moment. I also dropped out of college because going became too difficult to me. I did enjoy college though :/

I just ughh I wish I knew how to properly write and explain my feelings. I’m just so over they place. I’ve recently dealt with the thoughts of passive aggressive suicidal tendencies. I believe that’s what it’s called. Where I no longer want to live but don’t want to die? 
The only emotional support I receive is from my boyfriend (He does an amazing job... but lives across the sea and I still have yet to meet him) I’m to scared to go to my parents. I would think my mother understands the most since she had been through it herself and harmed and tried horrid things.... but no. She give me the most shit for how I am. I was in the hospital for a attempt and she sat with me and just basically told me... “you’re 20 now you really need to stop acting like this and get your shit together”. How do I respond to that I’m already a mess crying and just looking for help.

Im sorry if this post didn’t even make sense, I don’t know how to properly ask for help or explain my situation. 

All I know is Im not okay"
3402,Empty feeling,"Ive always had this feeling deep inside me. That something was missing. Lately I feel alone, quiet and empty inside. I don't know how to say it to others. I got the worst grade in my class for a test and I didn't even flinch at it. My dad yells at me and is basically an asshole. The only person I love with all my heart is my mom. I want to get better for her. But I can't help and feel so shallow inside. I want to bring success. I want to look at the things I have and be satisfied with it. I want to look at myself and be satisfied with who I am. But I feel that will never happen. I don't know what will fill the emptiness, inside of me.  I don't know if it's just a matter of getting away and starting new somewhere else. I just hope at some point this neverending cycle stops. I might not be the best person in the world, but i hope I can be the best for my mom and myself"
3403,Is it normal to be violent with depression?,Hi I'm an 18 year old male and I've been depressed my whole life sometimes when I'm angry I get violent it doesn't matter who it is it could be my mum dad sisters dogs a random person it doesn't matter. Yesterday I had a bit of a break down and I ended up hitting my dad a few times and punched 3 holes in a walls this has been common for me to react this way my whole life. in July 2016 I nearly beat my sister to death she had a giant bump on her head the size of a tennis ball  I've also given my dad a black eye 2 separate times I push my mum around and call her names but when I'm by myself I just cry because I don't wanna be alive anymore just wondering does depression make people violent or am I just a bad person?
3404,I don’t know if it’s going to get better - will it?,Sometimes I feel ok but other times I feel like shit and hate myself. I have been like this for a long time. There’s so much on my mind. Can anyone please give me some hope.
3405,I notice my old friends actually care about me and miss me.,"I still don't know if it's out of kindness or not, but I like to see that they miss me."
3406,I need some advice on California Rocket Fuel.,"To start, i've been depressed for a few years. Caffeine never did anything for me even as a kid, and 5-hour energy used to work great right before the depression symptoms. I'm always sorta tired and nothing gives me energy.

I was previously prescribed Venlafaxine, but stopped taking it because I was always more groggy than usual for most of the day after taking it, plus it made orgasming impossible. I've recently been put on Mirtazapine and haven't noticed much of a change from my normal tiredness. Would combining it with my Venlafaxine have a better chance of working better for me, or would it most likely just increase my lethargy? Also, what are the chances of contracting serotonin syndrome?"
3407,should i admit myself at the psychiatric hospital? tw suicide,"i don't know if my mental health is bad enough for this, but i've been awful these past few months. i would just feel really silly if i packed a bunch of stuff, got an evaluation, and was sent home because i'm fine. i took wellbutrin, but it made me manic and actively suicidal, and that was when i first started to consider voluntary commitment. wellbutrin also triggered my disordered eating and ocd symptoms, especially intrusive thoughts about suicide and death.

i still have images of me self harming and attempting suicide, but they don't really stress me out anymore like they did just a few weeks ago. they are kind of soothing. also, i'm not sure if i'm actively suicidal or not because i've been dissociating pretty bad this past month as well, so i just don't know what i want. when i took wellbutrin, my plan was to overdose on xanax and alcohol because i have access to both, and now i can't stop thinking about it. i don't know if that means anything because i don't know if that's an actual plan or not, but that's how i would do it, like i could do it right now if i really wanted to.

i've been wanting to go ever since i started taking wellbutrin, but i was always afraid until my friend got admitted involuntarily a few days ago and told me he likes it. i don't know if i'm bad enough to get that kind of help though, but i kind of feel afraid of myself. also i only get to see my therapist twice this month, and my psychiatrist appointment is on thursday, but i can't wait until thursday to get help, and i need a lot of help right now. i don't feel well at all. i'm only taking a mood stabilizer now, but i upped my dose, so now i'm sleeping all day long and feel more depressed, but i still feel like i have the energy to do something to hurt myself"
3408,Trapped.,"Utterly trapped. This isn't how I imagined life.

**I've seriously considered disappearing.** Just get enough experience in a job to move on somewhere else where I can live and work in peace. Show people **the real me**, rather than who people presume I am, or what they prefer me to be.

Would people be sad that I'm gone...maybe...but it's not like they visit me, or contact me, only if I am to be of use in a situation. I'm convenient. Would I feel bad for putting them through the not knowing? Obviously. But at least I'd be happier.

It's not a situation where I can just move to another state, I would always be required to visit...often. Family are oddly co-dependent.

I just pictured life VERY differently. **I just want a normal life.** It just doesn't feel right and I'm just going on autopilot all the time."

3410,My friend read my journal,"I’m having a really bad panic attack right now because my friend read my private journal. She said she didn’t mean to,but she kept reading. I didn’t mean to leave it open, I panicked and i told her to leave what is wrong with me"
3411,I'm a fuck-up,"Why i am always the bad guy. When i do something its always bad and my fault, and i dont understand why. Maybe i dont see how i act sometimes:/ 
My mom just come in my room and started yelling at me.....like what did i do wrong???
(She was on her phone [whit a guy] and i started talking to her and she didn't listened to me at all she just smiled [but not like she wanted to talk to me more like she wanted me to get the fuck away from her] so i said ""you're not even paying any attention to me"" [like fucking never, and when i wanna talk she is on her phone for hours]  and i went in my room. And when she finished her convo she came into my room and yelled . I started crying... she said i could say to her to put her phone down and we could talk but what i want to say is just 5 sec, it doesn't make sense to me...then i said why would i do it differently when  it worked?? * (i mean she came to talk to me, not in a way i would like to but this is still a step foward[yeah my family is fucked up])*and i know she was right but i am really stubborn and i didn't wanted her to feel good about herself becouse it's not just my fault
Then she asked me why i am mean to her ""have i ever hurted you??"" (Bitch don't say that to me you never did --only thinking this) then i started saying the times she did hurt me:/ 

And i only writeing this to this subreddit becouse i am scared that the slightest problem will send me back to being sad for years again ( i was sad for a really long time and i know what it is like and i dont want to be there angain. Somehow I--&gt; IIII[and i am happy i could do this alone]managed to pull myself from there and i didnt feel like this for a long time but when i am starting to feel it coming back and when i star to feel unmotivated and sad i start to write to this sub becouse it helps to let my feelings out sometimes.

So if noene will see this i still want to see thank you to this sub becouse without it i would be nowhere...

But if you see this i hope you have an amazing day, week, month even year(yeah i know the year one is too much,and the month one is little bit over the top but i hope that one day all of us gonna have a good month(or year) and thank you for reading it

Love you guys"
3412,I’m tired of teenagers faking depression,"I’m not depressed, and I hope I never will be because I know it’s fucking miserable. And it irks me that teens think that being depressed is “cool” now."
3413,Dysthymia is a slow burn. This makes me feel like I'm quickly burning alive.,"I've gone through this shit for years. I was finally diagnosed with dysthymia three or four years ago. Every month I seem to have 1-2 week periods where it just becomes totally unbearable. Instead of life being a huge drag, it becomes pure torture. I become so, so angry at myself. I can't sleep; I may manage to doze off at 10 or 11 and wake up at 12:30, and then I can't sleep for hours. I feel completely numb when I'm not angry, especially when I wake up. I desperately want to self-sabatoge so I can ""justify"" the way that I feel. I have *horrible* thoughts about myself. 


I felt this inevitable wave coming last Saturday or Sunday, and it's been getting worse as the week has dragged on. Every second is torture. I know it will go back to regular dysthymia in a few more days, but it feels so damn hopeless. I'm so tired of dealing with this shit. 


My closest friends can't believe I'm depressed. I function quite well. I can still force myself to do things when I'm in this state, even though it feels so, so much harder and pointless. I wish I could help them understand. Even I feel like I'm faking it much of the time, though. And what's the point of sharing it with them? It's just going to bring them down."
3414,None of this is real.,"It can't be. Surely I died and went to hell, or perhaps sent myself into a drunken haze and forgot my name. I'd much rather believe my very existence is a futile, meaningless project. Maybe it's all a long dream. I know it seems obscure and dramatic, but no more. I hate this feeling, I want it gone. I have nothing left to loose so why not try? Maybe killing myself would wake me up. 

Can you imagine that? My solution this entire time was the thing everyone said was wrong. This entire time the whole ""suicide is not the answer"" thing was just a saying so they wouldn't all fade from existence. All the people who hurt me were just lies. 

It's a nice thought, the irony is almost funny. A loud BOOM and I'd wake up. It'd be a blurry sunday with a steady and timid sky, the moons shining remains melting unto what's left of night. I would have a group of friends waiting for me outside and a happy, stable family. I'd have a passion or goal and my pals would throw shit at me for it jokingly. Yeah, lol they would likely give me shit for how low my grades would be, but nonetheless they'd be there. Everything would be simple, the tough times ahead would be a shit load easier. Then again, I'd mess it up somehow."
3415,Weird emotions at weird times,"So today my boyfriend and I went to see the second Jumanji movie and we thoroughly enjoyed it...

But there was one line that got me sobbing to the point where I had a panic attack.

Not really a spoiler but an actor says ""It's a gift to grow old.""

My dad was 64 when he passed away. This year on the 6th of December he would have been 69. I feel like we were owed a lot more time together.

I'm not sure if it's just me being overly emotional because it's that time of year...."
3416,I am at an all time low,"I’m sorry if this sounds really whiny, I’m at the lowest low of my life right now. I’m 20yo and everything in my life is deteriorating, my health both mentally and physically are at rock bottom. I’m failing this semester, I’m broke and I have no friends. I’m the definition of a mess. I guess I’m just extremely overwhelmed I don’t even know where to begin, it’s driving me insane. Even with all this happening I haven’t completely lost hope but I just don’t have the motivation anymore even though I really want to change things, I want to be better version of myself so badly. I don’t need to get old to start crippling because this illness has already done that job."
3417,Anyone else feel this way?,Anyone else feel that they are just destined for a life of misery? Like whenever anything good comes its either temporary or taken away and you are left feeling worse than before. I feel like that most days...
3418,"Been on Lexapro for a month, here’s my experience.","I used to post here pretty regularly, as I was suffering pretty badly from severe depression and anxiety. Over the past month or so, I decided to try and seriously work on my mental health &amp; I do feel I’ve made some progress. I moved back home (closer to my girlfriend and family), I withdrew from last semester at the University I was attending, and I’ve been on Lexapro for approx 6-7 weeks. 

Below I’ll list what I’ve experienced with the medicine so anyone who may be prescribed it will know what to expect.

***Positives***
-	Anxiety has been severely diminished
-	Overall sense of calmness (especially right after taking the medicine)
-	Depressive episodes have reduced greatly (used to be an everyday thing, I’ve been probably 2-3 weeks without one)
-	I actually have motivation to do basic things (and sometimes I actually find myself doing some of the stuff I used to really enjoy).

***Negatives***
-	Lexapro can cause insomnia if taken late at night
-	Lexapro can also cause reduced sex drive &amp; the inability to ejaculate
-	If you don’t take the medicine for more than 2 days, you will quickly become irritable and agitated

***Tips***
-	Take your Lexapro as soon as you wake up, the medicine will be in your system by time you go to bed, which will help reduce the insomnia effect.
-	If you are still unable to sleep, you can take melatonin to help regulate your sleep schedule (ONLY TAKE THE PRESCRIBED DOSE).
-	As for the reduced sex drive &amp; inability to ejaculate, there isn’t much you can do to fight these symptoms. If you masturbate heavily, reducing the frequency you do so could be incredibly beneficial. Once your genitalia become desensitized due to excessive masturbation, combined with the affects of Lexapro, you may even find it impossible to keep an erection. The best tip for this is to just completely abstain from masturbation &amp; only seek out sexual pleasure with a significant other.
-	You may get an upset stomach when first getting on Lexapro; however, as time passes, your body will get used to it and you will have less problems.


Remember, not everyone is the same. Some of you may not have any of these issues, and some of you may have more than what was listed. My advice is to find what works for you. For me, I was lucky that the Lexapro actually has been extremely helpful. For you, a different medicine may work to your advantage. While the negatives of SSRI’s are something we all must deal with (if you choose to follow a medication route), and typically the side affects are worth the peace of mind that the medicine will bring."
3419,Why does life have to be so hard and complicated?,"I (22F) just graduated from a top university program with the highest honours. All my life, I  have been a great student, excelling everyone's expectations. Everyone around be, parents, relatives and teachers, thought I would be a doctor. When everyone in your life tells you ever since you were a child about what you should do, you start believing it and pursuing it and defining your identity around it. That is what I did. 

But in my final years of college, I started have doubts, questioning everything I was doing. I didn't feel happy in any of my classes and was just doing things other pre-med students were doing, half-heartedly and purpose-lessly. I was depressed, not taking care of myself, spending days in bed with no motivation. But no one knew cuz I didn't want them to know. I am good at faking it and keeping my emotions bottled. So I did what was expected, in my final year before graduation, I applied to medical school thinking I have come this far and this is what is expected of me. I didn't get in and after that, my depression has worsened. 

I didn't attend my own graduation even though I had one of th highest GPAs in my class. I was ashamed, not because I didnt get into medical school when everyone else did, but because I was at a point in my life where I didn't know who I was and who I wanted to be. I am constantly surrounded by those who know where they are going and at least have a plan. For me, when all my life I have worked toward becoming one thing and now I am realizing that one thing isn't for me,I FEEL LOST, HOPELESS, like a failure, DEJECTED, not good enough and the list goes on.

Now, my parents keep asking that I should apply to med again but I know in my heart that is not what I want in my life. It has been a while since I have been feeling it but only recently I came to terms with it. My parents aren't the forcing type but they want answers about what I want to do if not med. And I DON'T have those answers. I don't know anymore. I am not motivated to do anything. Even my own family doctor expected me to be a doctor lol so I have disappointed her too and I cant even talk to her about my depression because I know first thing she would ask me when I go to her is why I am not applying again and try to convince me to apply again. It sucks when you don't feel a safe space with your own doctor cuz she says what my parents say. 

I am only 22 but my parents think I am getting old and need to get my life together, settle down. And at this point, I don't even think life is worth living when all I have done so far is disappoint everyone around me and will continue to disappoint as I don't know where to go next. I just need a reason to live and to go one because everyday its hard to get myself up and do things. I want to live a fulfilling life, do something that makes me happy, but right now, I just need a will to live and to move forward and I don't have any of that.

If you have gotten this far, thank you for reading. I just needed to let this stuff out."
3420,I am not good enough,"Not good enough for my family. For relationships. For grad school for my work. For my friends. For myself. 

I am a hard worker. Smart. Loving and genuine. But that’s not enough. I get used by people for my skills but then get tossed aside like an empty water bottle. I don’t want to live like this. I don’t feel like I’m worth anything. Like no one will ever appreciate and want me."
3421,Could this be described as depression?,"I used to be a very anxious and empathetic person. That all changed. I now feel completely emotionally numb, I’m not happy, I’m not sad, I never feel emotional ups or downs. I’m completely empty inside. I don’t cry, feel emotional pain, any sort of joy or elation about anything. It completely changed me. I thought my crippling anxiety and fear was holding me back, I had no idea being numb would be so much worse. I refuse to go to the doctor about it, because they aren’t able to figure out what’s wrong at all after several visits. The American health system is also broken and if u are depressed in America you loose rights and become a second class citizen."
3422,Guys i honestly don't know why i should stay sober,"I just drank a bottle of vodka , smoked some weed &amp; ate magic truffles

Right now i feel better then i could ever feel when sober.

I recently had this thought that , a lot of the time sober people feel like shit more then half of the time , right ?

But when you use drugs , when you're on drugs you usually feel great. And when you're on drugs you 're on drugs more then half of the time. (if you're a junkie) So aren't you happier then sober people? Okay , maybe we'll die younger but i guess at least we'll have enjoyed something.

I'm still doing what i need to do. But in the weekend i really need to get fucked up to escape everything for a moment.

The thing that maybe isn't that good is that i smoked my first couple of cigarettes in a couple of months. Why i did is that i don't want to live until i'm 80. If i feel happy and fulfilled with my life , or in other words ""don't feel fucked up in my head"" , i'll quit. But right now i see little or no reason to fully quit. Life sucks but we've got to keep swimming or we'll drown. I'm swimming but i need something to escape. A little fucking break. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else get what i'm saying or am i just rambling like a drunken idiot ? Which is entirely possible. 

Good evening/"

3426,My life feels off completely,"I'm 13 years old and my life feels off completely. All of my friends are gone, people constantly pick on me and it feels like I have nobody. I've committed self harm by cutting and I don't know what to do with myself. Most days I feel like giving up. I have nobody and I feel alone. Please help me"
3427,Does it ever go away?,"I feel myself slipping back into the my worst state of depression since 2014. 

I've worked so hard on myself and my mental health but this year has been a fucked up amalgamation of misery and regret. 

I don't know what to do. I really don't. My physical health is also getting worse and worse, I don't have the financial means to go to a psychologist, something I should have done years ago. 

I am going through a great deal right now and it has seemingly escalated in the last few months. I just desperately want to not revisit that period of time in my life but it feels like I'm heading there and doing so quickly. 

I'm fucking miserable, I am physically exhausted and emotionally deflated. 

Does it get better...

I don't even know why I'm asking this."
3428,Need advice with medicine,"Hey guys one of my first posts here but I have depression and anxiety. Anyways I’ve tried ssris(Prozac)for awhile back in September and it made me feel like I was tripping lsd but only a bad trip, but I’ve recently started counseling but the only thing that helps the anxiety is self medicating like prescription opioids or alcohol, weed used to help but now it just makes the anxiety worse. Now I’m scared that if I continue self medicating I’ll develop an addiction but I can’t even get my class work done bc I can’t focus from the anxiety racing my thoughts. How would I explain this to a doctor in hopes to finding a medication that would ease my anxiety, but allow me to get shit done (I have a massive tolerance to most drugs as is) also what kind of doctor should I go to as Im sure my pediatrician (I’m 20yrs) who I had been going to will only write me hydroxyzine which used to work but I built a tolerance to it so it’s kind of useless to me. Any recommendations?"
3429,The smallest things ruin my day,"Do you ever feel like the smallest annoyance drives you astray and ruins your whole day? Like my parents want to take me out, then I feel despaired and low mood for some reason, then I say no, then I feel guilty, then I close my bedroom door and lie and face the ceiling, then I scrap my plans to date, then I feel like the world is closing in, and that I’ll be stuck in this hole forever.

I want to feel better and not like this anymore. I’m really sick and tired."
3430,"I'm willing to admit that maybe I'm not doing ok, but that's ok","Background, i'm 26 and working my first full time job. I did the whole 4 years of college and dove straight into 3 years of law school, and just graduated this past summer.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 4 years now, i've struggled with self-doubt and self-loathing at a level that I've never truly experienced before. Lots of it was impostor syndrome while I was in law school, lots of it was years of negative self-talk finally coming to a breaking point. These past few years i've flirted with the idea of self-harm, though thankfully I never took it to the next step.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i've graduated, failed the bar, just submitted my application to take it again in February. The shitty thing is I'm not sure if i'm taking it because I actually want to be a lawyer, or if it's a sense of obligation. Of course if I talk to my law school peers or people from work, they tell me I need to retake it and i'll ""be fine"" and that they're ""sure I'll pass!"" But I can't help but feel like that's bullshit. I feel like for the past however long, i've been extremely mechanical. Get up, go to point A, then point B, come home, sleep. Rinse, wash, repeat. Not much feels genuine anymore, most things feel like i'm doing them out of obligation or what is expected of a ""functioning"" adult.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i've come up with the perfect analogy. I feel like i'm a hamster on a hamster wheel going full throttle, but I'm not going anywhere. Part of me doesn't want to stay on the wheel, but at this point i've gone for so long and am going so fast that I'm terrified to get off. I'm gonna be honest with y'all. I'm tired, and i'm scared.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's ok! the first step to recovery is admitting there's a problem right? I need to wait for my insurance to kick in but new year resolution is to at least take conscious steps towards working towards better mental health. 5th year's the charm right?"
3431,Coming to terms with Death itself,"This isn't a prelude to a self-harming post as a foreword, but I would seriously appreciate any input on the topic as everyone who has been born in the history of humanity across its' span of tens of thousands of years has died, or is going to die eventually.

I was just thinking about life as a whole - instead of sleeping. It kept me up thinking it over how some people have argued before that death is similar to life before we were born. Not withstanding the religious divergence regarding re-incarnation, heaven/hell, or whatever else may be - I disagree with the philosophy that death will be like what it was before we were born (I.e. Billions of years passed before you were born and you weren't conscious, so it will be the same when you die).

I believe that 'Nothing --&gt; Something' is *not* the same as 'Something --&gt; Nothing'. Before we are born, we cannot comprehend life or death, they do not exist as we do not exist. When we are alive we have the capacity to know what life is and recognise what the absence of it is. That being, a permanent loss of awareness, consciousness, or the capacity to experience the world around us. ('Oh it will be like falling asleep and not waking up' I dislike the falling asleep forever comparison)

I cannot stop it. Everyone who has ever lived has died - or is dying. If there was any means by which someone from beyond could show us there is something beyond death, billions of people who have lived and died have failed to show us how. For this reason and others, I do not think there is anything after death. As much as I want I cannot stop it from happening. I want to fight it but I know it is futile to try."
3432,Failing out of college a second time,"I just don't know what to do anymore. Last year, my junior year, I failed out of college due to severe depression and anxiety. It was the first time in my life where I experienced severe depression and anxiety attacks and it was scary. I was dismissed from the school and spent a year working and trying to get back into university, which I did.

Now this semester is coming to a close and I am guaranteed to fail out again. I feel the anxiety attacks creeping up on me even as I type this. For the last month I've felt this coming, and can't stop thinking about how much of failure I am and how much of my parents' money I've thrown away. The guilt is unbearable. My family and girlfriend are supportive but I've barely told them the extent of the situation, my family still thinks I'm doing ok. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel lost and scared, even empty. I've lost all self confidence, all motivation, and any self worth or passion. 

I hope any of this made sense. I'm just trying to avoid a panic attack."
3433,"Thought I would share my story, because sometimes it helps to talk about things.","I’m a 19 y/o male college student. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder shortly before beginning college. I take Lexapro to deal with my anxiety. My depression is linked to a cascade of things from the recent past. I graduated high school dating a girl I had been with since early in my junior year. 

By the time I started college I found myself breaking down, as I discovered I didn’t like my major and it had gotten too late to change it. I had no idea what I wanted to study or if I even wanted to be in college. At the same time, I was trapped in a relationship with someone who thought she was marrying me. I was guilted into spending 100% of my time with her. After meeting my current girlfriend at college,  I developed a crush on her and realized I needed to get out of my relationship because I was not in love. This ended up being a monthlong struggle of harassment and guilt tripping from my ex. There were multiple times where she falsely lead me to believe she was about to commit suicide. 

This eventually passed, and I started taking interest in this new girl I met at my college. We went on a few dates and had our first kiss within just a few weeks of meeting. I immediately felt a spark. I had never felt so alive in my life. Then she began acting odd, ignoring all of my messages. She later told me she didn’t want a relationship. We still hung out, but as friends. She sent mixed messages by flirting at times and then seeming disinterested. I realized I did not have the 
patience to play games, so I decided I was done talking to her. I ignored her messages. That same day, she called me crying and told me the truth. She was in a relationship with someone who was emotionally abusive, and she had been cheating on him with me. I am normally very against cheating, but I was relieved that it wasn’t that she didn’t like me. I gave her advice on how to get out of her relationship. We then began dating. 

The next few months were great. We were both very happy. We spent a lot of time together traveling and adventuring in our free time. I also had my own freedom to do the things I enjoyed. All of my close highschool friends started their own lives. Moved away for college, started new busy jobs. My best friend of 7 years lost his respect for me for how I had left my ex and moved on so quickly. He no longer talked to me and we argued anytime I tried to contact him. My new girlfriend was really all I had as a friend. I didn’t make any friends at college because honestly I had forgotten how to make new friends. 

I began to become depressed once again because a very close family friend was struggling with cancer. His condition was worsening and I was not prepared for his death. This man was a huge part of my life, like a father. He taught me everything I know today. He passed away shortly after christmas last year. I was devastated. I spent most of my time grieving. It was difficult to find joy in anything. It was the first time I had broken down and cried in front of my girlfriend. She eventually became distant. My grieving lasted months. To make it worse, my girlfriend seemed unhappy. She no longer supported me when I had moments of depression. She just wanted to get away from me. 

Shortly after, her father suddenly disappeared. He abandoned his daughter, son and wife because he was sick of fighting with his wife, right in the middle of selling their house. In his absence, I spent lots of time at their house. For about a month I was the man of the house, making repairs and helping wherever I could. My girlfriend’s mother was very grateful. My girlfriend became depressed from all the stress of her dad leaving. She changed. Barely spoke to me. This further fueled my depression. She rejected any kind of emotional help I could offer. 

I became suspicious. I regret invading her privacy, but I logged into her Mac and discovered she had been lying to me from the beginning. Lied about who she had and hadn’t slept with, lied about who she did and didn’t keep in contact with. She was to move in with me after her parents sold their house. I found messages with an ex boyfriend discussing her relationship struggles with me. I found out she had cheated on me the day before my close friend passed away. She even lied multiple times after being confronted. 

I packed everything I had at her house and drove an hour home after finding all of this out. The happiest times of my life were all a lie. The emotional pain I felt while driving home and ignoring all of her calls was something I would not wish on my worst enemy. I thought of crashing my car. I thought of packing everything I owned, leaving my phone, and disappearing. I told her I was leaving her, and she was devastated. I ultimately decided to stay because I loved her and I was empathetic about her father abandoning her. I was also much too weak to go through a breakup. 

From that point on, she changed. She gave up every connection she had to her past without a doubt. Her father returned after a month and a half, and the house sold. Our relationship healed and she regained my trust. She moved in with me and her parents and brother moved to Florida. 

I still face random episodes of depression. I lose touch with reality and flash back to everything that happened. I still try to get closure for the things she did that I don’t understand. I’m unable to let it all go. At times I am ashamed of myself for being blind to these things. I struggle to find confidence in my appearance and abilities. I find it difficult to be focus on self-care. It puts a strain on my relationship. I am afraid of the hurt that the future might bring."

My family would be sad. My daughter would grow up without her Dad. But... over time they'll move on. Everyone will. And I'll be dead. So it wouldn't even concern me. They know I love them. I just don't see the point.

When they hurt me, I smile. I don't have the mental energy to refute or argue back anymore.

I feel terrible, and lonely. I have people in my life who love me and would cheer me up, but the more I care about them, the less I tell them about how I really feel. I'm scared that telling them will annoy them—even when people say that they'll be there for me, I know I'm being a liability. It does nothing for them to listen to my minor problems and feelings. I just needed to get this off my chest because, as the post suggests, I haven't told anyone this either."
3437,My bestfriend thinks he's depressed and I dont know how to deal with it,"I (M20) have a bestfriend (M20) , we both just recently graduated from college, and recently he's been acting weird, somedays he's really happy and really active when were together, and we would talk about the most random things for hours and just enjoy each others company, and somedays he shuts people out and doesn't even talk to me or anyone else, and when I do try to talk to him via chat he just sends dry replies to end the conversation quickly. 

he's been acting like this for a few weeks now, he also had told me that at times he feels depressed but is not sure if its depression but at times when he does feel this,thats when he stop talking to anyone.He's one of the best, kindest qnd thoughtful people I know and I dont eant him to feel depressed but I dont know what to tell him but I always say that im always here for him and he can always tell me anything because he is like a brother to me. Any advice?"
3438,i have gotten help but nothing is working,"everything is getting worse. my depression, yes, but the anxiety is the worst of it. i feel physically sick because of it. i’ve switched medicine twice. im seeing a psychiatrist. i try my best to make the most out of every day. i try to eat when i dont want to. but it all seems pointless. i am so afraid of death but i don’t want to live anymore. i cant stay the night at friends house anymore because i have panic attacks. i have given up seeking help from friends because i only hear the same thing. “time heals. it will be okay. you can do this. you should look for more help.” none of that seems true and i have sought help. i also don’t want to be a burden to them. all i am is depressed and negative and it drives people away but i cant force myself to be fake anymore. my dad knows about the suicidal thoughts and cutting. i hug him anytime i feel sad. i’m doing everything i can think of but in the end i feel like i have no control. i can’t even control my body. i get random fits out of nowhere now. everything seems so out of my grasp and i just want it to end."
3439,"I feel guilty, stupid and giving up","Everyday when i wake up i just want to fall asleep again because everyday is just the same for me, nothing exciting ever happens. i have no one that can understand me and whenever i try to talk with someone it always ended up being awkward because of my stupid brain and anxiety, i shut myself in my home and i don't want to leave because i always feel guilty and bad whenever i feel like someone is just bad mouthing me which i know is true. i really hate my life and want to end it all, i have so many regrets in the past and present wishing i could go back and change them. i tried multiple suicide attempts but it always ended up as a failure due to my fear in not being able to pull it off. however, one thing that always keeps me going is Drawing, i wanted to become a great digital artist or even an animator so i can share my artwork to everyone but i'm still a beginner at it. I love watching anime as well they keep me distracted from problems with my miserable and useless life, one anime i love is Dr.Stone so i decided to make a fanart of Kohaku from the show but since christmas time is almost here i wanted Kohaku to dress in a christmas themed clothing but when i posted it to a Discord channel and Reddit, i get disgusted response from people like it was a cursed drawing or something, i think they're right tho, it does look cursed. i regret every decision i make in my life. i want to end it all. if only i wasn't such a coward i would have done it a long time ago."
3440,Can’t remember the last time I laughed or smiled. Guess that’s life for ugly 20 year old girls.,
3441,Shame and embarassement that comes with screwups is so hard to get over. /TIFU,"I thought I should post it to r/TIFU but the guilt and shame that came with screwing this one up was beyond anything. 

So I go to university to work on my thesis, and it's weekends. When suddenly my supervisor notices that the lights in my office are turned on so he pops in to check, and finds me working on thesis. So we chat up, and discuss my work, everything went normal but at one point he suggested I make use of this software which whould help him diagnose my work better, so he takes my laptop and proceeds to open browser to download it, and lo and behold all my porn history shows up in the address bar. He pretends to not notice it, and just downloads the software and continues to discuss the  work. 

My heart just dropped at that point, when he opened the address bar. I know I should just wave it off jokingly, but what with my depression, this whole episode just makes me feel ashamed beyond any normal scope. It's like my insides were ripped off.

PS: My supervisor is an amazing fellow, even though he used my laptop with my permission, I know he keep everything superprofessional and friendly. And I think I noticed he tried his best to make me comfortable by delving into different topics."
3442,I Feel Hopeless,"I am not old enough to feel so hopeless. I have very little life experience at 17 and just like most people in my life have told me, I do not have any reason to be depressed. I have nothing to be sad about. My life is great; I have a house, food, water clothes, electronics, books, a car. I have everything I could want but I don't have happiness. I am playing a rigged game. 

I have been diagnosed with depression, or what the therapists and doctors think is depression, since 4th grade. I suffered a facial injury from being hit in the face with a baseball bat. It was an accident with no ill intent. 

My friends at the time, the only ones I had and would be able to have for the next three years of elementary due to our small school, had just started to push me away. They had given up on me before I had even really been going downhill.  The school had given up on me too and they found out I had been self harming so they called my parents and forced me into therapy. My father still sticks by that, even after having self harmed from 4th grade until March of this year, I was doing it for attention because of the way the school called him.  

My friends started joking with me by calling me fat and ugly and I of course joked along because for a while it was funny. Then it wasn't but every time I spoke up they called me a baby and told me they were joking and I let them continue so they would stay around. I have always been a people pleaser. I do what I am expected to and I let people walk all over me continuously because of my hunger for love and acceptance. 

I grew up with an alcoholic father and a split household. My mother met my father one drunken night at a Christmas party and they started dating. They broke up sometime after I was born. I have only ever lived with them both in the same house for a year total. 

My dad is a spiteful man. He was never physically harmful but he knows his way around words. He has been sober for four years and although he was hardly ever sober when I was younger, I miss when he was drunk all the time. He was usually too drunk to say mean things to me because he would pick fights at bars. Now that he is sober, he picks on me instead only because I am around twice a week and it is easy for him. He calls me worthless a lot and I blame the way he treated me as a child for my doormat tendencies. 

I started out being pretty level, I was sad sometimes but it was just sadness and I could handle it even if I had absolutely nobody to fall back into. As I grow up, the black empty space inside of me just grows. There were days where I could handle the void. Now the days bleed into each other. The void can be held back for a while, just long enough for school, but the minute I come home the blackhole swallows me and I end up sleeping all the time because I would rather be asleep than aware of the real world. I feel so much of nothing and too much of everything that I feel like I am freezing and combusting all at once. I feel as though I have forgotten how to breathe. I am sad and I am aware of the sad all the time no matter what I do. 

I feel incredibly hopeless. I am not suicidal because I am afraid of death but I am sad and tired and I feel so beyond alone. 

I'm unsure of why I came to reddit to say all of this but I feel like it might be because I have nobody else to say this to. I have friends and people who would listen but they have heard too many of the sad things I have to say and they're dealing with their own lives. I don't think  it would be fair of me to go to them.

My body feels empty and too full and everything is dreary and dismal. I am tired. Maybe I am tired of living or being me but I don't know."
3443,I still feel terrible,"I found a good job and got a girlfriend for the first time but I don't feel like things are improving for me. Every time I get something I suppose will make me feel better, it doesn't.  I was even preparing myself to be a stepdad and to move  abroad but I suddenly felt like I don't have the energy or interest in that. I don't even take care of myself well enough. Why did i assumed that I could ""be there"" for other people. After feeling loved for the first time I feel like I cant gain anything else from a relationship besides feeling drained and loneliness is hitting again. My job is pretty decent. I work without supervision and do things as I please. My coworkers are nice old people and we are always laughing and slacking off. My Boss is kind and buys us coffee . Why the good things that happen to me don't affect positively how I feel and I always find a way to be miserable?"
3444,I've decided December 27th is my death day,"I'm tired of my failed life and since my dad died on December 27th 1995 it will be a fitting tribute since I'll never be half the man he was. 

 My only consolation will be my kids won't have to grow up knowing how much a failure their father was. 

At least they'll have the good memories I didn't have since dad was always gone working to stay away from my drunk mom."
3445,I don’t want to be me,I don’t like this. This is fucking horrifying. I FUCKING HATE THIS. I WANT TO FUCKING BURN!!!
3446,Why are poeple so selfish,"Why are people so cruel and selfish to me all the time when I'm nice and sweet with them?
Why do they take me for granted?

Is there any Light out there ? Hello"
3447,School sucks,"I used to be a straight A student, attending all classes, keeping up with my studies and you may say, I had it all together, but this year is just like I've completely lost interest in school or in learning in general at school, I still watch educational videos on YouTube about things I'm actually interested in, and as I do that, my grades fall downhill.
I've lost interest in getting out of bed, of even trying to get my life together, mom sees that but she doesn't really care, I'm so tired and I don't know what to do anymore, I just want to die.."
3448,What to Do on the Hard Days?,"Hi all.  When I’m in the lows of my depression, I often wake up and just feel “ugh.”  You know?  And, no matter how hard I try, it feels like the day will be bad no matter what.   Do you all have any ways to combat this?  Thank you, and try to have a good day."
3449,Going back to the psych ward ^_^,"yesterday was a long day, woke up absolutely shit because of a good dream, basically i got attached to someone who isnt even real and was mourning them.

 Yesterday i had multiple breakdowns, did a big deep cut across my forearm and another on my thigh, headbanging, just going around and using anything to self harm, then i ODed on sleeping pills last night, woke up 17 hours later in a pook of my vomit. Just puked up half of it, good thing i slept on my side :p

Anyway, i went to the hospital earlier, got my fix, stitches and shit. Got my stomach checked and they tried to hospitalize me but i bullshitted my way out.

Now, i dont wanna stay here, im not safe in my own presence, i’m going back to get hospitalized. 

Not my first rodeo, psych wards really arent that bad, just kinda boring, but i did find a lot of like-minded folks, screaming blokes and mellow fellows. 

I hope you guys seek help in a crisis, if you dont feel like youre safe if youre on your own, then you’re probably right. Look out for yourselves, Can’t be too careful :)"
3450,I hate my life and suicide seems like the only solution,"I’ve been abandoned, cheated on, mistreated, humiliated, beaten up, stepped over, etc...so I consider myself a strong person. But in July I fell into my third depression and I have never hated  myself so much. I’m a student, my exams are on January, I have a book that I wanted to publish but I don’t have the strength to finish it and I can’t study which is the worst considering the money parents are spending. Most of my friends have proven to be fucking fake and even if I wasn’t alone (which I am), I wouldn’t have the strength to go anywhere to meet them. 

Every day feels the same (because it is) and I want to change it but I have no strength. I’m in so much medication and just the thought of leaving my bed and do absolutely anything seems impossible. Exams are next month and I feel like such a disappointment because my parents are spending so much money and I just cannot study. My psychologist (who is amazing)  keeps telling me that my life is more important (I’ve tried to commit suicide twice, without even thinking of leaving a note because I’m fucking selfish), keeps trying to convince me that my life is more important, but I don’t feel that way. I feel worthless. I want to kill my self but I don’t know how (I’ve already tried cutting my arms but it doesn’t work) and I’m just so tired. Every day is so long and boring and even if I studied I would still be home and I don’t have the strength to go out and the city center (which is the only place that I like) is so far away and everything is so black and I don’t know what to do I just want all the pain out I want all these thoughts out of my mind I’m desperate. 

I can’t stop crying and I’m empty except for feeling like such a disappointment and worthless. 

I don’t know what to do. I really don’t. Someone please tell me how to kill my self. I don’t really want to die but I can’t keep living like this. 

It’s impossible to help me. I gave up a long time ago. It’s fine for me to die, my family and friends will move on. 

Please someone help me survive (with non cliches please) or die."
3451,Everything is 'supposed' to be okay.,"Everything, especially after all of the hurtful experiences I've been through, is supposed to be okay now. I have a lovely, caring girlfriend. My life is alright for the most part, the worst thing that actively happens in my life that really gets to me is my parents arguing every other night, my life is pretty decent in the fact that I don't have a job but I still get money, and even then I'm still working on a passion project of mine alongside quite a few other people, *so why do I feel like this?* Despite everything, I feel empty. I'm alive, but I don't *feel* alive. There's nothing keeping me going when it truly comes down to it. Even despite all the fun things I *could* be doing and participating in, I feel unmotivated. There's no spark. For me, my life has only cycled back to the times where the very act of living just takes *everything* out of me and I don't know what to do about it. I want to want to live."
3452,I Need help,"I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve never been good at this. I’ve been battling depression since a young teen around 14, 11 years later and things have gone from bad to worse. I barely speak to my family and friends now, i feel like I’m growing apart from my girlfriend, i never want to do anything and i speak as little as possible. My mind feels hazy 24/7, i can’t remember things that i should be able to, i don’t find satisfaction in anything. I have no one to talk to about this because if i tell anyone it’s always “let go and let god” or “stop complaining, you got it better than we do” or the always cheesy “ it’ll be ok, life will get better” and at the same time, i don’t wanna burden others with my problems so i keep them pint up inside. 

My girlfriend used to try to give me sex every time I’d get into one of these moods and i couldn’t even focus enough to maintain an erection, and i can’t even make eye contact with her most times. I try to act like I’m ok when people are around but i feel like i overcompensate and try to be too social and funny and end up using up my social battery in 20 minutes flat.
 
My day consists of waking up, shower, stare at a wall till it’s time to go to work, go to work, come home and stare at a blank wall in complete darkness and silence till i fall asleep and do it the next day again. I know everyone here has their own story but how do you all deal with it?"
3453,Never throw anyone in the garbage that cares about you.,Trust me don't.
3454,I fucking hate people,"I genuinely try to be a nice person to everyone around me. I try to be there for everyone and support everyone around me. It always seems to bite me in the fucking ass though. I always come to find out that the people that I put so much effort into and care so much for, say absolutely terrible things about me. I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve this. It’s really hard for me to reach out and make new friends. I used to be so happy and social, but it seems like every time I reach out, I’m punished for it. The only person that is keeping me alive is my boyfriend. I’m so happy to have found one person in this would that loves me unconditionally. He’s the best thing that’s happened to me, and I don’t know what I’d do without him. I tell him about how afraid I am of going out in public and all that, and he doesn’t care. He helps me to keep fighting, and gives me the strength to talk to people. Despite this, it’s still really hard. I can’t go out without him, and I can’t sleep unless I know he’s safe. I feel embarrassed that I lack even the slightest bit of confidence. I just can’t put myself out there anymore. I feel like everyone that I get close to ends up betraying my trust. I can’t even look people in the eyes anymore. I hate it. I hate that more people can’t be compassionate and understanding. I’ve tried to forgive the people that have caused me so much pain, but I just can’t right now. I’ve come to despise them, and people like them. I truly hope that, one day, I can meet people that are lonely and scared like me, and that we can become friends. I’m confused, frustrated, and tired; but I want to continue."
3455,"Words someone told me, maybe they can kinda help you too","I've lost almost everyone about a month ago and I still can't pull myself together, I'm much more suicidal since then. I was at the party yesterday, my ex-friends were there, one dude was so mean, it turned out no one wanted even to talk with me. I started crying, went outside and decided to go home. One guy stopped me, he asked what had happened (he's my ex-friends' friend and he knows I suffer from depression since few years). We started talking. I said I couldn't make it anymore, I didn't want to be on this world anymore. Then he told me something that made me feel a little better. *""You know, you were depressed earlier, you wanted to die, everything was bad for a long time and yet you survived it. Then you met new people, they've changed your life and everything seemed to be better. Now, I think, you just went back to square one. You feel in the same way you've felt few months ago. And you've survived it earlier, which in my opinion makes you strong, really. Things got better once, which means they can get better again. You should be here and give it all a chance. Sure, it won't always be good, but there will be better times. And they may be truly worth living. Just please, don't give up yet. You've survived so long and I believe you can get better someday. And everything will be easier then.""*

His words remind me of a quote from a song I like: *""and it's always shining somewhere, I just gotta get there""*. I keep telling this myself everyday. **Because we just gotta get there, guys.**

Stay safe y'all and try giving life a chance. There may be nothing to lose, but surely there's so much to get."
3456,A little depression problem.,"   
I don't know if it's a good place for this type of post. I apologize in advance for poor English - most are translated by Google. 

inb4 I can't go to a psychologist because I can't afford it 

   
I'm 19 years old and I'm in a wonderful six-month relationship with the girl I love. I don't know what happened, but during this period of time I ""lost"" all my friends, including 3 people who were really important to me. Some went to college, others just now get along with other people. I have recently tried to renew contact with anyone, but I have been rejected. It was not directly directed to me, ""fuck off"", but it is very easy to feel, because only I came out with initiatives to meet, which the rest were accepted after repeated requests. It was then that something was born in my head that says, ""kill yourself, it doesn't make sense."" I tried to fight it: I was looking for a hobby, I go to the gym, I do website designs, but it still did not give any positive result. All this probably affects my relationship. I feel that it is different because my girlfriend does not spend as much time with me as she ever goes to parties. I feel that if he leaves me, all I can do is be a ball. Can anyone help me? Possibly some way for a quick painless death?"
3457,"What is wrong with my uncle, and how do I better deal with/help him?","Apologies if this isn't the right place to post, but I couldn't find a better subreddit.

Behaviors that appear to be getting worse, very slowly, with time and age:

\- Deep knowledge of specific events such as World War II. But if you asked him to summarize the events of that war, I don't think he could do it. More like a collection of anecdotes. No awareness that the Nazis did evil things -- or even really that there was an ideology behind the war. Consequently he'll do things like send a picture of a Nazi soldier and say ""doesn't he look like so-and-so?""

\- Similarly obsessed with the weather, and weather reports. A big focus of his TV-watching time. 

\- Strong aversion to music and noise of any kind. He doesn't even like Christmas music at Christmas. 

\- Doesn't really listen at all. You can say words, sentences to him but if they're not on a topic he's already familiar with, it's like you never said those words at all. He'll just say ""uh huh, ok, I see, mm hmm"" but if you ask him afterward, it's clear he didn't hear anything. 

\- Strong aversion to technology. Interestingly, he's fine with his iPad and his antenna TVs, though. But he only uses YouTube. He's afraid of other apps, and won't watch Netflix even though we got him a subscription and there's tons of, for example, World War II content. He's afraid of Apple software updates, and annoyed that Apple sends him a weekly email detailing his screen time as though it were a personal attack on him. (He has limitless time as he's retired and receives very few emails.) 

\- Doesn't seem to understand what I do for a living at a basic level. He sends me technology articles on things I'd definitely know because I work in technology, and then explains them to me (mostly just regurgitating what he read) as though I wasn't aware of that topic at all. No awareness that I'm using the same apps, getting the same news feed, that I do this for work all day long. 

\- Despite reading and watching videos/TV a lot, lacks extremely basic knowledge in certain areas. For example he had an iPad for 5 years and didn't know the battery icon represented battery power. He knew he couldn't let the bar go to 0%, and he knew plugging it in made it better. But he didn't know it was battery power; fundamentally he didn't know it was an electrical device. It was a revelation to him, after watching a YouTube video, that there were in fact electronics inside of his iPad. 

\- Very fixed routine. For example, in the morning he watches TV in one room. In the evening, he watches TV in another room. Must be home before dark. 

\- Detailed knowledge of his past which he will often recall, including very minor events attached to specific dates. ""In 1972, I believe it was May 4th, that's when your grandmother had her Uncle So-and-so over to the house."" 

\- Will attach unnecessary attributes to objects, often brand names. For example his ""Lazy Boy rocking chair"" his ""Samsung-brand TV"" when the brand isn't relevant to the conversation. (He's not recommending Samsung, that's just how he talks.) 

\- Strong attachment to the past. For example, he likes the original Battlestar Galactica, but refuses to watch the new one. 

\- Very small world. Focused on observing the day-to-day behavior of his neighbors. Never travels."
3458,What's Happening To Me...,"This is the 3rd time this week that this has happened.

I can literally feel my heart beat like it's banging so hard against my chest and I can barely breath. It just comes out of nowhere while I'm thinking about things and if I don't stop and sit down somewhere alone to calm myself I feel like I'll have a heart attack."
3459,"Getting a partner won't make me feel better, will it?","my brain always tells me that if i just do this one thing i'll be happy. Over the years it's changed. it's a bunch of stupid things that i think if i do it'll make me happy. Wheter it's drugs or new friends or eating more or eating less or cutting myself or whatever it is, i'll always try it, be haoppy for a small amount of time, then either quit when i reliaze it isn't helping or sink into a worst depression. Recently i've been telling myself that because i don't have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, i feel the way i feel. I don't want anyone to tell me i'm gonna be ok or any of that bullshit, because i know you';re lying to me, i just want to know: does getting a partner make the pain stop? I think i already know the answer but i just want proof"
3460,I was wondering if anyone else has this problem...,"My mental health as I've gotten older, has gotten a lot worse.

I've noticed over the last couple years, I tend to always make plans, but I never keep them.

I have good intentions, I just can never bring myself to go out.

Example, today my mother and I we're suppose to go see a christmas play. The tickets had already been bought and everything. We didn't go. My mom has the same issue as I do. I guess I get it from her. She has depression and anxiety. I have a lot more issues, different ones, and the same ones as her.

It makes me even more depressed when I don't keep plans.. I also get disappointed with myself.. I usually end up staying in my bedroom, sleeping or playing Xbox. Lately, this ""issue"" has dramatically gotten worse, to the point I've cancelled important doctor appointments. I have a lot of physical health issues on top of my mental health, so I know that makes me worse mentally. Lately, things have become very difficult for me, maybe that's why the ""issue"" has worsened? I don't know..

I was just curious if anyone else has the same problem.."
3461,Is there anything natural that’s comparable to SSRIs?,"I don’t tolerate antidepressants well. I have a deficiency of a couple different enzymes that break down most antidepressants. I need to be on something. I know lifestyle changes help (exercise, diet) but I feel so shit that I can’t seem to stick to anything that I know will help. I’m doing the best I can here, but it’s not enough. Is anyone here familiar with reliable natural alternatives? Links to any studies or articles would be super appreciated if they happen to be handy. 

Thank you for any advice."

3463,Gently weeps ...,"Another fiscal quarter down, 13 weeks have passed - I work, eat healthy, exercise, keep a clean home and a well groomed, professional appearance.  I’m a parent, grandparent, someone’s child and another’s sibling.  I do the next right thing and yet, I suffer from the moment I open my eyes in the morning until I close them for sleep at night, where I lay gently weeping until sleep claims for my only hours of peace."
3464,Accepting I won't be in the Royal Marines,"So I'm 21 and Ive wanted to be in the marines since i was 16. I went to uni (heavily influenced by others) first and got a 2:1 law degree. December 2017 i got prescribed anti depressants after a 5 min phone call with a doctor, i tried getting an actual appointment but couldnt. So i took those for a month but it had a bit of a placebo effect i think due to it being christmas. I didnt take it any further, but I never go better either. A few months later I saw a doctor about acid reflux and things. I think I have a condition called GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which is like chronic acid reflux, and leaving it can lead to a pre cancerous condition called barrett's oesophagus (thats not where you put a m82 down your throat btw). I also often have digestion issues, i was tested for celiac disease and some other shit at somepoint in 2018 and the results came back fine. Maybe i have a problem eating something in particular i dunno, ive never been able to work it out besides if i drink too much coffee i get the shits lol. I also have 2 wrists that dislocate kind of. And pop back in, and it doesnt hurt really. But ive picked up a 36kg dumbbell before in an awkward way and it popped out and that hurt like hell haha. That happened from doing upright rows with a bar, so dont do it kids, it fucks your wrists, use the ropes or a dumbbell in each hand. To fix it, as far as I know from research, is having metal plates put in.

I think ive been afraid to go to the doctors about these things 1. Just beacuse everyone is haha and 2. Because I'm aware having it on my medical record probably closes doors of careers I had interest in. I understand the importance of good health for a job like in the marines, its everyone elses safety as well as your own, you dont want to be fighting alongside someone whos batshit crazy (im not btw), who might have an episode and shoot you or something. My mate couldnt even get in the army because he used to have eczema 2 years ago, so i dont think there's a chance I could be in the marines if i get diagnosed with some stomach condition and get metal plates in my wrists haha. Like I know deep down I should put my health first, but I guess im finding it hard accepting that, that door has closed. Any response is much appreciated. Thanks."
3465,Endless cycle,If anything I find going to work is good because it forces me to get out of bed  but on the weekend and after work I literally don’t leave my bed. If I do anything it’s just going out drinking and then when I am hungover I have 0 motivation to move. I literally just lie in bed all day and watch tv programs I’ve already seen so I don’t have to focus at all. I always think that I should do something else and then go on Instagram or Facebook and see everyone else out accomplishing stuff and it just makes me miserable. I don’t know how to break the cycle without dedicating myself to something but I don’t know what to do.
3466,"I want to look like the happiest person ever exist, but I can’t.","I never thought that depression is cool, not only once. All I want is to look happy and to be happy. I want to be recognized as an invulnerable person. Never cry, never show tears, never drop my smile. Nothing can defeat me.

Yet, I always feel empty. Why am I living, that’s my biggest question. I lost all my motives.   

please forgive my English"
3467,I hate feeling so unappreciated and unrecognized,"I just finished a painting after 2 years of not doing art because of how depressed I've been. It's a painting of Joker. When I posted it on my snapchat nobody even replied to it or commented on it. Nobody even cared. I also posted it on r/joker and it's gotten 90 upvotes, but I've seen so many other joker artwork posts that have gotten upwards of 500 upvotes, even 1000.

It's not that I base my value off of what other people think of me or their validation, I take pride in my art actually - I'm just so disheartened when time after time after time, my work goes underappreciated and unrecognized. It hurts to spend hours putting every drop of your already almost non-existent motivation into something only for people to not even take 20 seconds out of their time to say something nice about it. I'm drained enough trying to pull myself out of this rut that I'm in, I used all of my energy and willpower to finish this painting, I told myself that I would not let it go unfinished and I didn't. I'm proud of that. But like I said, if you're constantly not being paid attention to and your work constantly goes by unnoticed, you start to question if you're even good enough."
3468,"I Hate Being ""Gifted""","I was told I was so much smarter and more mature than other kids and I slowly became distant from them. As I grew up I became less and less special. I was told time and time again that I was as smart as the smartest kids, I just didn't apply myself the same way. Now I just feel broken. I'm an idiot who everyone seems to expect to be a genius. Worst of all, I believed that I was smart at one point.

I'm not smart. I'm an idiot who doesn't deserve to have the good grades I used to have. I don't deserve the love and affection I've been shown since I never did anything worthy of receiving it.

I'm not gifted, but everyone just expects me to be..."
3469,What is the point?,"I just want to be happy but the world is so fucked. I cant even go outside anymore without feeling sad. I'm scared of the future. I know it's just going to get worse. I constantly think it would be so much easier if I wasnt here. I wouldnt have to deal with life, or the difficult choices I have to make. But then I think maybe it's worth it. I might find something I enjoy, I might find something that will make me happy. How do I cope when the quality of life is absolute shit? I cant afford anything, I cant get anywhere in life. I'm a loser and that's all I will ever be."
3470,Work is hell,Everyday and even starting the day before I have to go to work I get this very bad anxiety that makes me want to escape my life forever. It just feels so horrible and I dread the upcoming hours so much because I know they’ll be spent being somewhere that I don’t want to be at. But since we’re slaves to the system I have no choice but to work or else I’ll end up on the starving streets. Work is so hellish but knowing that it is unavoidable unless you are rich makes it even worse. I just don’t know how much longer I can survive this. Work feels like some prison that I constantly have to escape from. I just want to escape...
3471,"Do any of you find yourself struggling to care about other people due to depression, knowing that this is an evil comfort zone?","I find that my relationship with my family, my friends, and colleagues improves when I have one of those positive days. While experiencing them, I'm very active, interested, engaged. Moreover, I care about other people. I want them to succeed, and I want to build relationships. Then, the next day, I become a bad person. I only care about 'me, me, me'. I become a black hole of emotion, because I cannot even regard another person yet care for them. I struggle to reach out. I feel bored with them. I take them for granted.

Then, when feeling a hint of positivity, I care again. I want to connect, only to have that feeling dissipate moments after. Does anyone else feel like this, and the pang of guilt associated with it? I'm sick of feeling selfish in my depression, and I'm worried that it's become a crutch to convince me to become more isolated.

Sorry for the odd English, it's not my first language."
3473,:),"Always have to put on a fake smile, fake laugh, fake positive attitude. If I show any sign that I’m depressed people get mad at me for still not making any progress towards getting better. They always act so surprised when they see me being depressed. I just want to be left alone."
3474,Leave him alone?,"In September my then boyfriend casually mentioned he was feeling a bit depressed. A week later he fell off the face of the earth and hasn't responded to any of my attempts to make contact since. I dont know if he is depressed or if I've been ghosted. I can make a convincing case for both and genuinely dont know what to do or how to behave. 

Together 2 years, friends for 3 before that. 

My mental health has been suffering because of the constant rejection and uncertainty. I can't stop myself from waiting, wondering and worrying. He hasn't read my messages, but I know he sees them on the screen. He hasnt blocked me. I assume he would block me if this isn't depression?  Can anyone be this cruel? I hate this. I would be devastated and humilaited to find out he's dating. 

He has people in his life, but he's not emotionally close to anyone. I got closest to him. 

Do I

1) Keep trying infrequently, though I will find it hard to move on. 

2) Leave him alone, just stop trying, fall off the face of the earth too. 

3) Leave him alone, but send one last message (treat him as I wish he had treated me)."
3475,A new kind of depressed,"I’ve struggled with depression ever since middle school. I’m 21 years old now. I’ve been depressed to where I have no drive for anything and no desires of any kind. But now for me, I have plenty motivation, and I don’t have periods where I let things go anymore. Life’s pretty decent right now too, but I have this feeling deep down that I just don’t want to be here. I feel this world is just stupid, and I see broken people everywhere, and that just further proves my point that this world we live in is doodoo. I never asked to be born into this world and I really really don’t want to be here. I still love all of my friends and my job and my hobbies and everything, yet I still just don’t want to be here, like at all. Anyways guys, hope this makes sense, I’m just having a hard time understanding what I’m dealing with here."
3476,I still don't know I try anymore.,"I barely try to get by, just till I find the right opportunity to end it all. Eventually I think I'm getting better then something always fucks me over hard and brings me back to square one, what's the fucking point?
I've been stuck here since 7th grade, that makes it 6 and a half years now , does it fucking get better??
If people keep running their fucking mouths "" oh it's gets better, we are with you"", FUCK OFF. Open your eyes to the fact, it doesn't. It gets worse and worse .
Ive anyway decided it's time soon. I'm only waiting for the perfect chance to have my quick way out with as less pain as possible, because I've fucking had enough.
One point was so bad both my arms were just covered in cuts just to feel something physical to numb the mental pain. One day I cut my fucking neck and let some blood loose. It felt fucking good. And right now, as much as I wanna go deep in my arms, I can't because people around me are watching. Once my semester begins, I'll be fine to slash away till I all I fucking feel is pain because the burning on your arms just works God damnit. Eventually the medication I was stopped working and actually fucking made me duller, I used to be so fucking smart and witty and had a good iQ too. It's gone to shit now and I dont think there's anyway out. And sometimes I even get thoughts of wanting to just kill someone random in the most gore way possible. I feel fucking psychotic and Im definitely not gonna contribute anything to this society that's anyway fucked up on a fucked planet that's dying.
What the fuck are we fucking living for?!"
3477,Vitamin D Deficiency &amp; Sertraline?,"For absolute years, however especially present in the past year, I've been extremely chronically tired ALL the time, and loads of other things affecting me. So about a month ago I got blood tests done and I got the results a few days ago and it turns out I am low in iron and severely low in Vitamin D. This means I have to take 40,000 iu of vitamin D per week for 2 months, then after that I'll have to take 1000iu per week for the rest of my life. Has anyone had anything similar to this, and if so, did they notice an alleviation of their depression and anxiety? Or anything else? And does anyone know if I can start my sertraline whilst also taking the vitamin d? I can't ask my doc unless I get an appointment which can be a month wait .. :&lt;"

I have been told that if I started to get better and do better things for myself, things would get better, they did. But I still didn't get what I wanted, I am still not like some people got the chance to be. We all deserve love or whatever else, but this is bullshit, it's not always true

3483,So my girlfriend just broke up with me and I wanna die more than ever,"I've been suicidal since the 9th grade, way before I met her but when I met her I felt that there was still hope for me. She made me feel like I was actually worth something, you know? She made me feel loved and cared for, but she's fucking gone now. No more goodnight kisses, no more ""I love you"", just no more love in general. She was my everything and my only source of happiness. I legit hated almost everything except for her. She was really all I had, and now that all I have is gone, I don't see a reason not to take myself out. Some of you might clown me for acting like that over a breakup, but when I say she was my everything I'm talking she was my EVERYTHING. I loved her with all my heart. She was the only one who I felt was at least a little close to understanding me and how I feel. But as I said she's gone. Haven't cried in years tbh because of how numb I've been feeling, but I think I'm gonna cry myself to sleep tonight."

3488,I cried for the first time in months,"I feel like I’ve been depressed but trying not to acknowledge it. I’m failing 2 of my classes in my senior year of high school, my best friend of 6 years just completely cut ties with me because of his girlfriend, my parents don’t check up on me or push me to do anything and I feel like they’ve nearly given up on me. I have no meaningful friendships. No one makes any attempt to get to know me or seems to have any interest in being around me. I don’t think I’m disliked, but nobody cares enough to get to know me. I feel like I have nobody in my life to make me happy and I am becoming more and more cynical. I don’t like the person I have become but I don’t know how to change. I just don’t feel good enough for anything and I thought I had overcome these feelings years ago. I thought I had made it past these feelings of insecurity and I actually felt happy with my life for a long time this year. All of a sudden I feel like I am nothing. I have no ambition to put effort into anything and I barely even eat. I just want to feel happy again"
3489,the love of my life left me - my story," 

the love of my life left me

we’ve only been dating for a few months, but it’s crazy how such strong emotions can manifest in so little time. we met ages ago, 6 years ago in 7th grade, and despite middle/high school crushes and “are we even dating?’s”, the years passed without a thing happening and we left for college. near the end of high school, i got a boyfriend and when we were reunited summer after freshman year, i was still dating him.

it never should’ve happened — a music festival, too much alcohol in my system… nothing particular happened that day, but that is when it all began. a day or two later we reconnected and i went to his house to play with his cat, and it was clear that he was interested in me. i’ve always thought he was cute, but he definitely glowed up even more in college. he was so sweet, we hung out a lot, and i told him that i didn’t want a relationship with him, i was going back to college in a week, i already had a bf, i wasn’t going to sleep with him — it was just nice connecting with an old friend, and old crush.

but i could only resist so much. he was so, so sweet, he treated me better than anyone had ever treated me, and every time i was with him, i’d get the butterflies that i haven’t felt in so long. at that point, i decided that this wasn’t fair to my boyfriend at the time, so I ended it with him because my emotions were in complete turmoil. i fell in love, fast and hard. in between shots of rum, endless compliments, “i love you’s,” and nonchalant future planning, I fell in love. he was everything I had ever wanted, and the only thing i wished was that we started dating earlier.

the week of bliss ended, but the happiness didn’t end even after we left for college. he was still so so sweet to me, he’d call me every day, compliment me every day, tell me he loved me every day. whenever we argued, he promised that though things are hard now, we would work through it together — always. that we’d be together forever. so many promises broken… i was scared, i’ve always been insecure, but this boy really had a way of melting away my insecurities… i was truly smitten. at one point, he even flew across the country to spend a weekend with me, and though he was tired and inevitably jet lagged, it has been one of my best weekends in college.

everything began to fall apart. i still don’t know why, or how it began. but it started with a drop in compliments, a drop in “i love you’s,” a drop in call times, a drop in messages. i didn’t know what was happening, i was scared, and I asked him for more. he never delivered. everything spiraled downwards from there — daily arguments, i threw away any pride and begged him for his attention, it was chaotic and it was scary. then it came, he didn’t want to do it anymore. he didn’t think we were working out, he didn’t want to be with me anymore. so many reconciliation attempts. i promised I would try my hardest, that i wanted to believe in us, that i wanted to be with him forever… i love him and even now, i can’t see myself with anyone other than him… he was my future. we decided to hold off until the next break, and when we were together again, everything was right again. we decided to try again.

not even a week later, everything spiraled out of control again. i fell apart, and tried to take my own life. it was a disaster. when i was discharged from the hospital, he gave me his verdict — no more. there is no more try, he has long fallen out of love and has no desire to be with me anymore.

he doesn’t want us anymore. not even a little bit.

when the man who promised you forever, the man who you believed wholeheartedly would never leave, leaves…. 

i don’t know.

i don’t know how this all happened. how something so good turned into something so bad. how i can’t make the one person i want to stay stay. he was my everything.

i spend so much of my time thinking about him, usually it’s unconsciously, and usually it’s good, warm feelings of love. but then reality hits me — he’s not mine anymore, he never will be. he was supposed to be mine forever.

i have so much regret. if i never went to that music festival, if i never reconnected with him, none of this would’ve ever happened. i was happy before we reconnected, but now, i am anything but. i am miserable, i am devastated. i’m writing this amidst finals week, and i don’t know how to study. i can’t. i just sit there and cry. there is a permanent tightness in my chest and no matter what i do, it won’t go away. whenever i try to think, only tears come.

we had so much. we had so much planned for the future. we were going to spend Christmas, together, go ice skating, kiss under mistletoes. we were going to celebrate our one year at my favorite restaurant, we were going to get married, have two children, adopt a dog. so many broken promises.

i would truly give anything to have our original relationship back. it was a dream. too good to be true.

i don’t know what i’m going to do moving forward. despite how much he’s hurt me, i still want to be with him. oftentimes, i feel as if dying would be better than living a life without him.

he was the love of my life. he swept me away, and i foolishly gave him everything I had. now, he’s left me with nothing. nothing but memories and regret."
3490,How to live knowing I’ve done bad things??,"I’ve done a lot of bad things. I’ve hurt a lot of people. Some of it I’ve tried to make right and some of it I’ll never be able to fix.

I don’t know how to live in a world where I can’t fix things. 

I want to tell them I’m sorry and do what I can to make it better. Maybe it’s selfish of me to not want to feel so awful all the time... but I swear that’s not the only reason. 

I care about people. I am overjoyed when they are overjoyed and I am devastated when they are devastated. I really really do care about people. 

And I’ve hurt them anyways when I didn’t mean to and it’s just... so awful.

I don’t know what to do or how to move forward. Because if I don’t think I deserve a good life, I won’t try and move forward."
3491,Good friends are hard to find,"In movies they show friends being supportive towards each other but I am not even in priority for my friends. It doesn't matter what ever I do for them they don't even acknowledge that but if I make one mistake they just put me down like anything.

I don't know what to do"
3492,Idk what to do,my only friends thinks that i'm faking my depression and anxhiety (i'm not officialy diagnosed) saying that i cannot have those since they have even worse problems and they say the know peeps with depression that didn't vent much like i did they called me an attention whore telling me that i just have to grow some balls and don't be a fake pussy even because i always act like i'm happy when i'm with them (i always put on a mask to fake out myself). meanwhile i live everyday with that think in my head and i always struggle to live normaly even before they called me like that i have realy often an anxhiety attack i'm not on some ad or similar and i don't have time for therapy and even cannot afford it there is no school consuelor in my school i have even many suicide plans ready with a suicide letter that i'm gonna finish after this new year (date when i'm planning to end all this shit by killing myself) i'm struggling with all this shit for 7 years (except anxhiety attacks those are for 5 years) my parents wouldn't believe me too since i always mask up even to them so idk what to do
3493,My friend came back from a boot camp!!,It was really nice to talk to him again. It made my day— I guess good things do happen in midst of turmoil
3494,Meeting With a Psychiatrist Next Week,"Just as the title says, I'm meeting with a psychiatrist next week to be assessed for antidepressants. I've been dealing with some deep depression paired with suicidal thoughts and plans. My therapist (different than the psychiatrist I'm meeting with) helped me set up the appointment when I was feeling at my lowest about a month ago. The fact that I had to wait a month for an opening is whole other thing that speaks for itself.

For those of you who have been assessed for antidepressants, what are some questions you asked the psychiatrist? What are some things you wished you had asked? To be clear, I'm not asking anyone to speak to anything they feel is too personal. Mostly looking for side effect related questions, but any advice in general is appreciated. I'm a 32m I'd that's relevant."
3495,Just broke down crying in the grocery store,"I had to drop the basket I was carrying and went to my car and started balling my eyes out. This holiday season has not been good to me I have been depressed for most of my life but these are the past month or so it has been the strongest of my life. I feel sad pretty much 24/7. I resent the weekdays because I don't like my job, but at least that gives me something to do. Somewhere to go. The weekends when I have absolutely nothing to do are the worst. I miss having people. I miss her. Even the random tinder whores blow off their plans with me. I think I am going to go back in and actually try shopping because I need food. Hopefully I can manage it."
3496,What is even the point?,"I'm just dredging along anymore. I've barely been hanging out with people, I feel like they don't really want to be around me now, whether I'm mind reading or not. Holidays and winter make everyone feel worse, but things just seem especially bad recently. I've got a lot going on, and I know I should give myself credit, but it just feels like I'm accomplishing nothing. Going to school for a degree that I don't want, but might as well finish, then repeating the process for something that I can only hope will give me some passion. 

I have a concert that I dropped $400 on because, yanno, retail therapy and all that, and that's basically all I have to look forward to right now. My insurance has a crazy high deductible, so I can't afford counseling, and I can't get cheaper insurance, since it's offered through my work. I'm just screwed everywhere I turn, and I don't know what to do anymore."
3497,I don’t know anything anymore.,"I am so wildly unhappy, I think. I try to find little moments of happiness and sometimes I do but a little pocket of happiness lasts about as long as a breath does and then it’s back to a mix of perpetual indifference and irritability. 
Everyone, I mean EVERYONE gets on my nerves at all times. I can’t continue living like this. Idk what’s wrong. At the same time I need friends, I’m always alone and I can’t sleep at night, sometimes I go days without speaking to an actual person and I don’t think that’s healthy. Idk what’s wrong. I’ve never been diagnosed with depression but maybe that’s what this is. Thanks for reading."
3498,I’m ready,"I’m ready to die. It’s became my main goal in life. Not enjoying my life here on Earth, yes I know it’s my fault. I don’t care anymore"
3499,Anti depressants,"I've been adviced to go in anti depressants (it's supposed to be a mild one escitalopram) but I'm kinda worried about the side effects and it makes me feel even more defeated and dependant. 

Does anyone have experience or advice?"
3500,Moments of clarity,"Usually depression leaves me numb, zombie-like, unmotivated. But then I have these fleeting moments of clarity where I'm still depressed as fuck, but I feel some what motivated. And you know what the first thing I wanna do is? Kill myself. Because usually I don't even have the motivation to do that."
3501,Why dont i have anybody who will love me?,I dont even know what to say or do i just want to love and feel loved but i have noone for that. If at least i had time and energy to meet new people but i have neither. It hurts so much and idk what to do
3502,I have problems in asking for help,"Ever since I got depressed, I've never tried asking for help, and that aplies to other things too. When I struggle with something, I don't ask for help, and just try to do it myself. When ever I'm in an unfamiliar situation and have problems, I try to wait for soneo e to come to me to ask me if I need help. It's really difficult for me to look for help, and that has lead to bad situations. Even sometimes when I get the chance to talk about my problems, I just don't. And that reflects to the test of my life, I never aproach first or start a conversation. And that's my huge problem that I can't seem to be able to fix."
3503,Why have I always hated myself?,"It makes very little sense. I have always hated almost everything about my self. Yet, I know I'm a above average looking fit 6,5 guy. Recently I have developed a theory. Basically it comes down to that suicidal thoughts and acting on those is a modern day form of evolution. I'm a person that apparently cannot exist in this world happily. I'm a person that cannot succeed at anything. Why would my genes stay in the gene pool? Why would I recreate and just continue the cycle of failure? I honestly think it's a good theory. Evolution is cruel. It doesn't give a fuck about if you're weak or sad, actually that's what evolution filters out. So I'm glad in a way that I finally have some purpose. I can help evolution on it's way by doing the right thing as soon as possible. So yeah, I have decided. Either I never experience none of this shit that I'm goin through again, or I'm pulling the trigger. I dont care if it lasts 1 more year and then my next 60 will be good. I just cant take that one year. 
So, see y'all later!"
3504,How low can we go!,"What miserable things will happen today! Been awake for an hour and already made a fool out of myself at the grocery store and got dirty looks by employees, almost got ran over but the fucker stopped. Last night was talking normal to my friend a few hours later they ignored me and as soon as I left started talking again in chat to my other friend. What's happened to you so far?"
3505,I feel like my life is destined to be unhappy,
3506,I’m thinking about trying Prozac..,Because my primary care suggested it and says it seems to have the least side effects for men. I’m so afraid to try anti depressants. Ever since our third was born I’ve been struggling with anxiety and I think depression. I doubt myself and my condition a lot and there is a lot of guilt I struggle with. On my days off I feel bad doing things I like. I really like playing video games but I always end off feeling guilty looking them. I stay home with our three children Saturdays while my wife goes to work. I work 4 10hr shifts every week. This turned into a lot more than I expected but I realized I wanted to say more. I hope Someone can relate and give me advice about trying medicine. Also I plan to start therapy next year.
3507,Torn,"Right now I don’t know how to feel about still being alive. Recently shit went down between me and my parents and I regret living because of multiple issues, however yesterday I had a good reassuring phone call with a good friend that kinda made me grateful I lived. I just have nothing to look forward to (my parents don’t approve of my best friend and the band we started, which was the one reason why I was living), I only trust a few people and the rest have betrayed me, my life is controlled, other people’s expectations are too high for me, I fucked up my life and I feel like no one cares."
3508,"Depression can be rearranged to ‘I press on’ you’re all braver than you think. Your life matters, you matter!","Hi, *to your inner brain*

I want you to know that you won’t know me, but im here for you! Whether you want to rant or  shout, ill listen :) I know it seems hard right now but you are loved you are important and you matter. Don’t give in and listen to those negative thoughts or people, you can do it!"
3509,I just needed somewhere to vent and I thought some writing might make me get a more objective perspective on my situation.,"I have been depressed for a several years now. I have my ups and downs, but it’s severe this time of the year. I like to blame it on that I live far north, and the sun only stays up 3 hours a day during winter setting a downcast mood that effects all people living here I would assume. I’m in my early twenties and entered university this autumn in a tough engineering program after having worked while getting my countries equivalent of the SAT scores up the years after high school. 

I have a lot of friends that I see often. I have traveled with both my friends and my family all over the world. I come from a wealthy family and my parents are the most supporting parents you can get. I haven’t told them about my state, but I know that they have a good idea of my situation. My dad especially has tried to make an admirable effort for me to open up, but I just can’t do it. This middle ground there both parties know but don’t share it with each other is comfortable in an odd way but I know it’s not fair towards my family. I have however opened up briefly to two of my best friends about it but I attenuated how bad I actually feel when I brought it up. The whole situation just makes me feel guilty. That I shouldn’t be somebody that should be depressed. That I’m just a spoiled brat that should have no business in feeling like I do and just want an excuse to feel sorry for myself.

I spend most of my days sitting in front of my computer. I haven’t been able to go to university for several weeks. I have learned to know some good people there, but I just can’t get myself to get myself to attend the classes. I just sleep most of the day. Sleep is probably what I would consider one of the biggest problems in my life. I sleep way too much which often lead to my turning around the clock. I also experience sleep paralysis a lot, but that mostly happens after I have slept over 8-10 hours and continue sleeping.

I have an immense self-hatred, yet I also show narcissistic behaviours at times, at least when it comes to my appearance. But I think that is founded in my anxiety and self-hatred as well. I want to try to see myself in a positive light in some way or another might be the cause of this. When it comes to anything to do with other people putting me in the spotlight, like my birthday or when I was able to get into university, I try to find any excuse for that not to happen. Often just by saying that I feel uncomfortable with being in such a position. My parents and my friends respect that.

I think about suicide from time to time but not in a way that I would ever consider doing it. The damage that would do towards the people around me would be unforgivable. 

The bottom line of this post is that I just needed to put everything it into words. I appreciate those of you read through it and hopefully it didn't come out too much like it's pseudo intellectual garbage. English is not my native language so I’m sorry if some of what I have written isn’t clear enough."
3510,I never understood people wanted to end thier lives but I think that's genuinely time.,"Hey guys 

Writing a post like this is so hard... Isn't it funny even though I'm about to explain some of the reasons I don't wanna be here my subconscious is still winging ""but what if you sound silly"" what if people don't agree with my Perception.... But ide be dead? Maybe it's my own fucked up way of delaying it, cause people are right when they say ""you don't write about it online first you just do it"" I get that but here goes short as I can.

Was with a girl for 3 years broke up moved on (went traveling, worked all over the world) 


Met a girl travelling who I would go onto spend 4 years with, this was the ""big one"" never truly got over it, changed me forever, fell Into drug abuse. So fast forward a long time recovering and I'm with another girl its the first time i felt anything real for anyone in maybe 4 years, she agreed to marry me, the next day we have an argument cause I embarrassed her (I've apologized obviously over and over) but now I'm just done guys, I've got the needle ready that will kill me easily, my biggest passion was writing music so I'm doing that, trying to write something about the good parts of my life, it's all pretty hard eh?"
3511,Does everyone suck by default?,"How does one cope with the dejected feeling when your friends don't reply to you?  I probably could use some more patience, but damn, there are some hearless aholes out there! 

I feel like I always respond to every text/email/call Ok receive and if it's delayed, I always apologize because I know how it feels to not get a response in the moment.  

Maybe technology is just exposing an insecurity of mine."
3512,I didn’t choose to be depressed,I hate people making me feel guilty for having depression. I know there are many others that have it worse than me. It’s not like I want to be this way.
3513,I miss her so much,"I can't get over everything I've done with her

She broke up with me a few days ago and I fucking wish I could've been better for her

I wish I was never depressed so she could've stayed with me

I begged her not to but she just laughed and called me fake.

I miss her

I love her so much, and why does it have to end, why couldn't I fix myself more for her"
3514,It's not fun to fail anymore,"I think this is the main problem with today's modern society (and a major cause of depression and anxiety amongst many youth).

We're each one of us creating an environment where we take every little thing too serious. There is no play anymore.

This is sad. Everyone acts like he/she is going to live forever. What happened to people?

Seems like nobody is willing to give you a chance to express yourself if you are not their perfect image.

We're not creating REAL safety nets anymore. 

I struggle with this so hard. 

I try to cope with physical activity. It makes me feel better but just for a little while, it really doesn't do anything long term and honestly I'm tired of doing the same exercises alone. 

As I'm writing this, I haven't gone outside today. 

I usually go for some exercise everyday but I'm starting to have panic attacks when I go out. 

Seems like everybody is a zombie.

I don't understand anymore. Sorry for mixed thoughts"
3515,Finals,"I’ve never had to try so hard to focus and understand with the little energy I have in my brain. It’s so difficult caring about your studies with depression, this sounds dramatic but studying this past week has been the hardest thing I’ve ever accomplished. I truly did not think I would end up finishing all my finals, i guess for once in a very long time I actually am proud of myself."
3516,I feel so numb,I feel so numb to things in life. I can smile and laugh but it never feels fully or whole. It feels that my body is only capable of giving 50% and even then it’s a struggle. Anyone else feeling the same way?
3517,"“Not today, Mother Fucker!”","Me: 11,315. Depression: 0

I’ve been severely depressed with the accompanying side effects since 5 years old—it’s been a nightmare. I’ve gone through hundreds of meds, been in hospitals, therapy, acupuncture, mj...  You name it, I’ve tried it. 

Every day is a struggle to just get up, but when that bastard depression tries to shake me down, I evoke my inner Sergeant Doakes, and tell it, “Not today, Mother Fucker!” I get a little chuckle at my morbid inner-humor and force myself up to keep my “perfect score” going. My victories may not be pretty, and I am weary and battle-scarred, but I’ve never let depression win one single day. 

Ive notice a lot of teenagers and 20 somethings on here. I feel for you all. Those were “unbearable” times for me as well. Hormones, chemical imbalances, finding yourself. I felt the same way as every one of you, but somehow I’m still here. Why? I was given this life to live and not to die. Waste not, my friends. 

Oh yes, I’ve begged for it, fantasized about it, and even done enough research to receive an honorary degree in it. However, every day you live through, it becomes a little more bearable. You gain a little more XP in life and start to learn how to cope and side-step. It hasn’t ever gone away, and I don’t think it ever will, but I’ve become stronger and can fight back physically and mentally. I’ve become a better person oddly enough. 

If I can fight back, then so can each and every one of you. Suicide is the easy way out. It’s the hard reset with no reboot that leaves the people you left behind crushed. Your pain ends, but another’s begins. That can’t be allowed. You are stronger and a better person than that. 

So each morning when I say, “Not today, Mother Fucker!” I’m talking to *you* too. Call it tough love or whatever you want, but I’m a Depression Four Star General at this point, and I know what you are capable of because I was: fighting back!"
3518,Horrible,There's nothing left to lose :)
3519,Crying in my car at 21,"I’m sat hear crying in my car at the thought of turning 21 tomorrow . If you had told me at the ages between 13-16 I would make it to 21 I wouldn’t have even given the thought the time of day . I was never suicidal but I didn’t see a way I could possibly be alive any more either , I just felt nothing towards the world and felt that I was just going to be swallowed up by the earth and that was that .   I spent 2 and a half years of my teenage years manically depressed and riddled with anxiety ,  I never wanted to die I just didn’t want to be alive either if that makes  sense I just felt nothing at the world and everything at the same time . There was no emotions like happiness , sadness , joyful , empathy , love , anger or any kind of human emotion but I was terrified of the world outside my house at the same time . I was removed from school and the rest of the world just disappeared . I can’t really tell you much from those 2 and a half years , I’m not sure if I have chosen to forget it or if my brain is purposely with holding it for trauma reasons but either way I don’t think I could distinguish 5 days in that time . Birthdays , Christmas , celebrations and other important events are non existent in my memory . We battled  threw it and I was thankful enough to have a support system that  fought for me when I couldn’t .  I know that’s not something everyone has but I’m so thankful I had it . I got put on medication after many months of my mum fighting for me to get it , I had unlimited sessions of different types of CBT once the medication allowed me to access CBT  and I made a choice  . My choice was that I knew realistically I couldn’t be happy everyday but I wanted to wake up with the possibility to feel happy every day . And in time that happened life started moving again and I began to feel again . 

I cried today for the girl who I was and who I am , for all the people my mental Illness caused pain to , for all I missed out on and for all the problems it caused .  , I can not express how much my life today means to me not everything is perfect but there in an unlimited amount of potential for my future and that’s something I could never have imagined I am happy and I am grateful   to be alive . There’s a lot more to this story and it was very dark in places but what this was meant to be about is I can’t promise it will get better but I really hope it does for you . I know that every persons story is different but 21 is looking pretty amazing right now and I just wanted to share that ."
3520,We Don’t help either,Just seems to me that others in our exact same position tend to look the other way. We get a “I’m going through enough myself” kind of attitude and just stray off. Why can’t the depressed befriend the depressed ?
3521,"Being alone hurts,like i love being alone away from people and at the same time i cry when am alone and hate life,its bad because am 18 and have no friends at all,any solutions?",
3522,is it possible to get depressive episode even tho im on meds?,"[22,F] hello im on venegis and desyrel and last week my doctor raised my dosage but for the last few days i can feel getting worse? feeling ashamed, down, having suicidal thoughts etc. i wonder what may be the reason?"

3524,Getting pretty freaked out here.,"I'm really struggling right now to the point where I'm afraid to leave my house.  The depression and anxiety crept in and now are crippling me again.  I don't know how to overcome it.  I really have stuff I need to do but I feel paralyzed.

And repeat.

So far, I've only been asked if I was interested in doing that job. Nothing is signed yet, I don't have any precisions, etc. All I know is that I've been approached for it. I can't help but have the feeling nothing will follow. If it doesn't... then there's no hope for me. I will officially believe I'm just not meant to be happy. That it only happens to others."
3528,I don't know what I'm waiting for anymore,Everyone's gone. I'm waitlisted for medical help since the symptoms have been getting much worse and drove everyone I loved away. There's no date of when I'll receive help. I've tried calling my doctor to no avail. I feel like I'm just frozen in time. I don't know what I'm waiting for anymore. 2020 is around the corner and I don't know if I want to be a part of it
3529,"Visiting a friend in a psych ward, are these good things to bring her?","A  good friend of mine is currently going thru depression. I have  struggled with it myself in the last years and I have the strong urge to help her. She is a super sweet person and I really like her a lot. We live in diffrent cities which  makes it kinda hard for me to support her. She currently is in a  psych  ward and I plan to visit her next week and want to bring her a few  little things.

I'm really unsure what to give her but I have a few things on my list:

&amp;#x200B;

The  first one is a book from Alan Watts. It's a lot about eastern  philosophy and the way we see ourself. It helped me to get a diffrent  perspective on myself and I think it may helps her aswell. She is a really smart person. There is a special chapter that I find important  that I will maybe mark for her.

&amp;#x200B;

The  second one is a playlist/set I made for her. It includes a lot of slow  and sad tracks but also some more light and happy ones. I have a strong  emotional bond to all of them. I choose them because these are some of  the songs I used to listen to in times when I felt like shit, when there  was nothing I wanted to do and I was just sitting around feeling empty.  They always helped me to feel a little less bad and I hope it will do  the same for her.

&amp;#x200B;

The  third thing on my list is a little sticker that says ""Nice that you're  here"". I plan to stick it somewhere hidden when she's not looking, so she will find it a day later or so.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  super unsure if these are the right things to give her. Is it to much?  Is it not enough? Are these the wrong things to bring her?

There  is also the ""problem"" that I have some fellings for her. I don't know if she still is in a relationship. I'm quite sure she  also always had some feelings for me but I don't think it's the right time to approche  this.  Maybe if she directly shows me that it is what she wants. Otherwise she needs to get better first before I do anything, I  don't want to make things weird and make her worry about our friendship.

So what do you guys think about it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if anyone is interested in the playlist/set I would be happy to share it. Maybe it's not the music she likes and it won't help her but maybe it will help some stranger."
3530,I feel like things are getting less and less significant as days pass by,"Honestly, my parents are the only people keeping me from killing myself, I can’t imagine their faces if they were to see their son’s lifeless body, but days after days and the urge is getting stronger, I hate the fact that I feel this way, I hate thinking like this, I hate thinking. In my opinion , I think the ability to think is s curse. You start to realize that nothing really matters in this big of a fucking universe, but holy fuck I don’t wanna kill myself while my parents are still alive. After all they did for me, it’s fucking painful to imagine. I don’t think talking to someone helps anymore. It’s all “you can do it!”, “you’re gonna be alright someday” etc. It’s all the same crap and it’s becoming insignificant to me. Things like that really blurs out your perspective of the word “friends”. 

Sorry for blurting out nonsense but it really be like that sometimes."
3531,I need help with talking to my mom. Or just some support. Or anything.,"For years I was always hiding my true feelings, always pretending that I am fine, so no one would ask, no one would worry, everyone would just left me alone. 

But recently, my whole life situation started to be a complete mess. In months I could not find a job. I dropped from uni. Everything is worse. My depression got worse, my social anxiety skyrocket. I am not okay. I could not pretend so well anymore, people start noticing that I am not the same person. And start asking questions, to which I was not able to anser.   

With holidays approaching, I wish I could tell everything to at least my mom. The problem is, that actually SHE was the problem for years. I love her, she is not a bad person. But her expectations were crushing me for years. I was always trying to live up to them, but I completely failed now. And she, as really honest person, told me that she is dissapointed. That broke me.

She was struggling with depression, she is better now. It was mostly caused by her toxic mother. She told me lots of times, that she is scared that some day she may start to behave like grandma. And I don't want to make her think so. I don't want her to worry. I feel like telling her about my depression and being open with my failures will cause her to fall into worse state again.

But I know that eventually I have to open. I don't have energy to pretend anymore. For half a year or so, I was avoiding contact with her, while before that I used to call her even every few days to talk about some trivial things. And some serious ones too. We had good contact. I miss that so much. But I'm scared that if I will be open, our relationship will never be the same.

I hope that she can understand. But what if not? Everything will  be messed up even more. I can't live like this anymore, with lies and masks and pretending. 

This post is a mess. I'm sorry. Maybe I just needed to vent. I don't even know what am I asking for."
3532,I don't know.,"So, yesterday, my school semester ended and I finished with a 3.75 GPA. I'm gonna make Dean's List for the first time in my life. Next Month, I'm going to be 100% debt free, other than student loans. I have a beautiful Fiance who I will be marrying in May of 2020, who has always been supportive of everything I do. 

 Today, I wake up and I'm depressed. Like, stuck in a never ending hole.   I hate this stuff, because even at a time like now, where I should be overtly happy, I'm not. It is something I have struggled with for over 20 years and I am just coming to grips with the fact that no matter what I do, this feeling is going to be around. Not meaning this to be self loathing, just wanted to get my feelings out there and I honestly do not like talking to family or friends about it too much, because I feel like they just won't get it. 

Most times, I just jump in my car and crank some music and it helps, but this is one of those bad bad BAD days. 

I hope everyone on here has a wonderful weekend and a fantastic holiday season."
3533,Oh shit! Why do I waste time talking random strangers over internet:(,I should study instead of wasting time like this.. what the actually fuck.. I have to drag myself to study! I love to study.. and excel in school.. still fucking internet is again trying to postpone my studies...
3534,What's the most depressing thought you'd ever had?,"For me, it's about being left behind! I feel like all the happy things in life happen to people and not to me. I'm not trying to be whiny but just putting it out there."
3535,I used to be a dreamer...,"I used to find what little solace I could in my dreams. 

Dreams of my aspirations coming to fruition and reaching my goals (and honestly aren't unrealistic, the biggest being moving). It was the only motivation I had to hold on to. I've been severely depressed the majority of this decade. Mostly because I build myself up, only to have it torn back down each time. Once-in-a-lifetime opportunities arise time after time, only for me to close the door on them (long stories). However what tiny shred of hope I had left was in my dreams. Dreams of a better place, a better situation, of a possible future and outcomes, and they'd be so real. That's what kept me going. It's as if my subconscious was my personal motivator.  


Now those dreams reflect the hopelessness I feel, those dreams mirror my reality. They no longer offer motivation; rather , they now serve as a method to reinforce my situation. I can no longer escape the crushing feeling of being trapped like a bird in a cage.

I no longer have that tiny shred of hope they offered.  


tl;dr even my dreams now reinforce my feelings of hopelessness and mimic the way I feel day to day."

3537,How to support a girlfriend with depression and stay strong,"My girlfriend (44f) is depressed and is shutting me (37m) out and pushing me away

The uncertainty in my current relationship continues but it seems I'm learning more and more about it's cause as I had thought it was a numerous different things up until this week. I (37m) met this wonderful girl (44f) via an online dating app in September of this year and we got along and connected immediately. Things seemed almost too good to be true and it felt like we both really understood one another, had all the same aspirations for our life and within a month of being together we were telling each we loved one another. The following month we were talking about marriage at some point down the line and how crazy it seemed that everything was going as well as it was. The only thing not going great was sex, we were having lots of sex which was good but as she was on Zoloft and Wellbutrin for depression she was having trouble consistently reaching orgasm. We had planned a trip to New Orleans and unknown to me she talked to her doctor and decided to wean herself off Zoloft and increase her Wellbutrin dosage. She told me about this decision and I supported her choice however with some trepidation as she had told me the last time she went off zoloft she became depressed and that's actually how her last relationship ended and she thinks was how her marriage from a couple years ago ended as well that she became depressed. Thinking because of how good the relationship was, how happy she was and I was, I think we were both naive to think she wouldn't experience those symptoms again. She had said multiple times up to that point that this relationship was the best she's ever had, that she has never felt loved or loved anyone like this before, how she felt her father who passed as a child had sent me for her, etc. etc. I was eating this all up of course and saying similar things back because it really did feel like I had found a person I could spend my life with. I'm a hopeless romantic afterall...

Within a week of going off the zoloft, which was about 6 weeks ago, she started to get in a funk as she called it. She became ""flat"" with her emotions and didn't feel happy/sad or anything. We went on out trip and enjoyed ourselves for the most part but she definitely wasn't the same. We continued spending time together and she continued to communicate her feelings and that although she was feeling somewhat depressed that she wanted to get through the complete weening off process. The sex was better for her and she was reaching orgasms more consistently and would say how great it was and that it felt good but over the last week or so she has entered a complete depressive state. She is isolating herself from everyone, including me. We still talk most days but it's nothing like it was even a week ago. We use to talk or text throughout the day up until this week and the last couple days it's been a good morning text, maybe a couple texts during the day and a good night text. She has cancelled all the plans we've made this week and although we had planned for a nice dinner out tomorrow night for a few weeks now at her favorite restaurant that is now being cancelled too as she said yesterday that the being around any people, including me, is causing her bad anxiety. We have another trip planned the first week of January as well and anytime I've tried talk about that now, the subject is changed or she'll ignore texts about it. I want to believe this is all the depression but now that I'm nearly completely shut out I am really struggling as she is no longer communicating what she is feeling or what she is going through. My feelings have changed towards the relationship lately which I feel guilt for, I question if that initial rush I had with her was a rebound for both of us as I'm recently out of a marriage from May and her last relationship ended in April and overall I'm just struggling with what to do.

TL/DR

How do I support my girlfriend when she is shutting me out and pushing me away?"
3538,Why live?,"I have faint recollection of what it was like to be happy. Truly, the few moments of joy I have monthly do not seem to merit living any longer. 

Every morning and every evening when I'm in my bed, staring at my ceiling, I feel the worst kind of pain, an isolation consuming me, never to let me go. This is what life had become for me. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that something horrible will happen to me and I can just fade into nothingness.

Why choose to live when everyday is a chore?"
3539,I don’t know how am I supposed to feel.,".

I didnt know of a subreddit that deals with these kinds of things so I’m posting this here. I am generally a kinda socially awkward guy and I don’t like going outsider too much. But wherever I see my friends outside (partying or some social gatherings like today), I feel kind of sad. I can’t explain it but it really hurts me in some way inside me. At this point, I don’t even know who is real or who is fake or who is a friend."
3540,Broke down crying at my friends wedding yesterday.,"Yeah my friends wedding was yesterday and it was a lovely event and I had a good time. My friends made me feel welcome and even though I struck out with the milf I was chatting with it was overall positive.

Except for the part where the groom danced with his mom and it hit me with this tidal wave of emotions about my own mom and how shes dying and most likely wont live to see my wedding. I had to get in my car and cry it out for a good hour or so. My friends each coming to check up on me which made me feel so guilty because I was pulling them away from this special event to help me with my shit. Even at events that are supposed to be happy my brain finds a way to weasel in my dark personal thoughts to ruin it for not just me but everyone around me.

Just wanted to share because getting my thoughts out there helps. Hope everyone is doing good today."
3541,I wish someone would notice and help me,"My family doesn’t care about how I’m feeling. They just dismiss my problems and call them “small”. They compare my problems to everyone else’s, invalidating my own because it seems like it’s not that serious. My mom won’t talk to me or even consider giving me the support I need to get through this. My friends don’t care either. They don’t want to deal with the burden. 
They just use me for comfort, step on me and then leave without asking me if I’m okay. 

I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I had someone who would care about me. I feel so alone and drained all the time. I don’t know what to do. It gets harder each day to keep going."
3542,Joined reddit today,Hi everyone so i don't know if i'm doing right pardon me if i go wrong anywhere so i joined reddit today just so i can talk or tell my condition maybe idk if it's depression or not i just find it really hard to talk to people i judge myself i have been an extrovert now it's just so numb and empty inside it's just so hard for me to talk to anybody even if i try i can't its eating me alive.
3543,Cheated on my real life girlfriend by dating a girl who suffers from depression I met online playing games,"This all happened while I was still dating my girlfriend while she was away for an internship.

So I met a nice girl online playing a game almost like 2 months ago and the vibes between us are good. 
I confessed to her and wr started dating online. The only problem is that she seems to suffer from depression and im trying to help her, sometimes staying really late or not sleeping just to keep her company, playing games with her, shes really beautiful. She's from another country not far from here, and I want to meet her. 

My girlfriend came back recently  and found out about that I was texting and dating another girl. I dumped my girlfriend inmediately after this. I feel really sorry for her. From time to time I still miss her, last week I had been trying to contact her to make it up but she ghosted me. I miss the intimacy with her. I tried with another number but she's not picking up my calls nor answering. 

TL;DR: Cheated on my real girlfriend by dating another girl I met online playing games. Dumped my real girlfriend and now I miss her.

What should I do?, any kind of advice would be appreciated."
3544,Just wrote this down and I feel like I need to share it,"***I don't know where to start***

***Because there's pain inside my heart***

***a wound that won't heal***

***a scab that's been peeled***

***my chest feels cold as steel***

***as empty as a field***

***in my hand I hold a knife***

***so when the time is right***

***I will end my life***"
3545,This may break me,"Last year began with me folding a company I'd been trying to build for 4 years and poured 40k into and it ended with a divorce I didn't want.  This year began with me selling/cleaning out our house on my own bc she wanted nothing to do with it but reap the rewards and now it has ended with me being forced to resign my job. I try to tell myself that despair is lazy and hope it's a discipline off the heart. I try to practice positive thinking but I think I'm done. I have my boys until Tuesday then I think I'm ending it.

I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, medication hasn't helped. I don't have the strength to move forward anymore"
3546,"I lost a friend yesterday and I woke up and I can’t stop throwing up, hoe do I make it stop?","TLDR is I lost my best friend last night, they were just like hey if you can’t do x, then we can’t be friends anymore. 

I knew this person for 4 years and we dated on and off. They were the most important person in my life and now they’re gone. I woke up and the full gravity of it all hit me like a train and I’ve been throwing up constantly. The only thing that made it stop was I ran out of shit in my stomach to throw up. I’ve been dry heaving like crazy, I don’t have the motivation to eat or drink anything and even if I did, it’d just come back up. 

Does anyone know how to help ease the shock of everything or at least know any tips on how to stop throwing up?"
3547,can anyone talk to me please?,
3548,when will I stop feeling like I want to kms,"waking up every day fucking sucks I hate being here. being alive brings me almost no joy anymore and with each passing day this winter, the ideation to leave this earth gets stronger and stronger. what even is there for me here"
3549,new decade same me,"its just around the corner, to make it even more of a deal the end of a decade. how does so much happen in the past two? im still processing 2013 let alone having to face 2020. its too much."
3550,"This is what rock bottom looks like. A reverse suicide note, to myself","[The letter to myself](https://imgur.com/a/QiJky9k)

I've been depressed for many years. Over the last year, I've started medicating to a reasonable level of success but I still have my bad days. Last night, during a coke, ketamine and weed binge (all taken while recovering from a hangover) I finally hit the bottom. I've been depressed for so long but for the first time my eyes were open and I realised that I was the one causing all of my problems. My life is only in the state it's in because of choices I've made that got me here

I was so excited to have this new perspective that I wrote myself a sort of reverse suicide note. Saying that instead of wanting to end my life, I finally realised that I wanted to live it. I realised that I need to start making positive choices in my life. I need to start choosing short term discomfort for long term gain and not the opposite. More exercise, eating better, reconnecting with people, stop being such a bummer around people and spreading your negativity

So I'm sharing it with Reddit. Why? I honestly have no idea. Maybe this will help someone else, I don't know. It's also to partly shame myself into sorting my life out. While this is a positive step, I suppose sharing it is my way of trying to make myself more accountable. Although really, the only person I should be accountable to any more is me

Thanks for listening"
3551,Can I ever get it back?,"Depression has robbed me of all feelings of love towards my girlfriend. I've felt myself pulling away from her for months now, but as hard as I fought to hang on to that small but vital piece of myself it seems like it is gone now too. I'm just an empty shell of who I used to be.

I haven't given up yet, I won't let the big sad win. I just don't know if i can pick up the pieces this time or if I have to start all over again."
3552,I can't,"I mean i can't do this anymore, I'm fucking tired of it all. I'm at the point where I don't even care about how my family would react if i kill myself and to be honest that was the only thing from stopping me... idk i just wanna feel okay"
3553,Does psychotherapy actually work?,"It's been a little less than a year that I've started to undertake a psychotherapy with a psychologist. I first wanted to ask for a pill that would pull me out from depressive episodes which I found necessary since the last time I almost shot myself. My therapist then suggested me to follow a long-term psychotherapy rather than just taking the pills on need as it won't ultimately solve the problem. However she still prescribed me some medications I could use ""just in case"" (seroquel, which I chose over a benzodiazepine that could develop a dependence). 

I've been since seeing my therapist once a week, however I don't feel particularly better after a year of psychotherapy and I'm not comfortable with the medications either because sure it does work, but it is highly sedative and I ultimately don't take it when I need to in the fear of having to waste the whole day sleeping.

I'm lucky to have my parents paying off my medical fees but I really don't want to put them under unecessary financial strain, and I'm considering stopping the therapy. Do you think it's still worth continuing the psychotherapy and if you think so, why?"
3554,"Seeing a doctor about my depression, soon, really nervous.","I want to get better, but i'm scared about things like telling too much info or if im described antidepressants, they make me into a zombie or something. I just wanna be naturally happy again, like so many years ago."
3555,"I got laid off, I can’t go back home for Christmas, and I finally got up the courage to ask a boy out that I liked and got shot down.","Like man, I had debilitating depression before this two week horror movie began, but now it’s just awful. And trying to prevent your depression from keeping you in bed vs out there applying to jobs is basically an Olympic sport. Even with just the depression, I felt like the luckiest girl in the world because I was beating it and I was hiking every weekend (because I could afford it) and losing weight and kicking ass at work. But now I just feel like a total failure man."
3556,Am I depressed?,"I am not sure, if I am depressed or not because some of the smyptoms are following me for my whole life.

Like low-esteem, finding it difficult making decisions or having a lot of Anxious feelings.

But for a year or so it is getting worse, I am feeling Hopless and worthless, I have little to none enjoyment in thinks I loved to do and I have no motivation nor energy to do anything.

And the thought of Suicide had a minor present in my head for a longtime but now it feels overwhelming, like a countdown that gets evercloser to the end.

I tried calling the Suicide Hotline to get answers and if i need help and where to find it but I tried it for about an hour and no one picked up.

Now I need your answers.

P S: I am sorry for Grammatical errors, for punctuation errors and Spelling mistakes."
3557,28M and can’t see myself turning 30,"Hello everyone. I just joined this sub and wanted to reach out. Partly because I know you share some of my feeling inherently, and partly because we don’t know each other personally. I don’t expect anyone to read this entire post and I have no idea how long it will end up being.
Just a little back story, as I said I am 28, I will be 29 in March. I have been in a relationship with my wife for 8 years, married for 5, and have a son that just turned 3 this month.

Back in January of this year I got a public intoxication ticket while outside of my apartment smoking a cigarette. My wife does not like drinking, smoking, drug use, or even swearing. She knows I smoke cigarettes and used to be okay with my drinking until it became a bit excessive. I believe I was using alcohol to escape the reality of not being happy. In the beginning of my 9 month probation it appeared that my marriage was ending. My wife had given up trying and I had put her through too much for too long.

Go forward about a month and we are still together, and I believe that she and I are working on improving our relationship. She had communicated some of the reasons she was unhappy and I was trying to give her more time to herself and doing my best to be positive and supportive of her feelings and views.

Forward a bit more and I started taking antidepressants that I was prescribed from my doctor. I start to feel a bit better and life is somewhat easy to get through. At this point I am working two jobs to pay for my probation, counseling, and court costs as my wife said that I could not use our joint account to pay for any of these things. Things between us seem to continue to improve at this point.

I’m a bit embarrassed to admit to you that because my wife had fallen out of love with me, we had had no sexual contact or any type of intimacy for at least a year. I accepted this as I felt we had to work back to it and didn’t expect her to want to do anything with someone she doesn’t love.

Now it’s December. My son just turned three. I was off probation with no issues the day before Thanksgiving and thought that now things could start to be easier for us. At my sons birthday one of my wife’s male friends whom she sees at karaoke every week shows up at my apartment. I didn’t know he was coming and was a bit thrown off by this. My wife knew that I thought something was going on between them earlier in the year so I thought it was a little inconsiderate to not even tell me he was coming.

Now it’s Monday of this past week. I tell her I was uncomfortable with what happened and am basically told well it shouldn’t be a problem. Wednesday comes and as we are eating dinner my wife looks upset so I ask her what’s wrong. She initially says that talking doesn’t help and it doesn’t matter. I pry a little more and ask her to please tell me what’s wrong. She snaps at me and says that she’s still not happy, nothing has changed, I haven’t changed, that I’m rude and inconsiderate.

I felt for the past five months at least that things were getting better and had no reason to think that she was still unhappy and then I’m told this. She always does this where things seem to be getting better for a long time and then she tells me one day that nothing has changed. I told her that I think she needs to talk to somebody and she is possibly depressed too to which she replies that it obviously hasn’t helped me at all.

The next day I notice on Facebook that her and this particular male friend are no longer friends. I question my wife about it and she said that he unfriended her because she told him that I was uncomfortable with them being friends. So obviously between all of this, she talked to him personally which tells me that she talks to him when she’s upset but not me. Am I crazy for thinking this? I had asked to see her phone just to put my mind at ease which I didn’t want to do and felt wrong even asking but it would be the only way to help me with that thought pattern. She says she won’t show me her phone and that I’m crazy and she doesn’t know why I thought she would fall back in love with me right away.

So now basically it seems like there is a divorce coming or at least a separation which means I don’t get so see my son or my wife whom I love very much. My world is falling apart and it’s because I thought things were getting better and I guess they weren’t. Now my wife is going to leave me and be with this friend of hers.

I wrote a suicide note the other day and seriously contemplated it. I’ve called the hotline a few times but it doesn’t seem to help much. I don’t know what to do and I need more help than I thought I guess. I’m afraid to die but so badly want to. I don’t want to leave my son but don’t know if I’m even a good person to have him learn from. If he learns to act like me he will not be very well off. I feel my days are numbered and just want my wife to hug me and tell me we will get through it together like she did on our wedding day.

Thank you for reading my very long story. It has been therapeutic in a way to write this down. If you have any advice that may be helpful feel free to share but please be nice. I love you all"
3558,My antidepressant has made me dumb. Can anyone relate?,"I feel as if my antidepressant has made me dumb. I have trouble forming thoughts, communicating with people, and chatting with people online. I feel less intelligent now than I was before using antidepressant. I have stopped using antidepressant for 6 months but I still feel this way.

Can anybody relate?"
3559,My depression keeps driving people I love away...I just want to be happy and be fixed...,"So I’ve been trying to start over with my ex bf and I thought it was going good but I felt like I was messing up because I was too shy and sad all the time...but I finally worked up the courage to tell him how I really feel then he walked up to me in person and told me “I can’t do this anymore”

Turns out he was trying to force himself to like me and try to make the relationship work. He didn’t need to do that at all he should of told me the first time that he didn’t want to go do it..but he’s a really nice guy and wanted to be nice and try to make me happy and not want to hurt me...I feel like I’ve been lied to...I don’t want to be pitted...I’ve been hurt all my life pain never seems to go away...all I wanted was honesty and I thought he forgave me for what happened in the past and moved on but he said it still hurts him..why did I think I could fix the relationship..? I feel so stupid and weak! Just when I think things are finally coming around that I can finally fix my life and put it Back together it backfires..!? 

He said it was hard for him to try and love me like he did in the past...and he’s right because of my depression I’ve changed...I’m not the happy and socialized girl he fell in loved with before...and because of it I’ve ruined everything...everything is my fault..

I said I understood and then walked to my car and called my friend to tell her what happened..I burst into tears when I got in...I just want help...I just wanted to be happy and feel like myself again..my depression keeps ruining everything! And I can’t get a therapist because my parents don’t believe I have depression...I just want my life back...😢"
3560,"It was a rough night, and I don’t have any headphones","Spent most of it laying in bed feeling shitty. No headphones to listen to music, don’t want to wake my roommate. 

It feels like every day is spent feeling either miserable or completely numb. It’s no way to live. And I don’t want to live this way. I don’t really want to live much at all. 

I dropped out of college last year. Got a restaurant job for a few months. Hated it, so I quit about 3 months ago. Since then I’ve just been doing nothing. It feels like nothing matters. There’s no drive, or passion, or anything anymore. 

Why should I bother living if none of it is good? I’m tired of having to put on a face for people. I don’t even care enough to try to get better. No one gives a shit. This place sucks. Hope you have a good day if you read this shit"
3561,"I wasted my 18 years on the earth, broke trust of my parents, wasted their money, I'm just a coward, I wish I could sleep and never wake up.",
3562,"I'm so close to finishing something, but I feel like quitting","I hate feeling this way. I don't know why I feel this way. I am doing well in what I'm trying to accomplish, and the end is near, but I just feel so unmotivated and lost. I keep going but I feel like quitting... I try to think back on ""why"" I started, but I feel I've lost touch with it. 
I know I will regret every moment of my life if I quit now, which is what is forcing me to keep on going.
I have anxiety about it all the time, I can't sleep a full night because of it. Part of it I think it's my depression and my desire to be back at home alone where I feel most comfortable. I just felt like getting this off my chest for some reason.. 

Thank you for reading."
3563,Going out of my mind 🤯,"Hello burnout, nice to see you again. Relationship troubles, no money, losing my health, job, car and house soon. Not even sure I can keep my therapy dog. Everything feels hopeless and I'm about to do something reckless and regrettable. I need change, please. Feels like suffocating. Doing nothing is all my brain will let me do, just watch it all crumble. I don't even know what TO do. Every move feels like the wrong one. I'm tired of hurting people and begin hurt. I just can't take it anymore"
3564,The Struggle of Human Existence,"I wrote a thing, and don't really know where else to put it. Sometimes writing it all out just helps. 

...

It's hard to describe what it's like in here.

My world is shattering into pieces. Usually when people use that expression it's as a metaphor, to say their life is not going so well, and things are unpleasant. But when I say my world is shattering... I mean I really can feel each shard. I look up into the sky and it shifts and moves, flickers in and out of existence as it gets cut between flashes of faces, flashes of memories that were never real, violence I've never experienced yet seems all so vivid. I continue walking down the street on autopilot, as I feel the weight of that sky fall down on my shoulders like I'm suddenly stuck at the bottom of the ocean, under the pressure of the whole world itself. I desperately try to regain control, remind myself who I am and what matters, but that just makes it worse. I arrive at my destination, and the chaos moves into my shadow. Right behind me, waiting for me to lose my focus and come back to its world. 

And then sometimes, things are okay. I can see things as they are, I know that simple every day actions won't have drastic world ending consequences, and I can function. But this world is flat. I still smile, laugh, react in the ways I should, but it feels wrong. Behind all of that, the puppet-master pulling the strings, there is a broken figure. They have wild eyes, a wide smile, and a confidence which says they know full well that they are in control. And I am not. The world is okay, I can feel as I should, but waiting for me underneath it all is this evil, shadowy emptiness, just waiting for me to slip up. To spend one moment looking inward, one moment without focus, to remind me that all of this is for nothing. That in the end, I know where my deathbed lays. I know this won't last.

I constantly debate whether this chaos is a natural part of being human, or if the ever growing pile of issues and pain was purely bad luck, a terrible combination of unfortunate genetics and circumstance culminating in a life doomed to fail. On the one hand, if this is normal, that means I can beat it. Suck it up, and grow stronger. That would also support my theory that we're all actually in hell, being tortured with just enough issues to keep us struggling but never enough to truly, truly end things. The main point for this theory is that it would mean I can beat this. It makes the monster vulnerable because others have done this too, gives proof to the idea that this can end. On the other hand, if this truly is just bad luck. No control, nothing that could have been done to prevent it. I was born with a twin no one could see, a companion growing inside me learning to tear me apart piece by piece like a tumour, slowly sucking out my life. That would mean I already know how this ends. Regardless of which theory is correct, there is no magic pill. There is no drug, no therapy, no words of wisdom that will take this away. The best I can ever hope for is to learn how to balance the weight of this world, make exactly the right movements and say exactly the right things to keep it from all toppling down again. If there really is no choice to this, and I really am just a lit stick of dynamite with a wick no one can see to say how long or short it may be, the result will always be an explosion. Whether that be now or in twenty years, entropy will always take it's course. What goes up must come down, this weight will topple, that wick will burn and this all will end. 

But even amongst all of this. I like petting animals. I like the smiles on children's faces. I like cold days, snuggled up in blankets. I like the shape of my partner's hand in mine. I like chocolate. I like the beach after the sun has gone down, when no one is left to crowd it. I like seeing the stars, the sky, the shapes and colours of the world. The smell of coffee in the morning. The colour blue. I like the softness of stuffed animals. The comfort of a bed after a day of hard work. The feel of paint and pen being put on paper by my hand, my tiny, insignificant marks on the world. 

These things make us human. And regardless of the chaos in my mind, these things will remain. The sky itself may fall, the demons in my head may never leave. Maybe I die old, or maybe I die at their hands. Whichever way I go, however my future looks, I will have lived. There will be people who remember me, even if only as a face they saw once, or that person who never really spoke, and sort of just stared at nothing all the time. I was here. I have to remember that as far into myself as I may fall, I exist. I am real. 

I will scream at this brick wall until my lungs have no more air. I will shout into the void, even if the real world never hears a sound. I will cover myself in permanent marks of passion, of artwork, of life itself to build myself into something greater, because in the end it will all be gone.

The fire burns, my skin falls away. 
The fight is meaningless. No one wins.

I will not fall to the ashes silently. 

Even if not a living soul hears me, this world will know my name."
3565,My existence is a contradiction.,"I'm not sure if this is a common thought pattern: Much of my depression comes from a kind of dissonance between my personal self and my social self. I'll be personally satisfied, and then the expectations from my family, friends, school, or general society shatter that brief period of self-contentment. Conversely, situations that expect that kind of satisfaction often see me being quite the opposite; when (my *perception* of) everyone else's satisfaction is higher than my own, all I want to do is crawl into a hole and actually die.

The last time I went to a therapist, we both agreed that I'm—more or less—a ""man without a country."" I'm constantly drifting in and out of society, seemingly always at *exactly* the wrong time. 

Is this just my life?"
3566,Did anyone start smoking because if loneliness?,"Apart from being a stress relief from the daily life it actually helped me become more social, to have just something in common with other people. 
I know it's bad for my health, considering I'm also asthmatic, but at least it helped me to get out of my shell a little more and get an excuse to interact with people..."

3570,I appreciate all of you,"Everything makes me depressed. I’ve been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember but I was never really sure if I could actually call it that or just feeling sorry for myself. Is it actual depression or just pity. I’ve always felt like I’m too aware and I see things as they truly are and it causes me to have an existential crisis. It’s a curse really. 

I could never really relate to anyone in my immediate or extended family which angers me and makes me feel lonely. But not only do I get angry at my family at times I also get angry at myself BECAUSE I get angry at them. I appear moody and lash out which makes me feel like total crap. My parents, if I’m being brutally honest, are partly to blame and my mom knows that but it makes me feel SO guilty. I try to hide it as much as I can though I feel like it exacerbates my depression. My dad on the other hand has always been a pretty cheerful guy. I would say he pretty much lives by “ignorance is bliss”. It pains me because I feel horrible for him to have me a son. We have some things in common like the same taste in music and movies for the most part but not much other than that. Perhaps the reason why I watch a lot of movies with him is my attempt to connect with him. I’m sure he has an idea of my depression but I’ve never really talked with him about it and it makes me feel horrible because he doesn’t really understand the full extent of depression and has a much simpler outlook in life by saying “you can’t take life too seriously. You just gotta take it easy and be happy.” If only it were that simple. But I don’t see myself working up the courage to eventually tell him what a cowardly son he has anytime soon. 

I began seeing a psychiatrist this summer but recently I started feeling like they don’t actually care.  Some are just looking for a paycheck. I will admit however it helped a bit with my uncertainty. In a strange way, knowing and being diagnosed with clinical depression was a reassurance. Finding this sub helped a lot too. I read some of the posts on here and I, too, think “I’m too aware”, “Why can’t I simply be happy?”, and “Is my life depressing or do I just want it to be?” etc. etc. Without my psychiatrist and this sub, I would’ve lived in uncomfortable uncertainty. 

There’s a lot more I could say but I don’t want to ramble on and type too much. I think I’ve accepted and am ready to live the rest of my life the way it is now. Introverted, lonely, being a loser/coward, depressed.

The reason I’m writing this is to thank all of you :) and try to get some of this off my chest. I appreciate the people in this sub and their courage. Even though some of you don’t see it without you I wouldn’t have had the strength to do this."
3571,"Someone please hear me out, I just want someone to listen","These bad feelings that have been rooted into my soul have been hurting me for quite some time, and have only now made themselves more visible, more loud, more present.

Sometimes even the smallest things will upset me, make me feel worthless or a burden or that no one will miss me if I die.

Sometimes late at night I cry, I cry because I’m so tired of being alive and feeling like no one understands. I’ll try to look up online chat rooms for Suicide prevention just so I can talk to someone. Ill wonder if I should drive myself to a hospital. But I’ll feel like a burden on my friends and family, if they know how bad it’s gotten if they know I can’t take it anymore, if they know that I’m falling apart. That I’m too much for them.

And at the same time, I’m feeling so alone and sad and I can’t take it. I want someone to tell me it’s ok, and tell me I’m good, and I’m good enough and I’m not a failure and I deserve to live.
I feel like I’m slowly dying on the inside, and I really really just want someone to be there and I don’t know who to go to. 
I’m scared of  myself. One day I think I’m gonna be pushed to the limit and I slit my throat or swallow pills. 
 Right now I’m trying to fall asleep but I’m so angry and sad that I can’t, and then I wake up in the morning so tired and exhausted and I feel like I don’t know how I’m gonna get through the day, and then sometimes I barely eat or eat too much, and then at the end of the day I’m back to being sad and lonely and crying and wondering if I should die or not feeling hopeless.
I’m just really sad and I’m tired of all this. I wanna be happy and I can’t seem to reach happiness"
3572,Hating my body,"Does anyone else here feel disgusting about themselves and their bodies? I hate mine so much, I cut it. I hate my female body but I don't want a male body either. It's more I want to have a robot body. A pratical body. No pain, no guts, no nothing
I know... It's stupid..."

3574,Is it normal to question if you actually have depression,"When I first found out i had depression I questioned if I actually had it. I had the mine set “life could be worse” so I thought I was being dramatic or just wanted attention and I hated my self for getting depressed and even sad because I thought I didn’t have a reason to be depressed. 
I have serval and smiling depression and I still will question it till this day."
3575,Why am I feeling so sad if everything is going fine?,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post.
I just recently graduated high school and got a job (as a cashier) it's a decent job, average pay, helpful and kind coworkers, and I'm doing fine there. But for some reason, ever since I started, I just feel sad. No particular reason, I just feel an indescribable emptiness. It's not the fact the I have a job, I've done work experience before in the Entertainment Industry and I loved it. But I feel like I'm only here for the money. I just randomly started weeping in bed silently so I don't alert my family, and I keep asking myself, 'why are you crying?' And I can't even answer myself. I want to quit, because I think this isn't the place for me, but I don't want my parents to be disappointed in me for quiting, or if my friends hear about it their probably going to say that I haven't even been there for long and that it's easy. I honestly just want to feel normal again.

Anyway, sorry if this seemed too 'light' for this sub, I just really wanted to share what I was feeling."
3576,how to stop being a piece of shit?,"i fucked all of highschool. struggled every day to get out of bed and one day just stopped attending. it's been a couple months. only my mother knows but i haven't had it in me to tell anyone else, they still think im attending and currently sitting exams. i have a great boyfriend, and im fucking it up with him too because i fucking hate all of me so badly that I can't meet his family. fucking up our intimicy as well because i hate my body so badly that i cant fully undress. haven't left my room in a good 3 weeks. shaking because of how bad my diet is. replacing meals with absolute shit constantly. gaining weight and only hating myself more. repulsed is a cute name to express how i feel about myself. can't think of a word strong enough to describe how disgusted i am by every aspect of myself. currently looking for a job but im still absolutely terrified that i still wont have it in me to get out of bed. im a worthless piece of shit that doesn't deserve a boyfriend or family like the one i have. all i do is place a burden on them and it's so easy to see. how the fuck do i live life like this? struggling by barely? am i even coping at this point? I can't even muster up the courage to go outside. a friend is coming over today and im shaking just thinking about how she's going to see me at my worst. a fat disgusting mess. how? how can i do this? how do i stop being so repulsed by everything about me? ive gained weight to the point where im almost 60kg and god i feel revolting. how do i go on like this feeling like i bring nothing to anyones life? i can't even kill myself because that'll just bring misery to them too. I'm just totally fucked and i don't see where to go from here or any way to make it better. i just want it to fucking end"
3577,I wish I had no emotions,"They're not worth it when you live in hopeless misery 99% of the time for no valid reason. The 1% of times in life where I feel anything other than it is no longer worth it, I wish I could kill off my feelings."
3578,"Just got rejected by someone close to me, I realize no one can ever love me the way I want to be and I want to die.","Im writing this right now because I have no other outlet to share for advice. My existence has been nothing but rejection by every person that was ever important to me because they couldn’t want me no matter how sweet or understanding I was to them. Throughout my time alive, each time I attempted to be close and intimate with someone it ended with me caring so much about them only for the person to not have same care for me. The person I cared about romantically I got to know over a long time, we had a strong connection but they rejected me because they said they couldn’t want me the way I wanted them to. Im at a breaking point because I honestly believe no one can ever want me the way I want them physically and emotionally. There is nothing wrong with me physically, I am attractive, I take care of myself and try to be a kind and genuine person at all times yet Im still rejected by the people I care about no matter how many times I manage to open up to and it makes me not want to live anymore . What is the point of building any relationship if the person you want cannot love and want you for all you are the same way."
3579,I Think I Just Want To Quit,"Don't really feel like I'm cut out for this life thing.  


I'm 30 years old, I have a dead-end job with very little career prospects, I have no savings but I have debt, have very few friends and don't feel comfortable in heavily social situations.  


Worst of all whilst the rest of the people around me are all getting married, developing careers and starting families, I'm stuck where I have been for the last couple years with nothing to show for it  


I take anti-depressants and see a mental counseller regularly, but I still fight with whatever's in my head constantly.   


I'm at the point where I am tired, I am frustrated. I really try to make this work, but I can't help but feel like I'm just not supposed to be here. The only thing that has stopped me is the hurt it would cause my family, but sometimes even that doesn't feel like enough"
3580,Do not underestimate overcatastrohpizing,"What a crazy rollercoaster of a day.  


I woke up late into the day today to read an email from my freelance website that the client that I was working with has canceled the task, I was freaking out because I thought I fucked up (yet again) and I was relying on the money to pay rent. I was in a very negative space and I feel like the only reason  I am okay is because of my religious beliefs about an afterlife. I somehow got out of that headspace and started looking for work, lo and behold I was able to score 2 new commissions and the best part is I just received an email from the client( whom I thought canceled the task) saying that she did not request the cancellation and that she is happy to continue working with me.  


This whole ordeal has taught me a good lesson about over catastrophizing and I hope you get the same message from it."
3581,just venting I guess,"What the hell happened to me. After a very bad depressive episode a couple of years ago where I would have killed myself if it wasn't for my cat, I completely changed my lifestyle, stopped smoking, started exercising and eating healthy. I had a job in which within 5 years I achieved what others need 10+ years for. I had a boyfriend for whom I've left everyone else behind because we couldn't be kept apart. Not that I regretted it, I haven't been close to many people anyway. I felt great, I felt strong, I was doing fine.

Recently I unraveled again, my relationship is falling apart because of me, I can't be bothered to put any effort into my job and I have nothing that I really care for (except for the cats again, now there's two of them). I stopped going out because I can't bear being around other people. I stopped working out, I eat like shit and drink way too much. And I can't stop because I have no reason to. I don't know what I'm writing this for, but there it is, I'll delete it in 5 minutes because I'll be ashamed of myself. If anyone reads it, I hope you are feeling better than me."
3582,An interesting title.,"I came very close to committing suicide back in 2017. I wrote a dumb little note just willing my belongings to my family. And I walked down to a creek. My Hope's were to slice my throat and hit a artery then drift away. As I sat there along the bed of water. I contemplated everything. All of my life that I had lived up until that point. The places I've been the people I've met. I thought about how in my rough childhood I didn't think I'd ever survive until adult hood. I thought about all the girls I'd been with.  The significant relationships and bonds I've made. Ones that other people have a very hard time making. That just come easily to me. I thought and asked myself were the issues in my life at that point so irreversible that killing myself would be a better option? I reminded myself just how many times I've beaten the odds before. How many times I'd survived suicide attempts before. Surely they must mean something? Surely there was a reason I didn't die. Some distant thing I was meant to do in the unforeseen future. So mentally I cataloged all the things I didn't like in my life at that moment. And I told myself I'd give myself a year to change them all. And if by then I'd still felt the same way, still felt like an heroing. Then, then I'd do it. 

And I did. I had changed so much in my life. I got off social security. Knowing that lazying about all day collecting government checks was only hurting my ego. Because for me there's no sense of accomplishment in that. There's also no hope in ever bettering my life to one of luxury. Because the amount of money they give is hardly sustainable. I told myself I'd lose weight. And I did. I started working out and eating better. I haven't lost nearly as much as I'd wanted. But I have lost some. And it's a start. I told myself Id quit trying to find happiness in the bottom of a bottle. I was drinking so much back then. Days just melted away into one big depressed blur. And towards the end there I hated it. I hated drinking and being drunk and god, the hang overs. I don't miss them either.  I wasn't even doing anything fun with the drunk. No parties or celebrations. Just liquor, being alone and crying  or puking myself to sleep. So I quit that. I also quit smoking. For the same reason I quit drinking. I despised that I was doing it. It didn't even make me feel better anymore. I still had the same empty feeling I did after. So what's the point? Ya know?  

So now I'm a healthier me, I have a real job. I'm looking into going to school and my life has significantly changed. But I still feel the same emptiness I did before. And now I feel sort of silly for thinking such changes could have made that different. This realization has put me into a downward spiral. So I said 'fuck it"".  And got drunk the other day, and I started smoking again. But as I had already realized it didn't help. It didn't help that I feel so disconnected from everyone. Like I have friends, and people that care for me. But I just feel so numb to it all. I can't talk to half of the people in my life  like this cause they dont know wtf to say or just ignore it. And the other half I have to be strong for and I can't be weak for the people I'm trying to be strong for. But god, I'm falling to pieces.  These days I can't even find the will to leave my bed. Normally things like work would help me forget just how sad I am. But I can't seem to shake it. And now I can't even look back and cheer myself up with my accomplishments cause I relapsed. Granted I don't want to start my old habits up again. But it doesn't matter anyways because it feels like no matter what I do. Good or bad there's this empty abyss inside of me, that I have to consistently battle. Idk. I'll definitely delete this later. My life is at a point where I am dealing with a lot so perhaps that's why this internal struggle is so hard at the moment. I guess the point of this post is a symbolic way of attempting to get it out. Of sending deep into the ether."
3583,I’m scared that I feel nothing,"I remember feeling sadness and pain every freaking day. Constantly feeling that tightness in my chest, randomly bursting into tears, crying in the shower where no one can see me. It really really sucks. 

Then it came to a point where I just started not feeling anything at all. No motivation, no enjoyment, nothing. I just became this numb, empty shell. I honestly think that numbness scares me the most."
3584,Me vs Stoicism,"I hate it when people think I could force my way through depression. What the fuck? I wanna rest for fuck's sake, I'm tired and my thought on bed is how life would've been better if I was not here. I guess that they have learned to shut down their self awareness or never experienced pain before, I hate stoicism, it forces us to ""make rational decision"" to no end. Every time I do that I feel like I am gassing out my energy which is already thin, tired of this meaningless life."
3585,Being back in a place with a lot of hard memories.,"I'm back where I met a girl that I fell in love with a long time ago. We dated for two years and it was beautiful, but we had to go to different universities. We agreed to keep dating though, we really wanted to make it work.

A week later she called me and told me she'd met someone in her psych class that she really liked, and she didn't believe we could work out.

Hit me like a truck. That was almost 3 years ago and I still feel the effects of it today. I've been back into dating and all, and I've moved on from her, but I still feel depressed because of just all those hard feelings hitting me, and they left quite a mark.

I also had a really close friend here, truly one of the best people I've ever known. We had a humongous fight a long time ago though, and we haven't spoken since. 

I came here because it's like a home away from home for me, but now I can't wait until Monday when I leave. So many hard memories for me here. I'm going to try and make the most of it though, can't let these feelings control me.

Hope y'all have a great weekend, stay positive out there :)"

3587,drug use??,things have been really bad recently and i’ve been thinking about turning to drug use as a form of relief but i know it would ruin my relationship with my boyfriend and risk my mums job so i’m very against it but it would be nice to stop thinking.
3588,What were the best things you did/changed/implemented that improved your life when you were at your lowest ?,"I've hit a point where things just don't seem worth it anymore. Not to seem ungrateful, it's been the most turbulent year to be honest became best friends with an amazing human and things do seem like they're looking up but old depression neurotic habits die fucking hard.
Appreciate the help amazing Reddit humans"
3589,Why is getting over someone so hard?,"It wasn't even that long but it's been over a year and I still can't get over her. I still remember the first time she said I love you. I'd do anything to even start talking again. Just to have that friendship back, I need to see her. Whenever I think I start liking someone she pops up in my mind and I just can't think about anything else. It's starting to get worse and I can't deal with it. She was the best person I have ever met. She was always there for me and just great to talk to. She was so beautiful."

I just can't handle life anymore...  
I'm tired. I'm not cut out for this. Everything I do just ruins everything. I feel like I don't deserve to be happy and I will never be happy.

3593,"My mom is constantly yelling at me for anything. She doesn't allow me to go out, she yells at me for everything i do, she always takes away my phone, internet, any social life i have.","Hey guys. This is getting outta hand. My mom yells at me for everything. I want to go out, she doesn't let me go (social life ruined), I want to have fun online or chill with online friends, she starts yelling at me for loudly typing on my keyboard and always being on my PC. For example, last night i was being on my PC, she tells me to shut it down and go to sleep. I said : ""in a minute"", she starts yelling at me. I start shutting it down, but since it's older, it takes a while, she yells at me. She tells me to make my bed and get ready for sleep. I start getting the bed ready and all that, she still yells at me to do it. I start yelling back at her "" IM ALREADY GETTING THE BED READY, STOP YELLING AY ME"", she starts yelling for me to stop yelling lol. And the irony is that she spends way more time on her phone, being on Facebook and posting pictures of her ""perfect"" life. And now, because I yelled at her last night, she's threatening me to take away my phone and technology. I mean JESUS CHRIST, she starts bringing negative vibes, and then it's my fault for just doing anything in life. I don't have a damn childhood, nothing. She doesn't let me go out, be on my PC, be on my phone, Wtf am I supposed to do ?! She just yells at me and keeps repeating the same things ""go eat, GO EAT, GO EAT PETER !"" ""I SAID, GO EAAAAAAT !"" Like I'm a damn robot. And that happens every day, dozens of time. Im losing myself, I can't do anything i love. It's always about school, but she doesn't understand that if she stopped yelling, I'd be a amazing kid that studies well and has a social life. And if I by any chance tell her that, she denies it, and continues to yell, and tell me how I'm a stupid worthless kid who just sits around the whole DAY and does nothing. Please help me people, I can't do this anymore. I don't want to waste my life. I'm a diabetic also. Im different from other people, I was bullied my whole childhood and now THIS . I don't want to waste my life, my strength. I want to get out of this hell."
3594,growing up is scary,"from the title, you can probably tell I’m still a teenager. i’m around 16, younger or older, that’s up for you to decide. 

currently i work 30 hours a week, although i occasionally work 40. i love my job, it’s as a waitress in the center of town. i enjoy interacting with customers from across the world or even just the lonely regulars. i find solace in strangers’ stories. 

but i fear growing up. i have so much flexibility in my job, they allow me to miss an entire week with no word in advance and i won’t get in trouble for it. but it scares me that one day i’ll finally need to pursue something more. that one day, i can’t make up some excuse that i have a lot of tests just because i’m feeling to close to overdosing again. 

i don’t want to grow up. but i do want to get better. i just don’t know how right now."
3595,How do you know if someone is depressed?,"I don't want to diagnose myself to have depression but i think i've been there. There's time that i'm so stress and just wanna run away from everything and get to the point of chocking myself using my necktie for school. I've been in countless breakdown too crying and shaking but i don't know the reason but time pass i think im okay now i've been positive lately and that's good but my brother...


I think he's stressing himself lately since my parents keep scolding him about his grades. My parents are actually good and don't care about how high our grades are but my brother grades are so low that's why they think they need to get in action. 

My bro is a happy person I'm not saying that he's happy outside but not inside. He's really happy. I remember his weird jokes, telling story about school, singing weirdly, and blasting anime songs in our house. While I'm the sh*t 'depress' person who has a fake smile and cry every night, listen to music that I think I relate to but like in uno he slap me with reverse card. I'm happy but I think he's not. He rarely go outside his room and I can hear someone sad music he's listening too he talks about rappers that die (how they die) and he rarely smile now. I see him like what am I in the past. He's blasting music about leaving this world while I'm playing Jojo op. I think too that our parents are pressuring him too much and he can't handle it anymore. He's really stress about this. 

And I fkn hate it. I don't want him to go to the stage he cannot climb up again but I'm not really sure if he's really stress that he's about to be depressed. So I want to know if he's falling into that state. 


And the thing is while writing this he suddenly come to me so I stop writing. He hug me tightly without saying a word and left. He just rarely did that since both of us are not close anymore. I'm really concern right now."
3596,This is all fucking pointless. It can't get better.,"I'm probably going to kill myself soon. I don't really want to die but I don't know any other way to stop hurting. My narssistic mother pulled me out of school when I came out as trans. It's been over 2 years since I've talked to anyone even close to my age. I have lost almost all of my social skills so even if I try to move out, go to school, get a job, etc. I will have no idea how to interact with the real world. I have no car( I wasn't allowed to get my permit until I was 17) and no one in my family is willing to drive me to take my G.E.D so even if I wanted to move out I can't because most jobs require you to be finished with high school. This situation is never going to get better and I'm fucking tired of people telling me it will. I have no good reason to continue dealing with this bullshit. I don't have anyone to live for anyway."
3597,I can't concentrate or remember stuff....,"I'm in final year of college and I have exams day after tomorrow I can't sit in one place and study, if I open the book I get all these unnecessary thoughts from my childhood Wich makes me cringe, if I put earphones and play white noise I can't concentrate properly, I've had major depression since past 3 years and I've barley passed in subjects, I'm currently having a mental breakdown thinking about my future, I don't know what to do :("
3598,What is your experience with antidepressants?,"I have depression and social anxiety. I'm 27.

I'm about to get a job even though I hate working and the thought of full-time job depresses me. This is a job that will let me move to the country I want, my boyfriend's country, and I hate my living situation right now (I live with a parent) and I really want and need to move. But this job is also a job that requires me to always rely on my co-workers to ride a taxi together because the country isn't that safe etc, so I would always have to talk with them and they also party a lot after work apparently.

As my anxiety got better from therapy, while exposing myself to situations that challenges my anxiety I've realized that I'm just pretending to be someone in not. Sometimes I don't want to talk with people just because I don't want, not always because I'm anxious, but because I have an introverted personality.

It's like society demands me to act extroverted if I want to go somewhere in life. Always have to be social at work, in meetings, with my family, with my bfs family(those times I visited him it demanded a lot from me as they are always socializing and they are also noisy people). 

Being around noisy extroverted people exhaust me even when I'm not anxious. Even though I want this job, I want friends, I want to move, I just can't seem to keep up with what life demands from me to do all of that, and then depression seems to hit me worse.

My plan is now to consult my doctor about  antidepressants to manage to keep up and have the life I want. My problem is partly my depression, partly my anxiety and partly my personality. Could anti depressants help with this? What are your experiences with anti depressants? Did they affect your energy levels, did they affect your personality?"
3599,"I just got called a lie, and I’ve never heard anything farther from the truth","My gf is drunk and she starts going on like ‘you dont even like me’ and shit like that and i reply with ‘i so do thats a lie’. She replies with ‘you’re a lie’

And while she may be drunk and i dont know if she means what she says, but that really punched me in the gut. I thought about it, and i relate to it. I am a lie, everything i do is a lie. Im not real, nothing i do is real."
3600,2019: My Review,"Literal shit. I got my dream job in April then 'laid off' today. My mom died three days BEFORE Halloween (my fave holiday) and almost one year after she was diagnosed with throat cancer (which was completely gone as of last test in May 2019) She had no signs of being 'sick' but she had a massive stroke followed by an aneurysm where she was declared brain dead. I took her off life support, she took three deep breaths and she was gone. I've got my dog and my hamster. That's it. I've got 'family' but they haven't been around until she died so they really don't give a fuck. Basically, I've got nothing. If it wasn't for my dog, I would have already killed myself. It is getting harder and harder to get out of the bed. So, 2019 can get fucked."
3601,"I drove home kind or drunk, feeling guilty and upset with myself.","Idk if this is the right place to post this but I drove home drunk tonight. I got into an argument with my girlfriend and I just stormed out the door and drove 15 minutes home in icy conditions, my vision was clear but I know I wasn't sober, right now I'm feeling really guilty and upset cause I not only put myself at risk but also put other drivers and pedestrians at risk. Idk I'm still not sober right now that's probably why I'm so upset and posting it here. I shouldn't have done that."

3603,Christmas Blues,"Anyone else going through it as well? Can't even sleep these days, people don't even care about decorating their home. I get sad when I pass by a house and all I see is a living room with the light slightly on and the dead silence. No decorations, no people, no laughing, no music, just quiet. I assumed everyone would be hyped about entering a new decade and to see the year go out like this is depressing. What does it take to be happy in this lifetime?"
3604,Food tastes grey,"What sucks the most about depression is that life's simple pleasures are ripped away from you as you sink lower.
I used to love food, I liked pasta, and ice cream and pizza and strawberries and spinach.
But now, I barely have the energy to even think about food. When I can muster up any sort of appetite it feels like I'm eating to live, not to enjoy. No matter what I eat, it just tastes like grey."
3605,how to be happy without alcohol,"I'm currently facing that problem that I can't feel anything, except when I drink alcohol.

like I can't even be sad. when I'm sober I'm just completly empty, not even sad I'm just empty. I wish I could be sad, but I just don't feel anything.

my whole life consists of waiting for the weekend so I can get drunk and while I know it's not good to get wasted every weekend, I don't know how to change it.

I'm a piece of shit. I wish I could meet a girl that loves me, but I'm such a big piece of shit I don't think I will ever meet someone who truly cares about me.

i hate myself"
3606,In a serious need of motivation.,Today I have to go to my works christmas party. Out of all days today is the day I feel so damn low again. I have to shower but I just can't bring myself to do it. I really want to wrap myself in a blanket and not do anything. If I don't go I'll get so much shit for it and they will accuse me of ruining the party and everyones mood (it's just a small group having a christmas party). If I  go and don't drink and don't really participate in games and other activities I'll get shit again for ruining everything. Why can't I just disappear for few days!!
3607,Anyone else put people on pedestals too often?,"
I certainly do. And I don’t mean it as in I see a very beautiful woman and decide she is way too out of my league( tho this happens quite often haha)

I mean it as in... genuine admiration for their traits.This guy I know? He is one of the kindest people I have observed from afar. Nice to me too, of course. He is an extremely talented artist and also quite handsome (unique features) with a very attractive body that makes the ladies stare and giggle(happened at a pool our group went to when he took his shirt off, no exaggeration). 

It’s like- I see him as this awesome figure... and I want to be his friend, not just a guy he knows. But at the same time I am not worthy of his presence...? He’s just too good. I’m just a depressed loser in comparison. 

This girl I know at school? She’s very high EQ, very, very charismatic without being cocky. She knows a huge range of wordly topics and can match her conversation to whomever she is talking to...and they all end up wanting to be her friend, it’s insane. 
Again, I want to become her friend. (No, I don’t wanna get in her pants lol). But again... she is too good for me. I am nothing. I am undeserving, a self obsessed loser guy with zero social skills. 

Maybe if I had the courage to see these people as people...with flaws and all like me I could approach them. But... I see them as waaaayyy above me. So I go back into my depressed, self sabotaging mind :(  I can’t fix it. I dunno how!"
3608,I just got fired,"I was at university last year, had to drop out due to suicidal thoughts and isolation.


I got an apprenticeship as a teaching assistant for 3 months, but had to quit due to a suicide attempt.


Got a job working on a farm but they don't offer work for me in the winter so I lost that job.


Finally got myself a real job, I was a postman for royal mail. I loved it, was a perfect job for me. I had one absence a few weeks ago due to illness, and one absence yesterday due to migraines.


I just got told today that I'm fired. Apparently during training if I have more than one absence I loose the job.


I was not told this by anyone the whole 3-4 months I've been working here, I've been told by 6 different postmen I've been working with that I am allowed 3 days illness and after that I only get a warning.


But this is it now, I'm done. They told me that I could just go home now, as a trainee I dint have to sign anything. I'm finished there.


I feel so fed up with this. I don't know what to do now. I'm just feeling completely lost."
3609,Oh boy it’s anxiety time!,"I was driving home today with the feeling of my skin trying to crawl off my body. Having a casual conversation with my 5 year old, as I try and figure out why my anxiety is through the roof today. Then it hit me. My depression MUST be getting better! Until now I haven’t had the energy to be anxious. 

I feel broken that this is an actual thought and somehow a reason to celebrate."
3610,Curious if this is the right place.,"Hey everyone! 
Just after some opinions and sorry if I should know better not to!

I feel I have had my fair share of mental battles (depression, psychosis, drug addiction, Tourettes) and definitely not saying I have it the worst, I know people have and are going through so much more than I could ever imagine, hence why I am writing this. 

I feel I have learnt some pretty effective tips, tricks and copping mechanisms that some people could maybe really benefit from. 

I’ve always wanted to help people and feel it’s what I’m put on this earth to do.

So here is what I want to do, and I know sometimes reddit isn’t too fond of this...
I want to make YouTube videos.. I know, gross haha.
I feel it’s the best way to fully explain things and reach as many people as possible. 
I feel people will be able to relate to me because I wouldn’t be like a typical suit and tie counsellor that hasn’t even experienced what we all have been through. 
I do have tattoos which does seem to make people weary of me, but once I have a quick convo with someone I feel that become a lot more relax and comfortable with me and open up easier.

So my question is, would anyone be interested if I posted some of my videos here? 
Or is that a stupid question and I shouldn’t have even asked it on reddit, haha.

Please be kind and don’t roast me too much, or do, I understand haha.

Thanks people!


( I am in two other r/ communities similar to this one, so I’m going to copy and paste it on there to and get their opinions as well. Just so you know I’m not spamming every r/ I can find)"
3611,Is it better to tell people you're planning on killing yourself?,"Not sure if I should just be up front and honest. At least then the people I do tell will know they couldn't have done anything about it. Im gonna wait till after xmas though cos I dont wanna ruin it. Im not looking for advice or help, apart from answering the question in the title. Thanks."
3612,I miss feeling loved,No one will ever truly want me. I have very little to offer someone. I just feel so lost and unloveable. I’m such a failure in everything I do.
3613,"Trapped, monotonous hell. Stuck living with ex","I feel a little silly posting this, as I know people have things a lot worse, and a lot harder than me. However, I just needed somewhere to vent, put down and air how I feel and how I'm struggling. My life just feels like its crushing me, and it's a slow wearing down and suffocating feeling that causes me physical breathing and chest pain issues sometimes.



My ex broke up with me about a year ago, at the time I was a mess, tried to make things work and I went back on my old meds again for depression as I felt really low. We had only bought a house together 2 years prior, and been together 9 years.

Now as I look back, I dont miss the relationship, as honestly I dont think it was working and I was just upset at the change and everything was just comfy. I'd always been the one who gave up the parts of my life and me to make her happy, maybe that's why I was getting into a rut. She has 2 kids, both girls and late teens now, I have no kids, and settled on not having any as she didnt want more. (She is 15 years older than me). She never felt comfy with my younger friends, now I realise I no longer have them for not meeting up (I find out they got married, all meet up and do stuff and I never even heard about it or got invited to anything, just because I drifted away), we would go where she wanted on holiday (sunny, hot, nothing to do anywhere as opposed to my like walks, visiting places, local foods), always watch what she wants at home on tv, I had to watch my stuff by myself, but then got whined at if I went to watch anything. Insecure of ANY female around my age I spoke to, sometimes not speaking to me for a few days after I'd she just saw me talk to someone.

So yea, I get the relationship was actually toxic, and bad, and I'm glad it's over. Heck, the person she is seeing now, I think she was seeing and sleeping with well over a year ago. Go figure.

Now, the problem is the housing market. I'm stuck, living with her still, and not just her, but her 2 kids.

I'm trapped, living with essentially another family, who dont want me there. The atmosphere changes between amicable, to horrific and tense. Sometimes I'm fine, sometimes I feel small, sometimes im worse than a piece of shit someone stepped in, in what is my own home, the place I should have peace. 

I just feel burnt out and drained.

I dont know what I'm coming back to, things were fine again all last week, everyone laughing and chatting away, then 3 days ago, apparently I broke something of exs (while I wasnt even in, was at work, and in a room I never go in, but....it MUST have been me, as the girls said it wasnt them). So now I have silence and huffing whenever I walk around or past her, and the girls just ignore me to not annoy their mum. Its like I dont exist, and I feel so empty and small, and just like crying all the time. 

Work is hell, but sometimes I feel that's better than being at home.

I can go and see friends and family occasionally, but that isnt the peace I want, I want somewhere I can go to to escape, by myself, with no atmosphere sometimes, and I feel I have that nowhere. It's like suffocating and not being able to breath, and I dont know how much more i can take.

I've started trying to see people, and in fact have met up with people off tinder, or even off reddit. Its and escape, however as a guy, my tablets had....side effects I wasnt bothered as much about when I wasnt seeing anyone and my ex split from me. So I went cold turkey about 2 months ago, as I couldnt put up with the side effect as I didnt want to lose that escape by having hook ups. I'm coping ok without the tablets, but it's hard at times. The tablets didnt help with my issues and circumstance though, and to be honest off them, I'm not sure they helped that much other than make me feel numb but still down. Its...hard to describe?

I even had one person start to get really attached, and I'll admit, I started falling for her. But the complications at home a relationship for me hard. I cant bring anyone home, to her and her kids (shes lucky, her new fella is local, and has his own place) as that's not fair on the person I bring back, who would want to come into this house! Then out of the blue, she cut me off and told me she wanted more, I couldnt offer her more and i think that actually hurt more than my ex. I actually had a lot in common with the person, and we actually did stuff we both enjoyed, and got on really well. I wish I'd treated her better, and said how I felt sooner, but maybe it wasnt a good time or right either. 

I also struggle with money, as I've always paid more on the house, and we split other bits, shopping, activities out etc. Now I'm paying most stuff still, but have to buy everything else myself, sometimes just fuel to get about is my monthly money gone after bills. I'm basically paying for all the major cost of how much electric, water and heating 3 women use (2 teenage girls, it's a LOT). 

I'm forcing myself to get healthier, eating better, exercising and I feel better in that sense, but nothing seems to be helping head. I dont know how I can get through this block of time, and I see no light at the end. I imagined the house would be sold by now, but houses round me just arent selling well and loads are for sale already. 

I dont know what the point in posting is, like I say, I think I just needed to ramble and get stuff off my chest. I'll probably remove this at some point, I'm not sure."
3614,I depend on porn too much.,"Idk why. I saw it when i was 10 through a friend and idk I just started clinging to it almost immediately. It really wasn't until now that I started to realize my problem. It makes me feel utterly ashamed at all times of the day whenever it comes to this. I wouldn't even actually pleasure myself at times. I'd just sit there and watch. Continue to sit there  and just watch. I started downloading full movies to fill up a harddrive and for what? To just sit there and watch like a mindless zombie? I feel disgusting. I just have a horrible habit that i need help to kick. I have a girlfriend now and I'm scared that I'm going to disappoint her or scare her off if she were to find out. I know this is a weird issue to post, but I'm 20 now, and i wanna stop. I've never really been honest about this before."
3615,Depression and How A Helping Hand (thru strangers can help) Lets talk,"I've been dealing with severe depression since the middle of my enlistment (Navy here). I know some (very small percentage) of you are thinking how do you have depression/ptsd from the navy. You were on a boat for crying out loud. Crying out loud indeed, but within. Being separated from the outside world with a significant other free loading from couch to couch not knowing and general quarters (battle stations) can make a man find some kind of Jesus within himself. We called GQ and as a firefighter (secondary Job) we prepare for the worst and I mean the worst. When you realize that a carrier and how big it is can only go so fast in certain parts of the world you become aware that you are a sitting duck and have a fat and I mean (Phat) price tag on your head. you start to worry that you might drown, get blown to shit, suffocate, etc, etc. Idk why I always have to explain myself when you can get PTSD from a bad friendship let alone partnership. Anyways, I get my dear john letter and it gave me the biggest blow I could ever imagine. This was the woman I wanted to marry and someone I still have incredible feeling for. I get off deployment and come back home to find sent text messages to my phone by men that have done the deed with my partner. Off the plane I walk looking for her car at the airport I read, look at photos, and watch videos of her with other men. It was the biggest upset of my life. Here I am home finally from maybe knocking on deaths door to find the woman I absolutely cherished a woman I stayed clean for and the woman I promised would be the only one to lay with me has turned her back on me and there is proof. Since being in the navy I say the only real skill I truly pulled away from the grip of uncle Sam was how to drink professionally. I can drink a grown man that's 20 years older than me been drinking for decades longer than me look like its a normal Monday and go to work the next day. I'm 6 foot tall 200 pound man and I can damn near drink my weight in whatever liquor you throw or pour my way. I've drank two marines under the table and won blooding knuckles (the coin game) against both of them. I like to party and I need to be the center of attention but when that falls short I lash out. Sometimes I lash out before that, getting a sudden urge of anger that I can't help but find myself standing before 1, 2, sometimes 3 people and I wake up in the morning with a busted lip, fucked up hand, bruises I cant account for. Reading my text the next morning never helped and realizing I have great friends that continue to help me get home even tho I've ruined their night makes me smile inside. The truth is, yes I have a drinking problem I don't like to admit it but its there hovering in the background like your brother when you play a video game. It truly brings on those deep dark thoughts that you thought you'd never have. I didn't think I would but I should do now. I sit up at night thinking about all the wrong that I've done and the people that I have hurt and it never cures it. It only makes the problem that much worse because now I dream about it. Its an around the clock problem of how I have somehow fucked up my once perfectly good life. At one point I had it all, beautiful girlfriend, beautiful home, great job, awesome friends, and family I'd never turn my back on. Unfortunately at some point of my bullshit stampeding they had forgotten about me because I was a lost cause. My mother stopped answering my drunk calls at 6 am my father stopped putting up with my bullshit my brother looked down at me at every corner of our life my twin sister wouldn't allow me to see my nieces and nephews. I was falling harder into an alcohol induced and even when I was sober induced depression that I couldn't fight, talk, or drink my way out of. If you're still reading this I thank you from the bottom of my heart because I'm fighting everyday to not end it here this early. I have dreams of becomes a great father but in the state of mind that I'm in now I wouldn't put anyone in front of me to hear my bullshit. I refuse to take prescription drugs because it has led 3 of my close friends to checking out early. I just hope that whoever is reading this can take a step back and think about themselves for a moment. I get by life knowing that it wont be this way forever. Nothing is forever, we are given this great opportunity to feel and to be loved and to most importantly give love. You're not alone, I'm here with you and if you ever need anyone to talk you through a hard time at any point in your life please send me a message I beg of you. I've been helped by many and I will always lend out a helping hand to those in need veterans or non veterans. Depression is no fucking joke and I'm ready to let my shit out and help as many people as I possible can. I love you all for reading my rant that I wrote at 4 A.M I'm currently having an episode and writing it down helps me so maybe you should give it a try brother/sister. Much love and you can always heal through music my friends and family. Memes also help &lt;3"
3616,how to be happy without alcohol?,"I'm currently facing that problem that I can't feel anything, except I drink alcohol.

like I can't even be sad. when I'm sober I'm just completly empty, not even sad I'm just empty. I wish I could be sad, but I just don't feel anything.

my whole life consists of waiting for the weekend so I can get drunk and while I know it's not good to get wasted every weekend I don't know how to change it.

I'm a piece of shit. I wish I could meet a girl that loves me, but I'm such a big piece of shit I don't think I will ever meet someone who truly cares about me.

i hate myself"
3617,i need answers please,"i hate my life. honestly i’m so sick of everything. sick of the bullshit, sick of hating myself, sick of fake friends, sick of feeling scared all the damn time, sick of sleeping till 5 in the fucking evening, i’m sick of life man. i really wonder sometimes if everyone wants to kill themselves at some point or if something’s honestly wrong with me. i just want to die basically every day. does this make me depressed? my therapist called me depressed one time although i’ve never actually told them i just want to die all the time, but i’ve never been diagnosed with depression but it does run in the family. like should i be on meds or something? i really just don’t know what to do. i just want answers or opinions or help i guess"
3618,I miss cuddling with friends,"I've spent most of my life feeling socially isolated, frustrated that I couldn't connect to people how I wanted to. But there was a time in my early 20s when I had very close friendships, the kind in which we could cuddle platonically and it wasn't weird, tell each other all our secrets, and be our weird uninhibited selves. Now I don't have friends like that. I have a few decently good friends, but there's some barrier between me and them that I feel. 

I don't usually feel like I can fully be myself, because now I feel like I need to measure up and be some ideal version of me that I'm not. It's only in moments of crisis that I can let go of that. 

I just ended a relationship where there was a lot of intimacy, but it wasn't the kind I wanted. There were too many   
expectations, and I was being heavily idealized. In those friendships I used to have, neither of us thought the other was perfect--we knew each other's flaws--but we still loved each other. That's what I want.

There were some tough times in those friendships, some conflict, and maybe that's why we fell out of touch. I think I actually made the mistake of not idealizing those friendships enough, of taking them for granted, and becoming resentful over time...I also didn't develop myself enough outside of them, and they became all-important to me, which I think wasn't very healthy.

I want to be a better and more independent person now, but I also do want to experience that closeness and freedom to be myself again. I don't know how to find that combination. If anyone does, please let me know their thoughts on the matter. In the meantime, I'll just try harder to be a good friend to those around me, in whatever limited capacity I have right now. And I'll keep feeling sort of lonely but hopeful I could find it someday."
3619,I have just realized something,"It’s not really interesting and maybe it doesn’t belong here but I need to share it because I’m so angry. 

It hit me like a rock yesterday when my sister cancelled our plans to go out because she doesn’t want to sit in the car while I’m driving. And no, I’m not a bad driver, just a casual. 

Whatsoever.. my sister doesn’t trust me and that’s the only aspect she can’t hide it. She always treats me like I’m stupid just because I had a rougher life than she did. Same counts for my family... It really opened my eyes, how they were all looking down on me, pity me. 

And now that I’ve got everything together they’re acting super proud etc but only because they didn’t expect me to get somewhere in life. 

I wish I could tell them straight to their faces that I don’t care about them anymore. I don’t need this fake bullshit. 

Sorry if this was confusing. I’m just glad I could write it."
3620,I just want normal,"I just need to get this out there. My insecurity will lead me to write some fucking disclamer bout who I am but i'll skip that in hope of trying to actually be who I am. But thats it right there.. whoever I am is shut down, A lot people seem to like me and hang out with me but I'm in pain and no one is there when its real. All I want is a real connection but everyone is half-way-present. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its my fault for not being able to function socially I guess and also abusing drugs. I never wanted to do drugs but my parents and everyone make me constantly feel like everyday I choose to say fuck you to them and to living properly. Its not that, I just want to make it through the next day. And not even for me. I dont want to live for me at all and its so tough. I'm only here because I don't want to let down people who dont put any efffort into just being there for me and taking interests in my likings. Why do I do this? no one gives a shit anyway, im the only one who cares and i just get pushed away when i try to say how i feel. I cant do this

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the brick of text but... fuck"
3621,Why do I have to be so short?,"Guy, 15 years old, 5'6""

&amp;#x200B;

It's been rough :("
3622,It's all coming back,"All of it. All of the twisted thoughts that come with my depression and BPD. I'm pushing everyone away. I want to fucking die. 

I'm finally in a good living situation, have been for about 6 months now. I know it's good. I know I'm lucky. I have a great partner. But it's all coming to a head right now, and I took it out on the matriarch of the house, the person bending over backwards to get me on my feet, over message, while she's out of town with her sick mother. All because I felt she didn't communicate something to me ""properly"". How fucking selfish am I!? 
I couldn't just put it to the side. I forgot that her mother was sick because of my stupid selfish brain. And I went on a borderline suicidal rant about how I no longer want her to bring home the small pets I was going to rescue, because i decided I am going to move out and they would make it infinitely more difficult. 
So now I also have to tell the person, who is very close to me, that I can't take the pets. They are going to be devastated at having to find someone else. 

This is why I wasn't close to anyone for so long. This is why I made myself homeless at 17 and cut everyone out. This is why I wish I fucking died when I had the chance. 

I can not maintain relationships. 

All I want to do is going back to being a homeless useless nobody who nobody thought about or cared about. I couldn't let anyone down that way. 

And I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen if i move out. You see, I'm such a piece of shit that I get money from the government to live even though I am technically an able bodied young (20) person. 
So I'll barely be afford to pay rent if I even manage to find somewhere pet friendly. Which I probably won't. So my dog will have to go. He's my entire life and kept me alive after being on the street but I'm not doing right by him these days anyway. 

I'm sorry for ranting but i want to fucking die. I want to self harm so bad but I fucking can't because it will trigger my partner. 

Now I feel like I've ruined everything. Matriarch says she hopes I stay for another year but won't stand in my way if I go. And I don't believe her. I don't think she wants me to stay. I don't see how she can forgive me for what I've done tonight. How fucking selfish I was.

All the other people in the house are going to ask me why she didn't bring the rescue animals that I was so excited about. I'll have to tell them it's because I didn't think I could handle it or that it's because I'm moving and nobody wants pet rodents in their rental. 

All if this is such stupid small shit when i re read it. But that's just it. I'm not equipped mentally to handle the small day to day things that we as human beings have to deal with. 

If my boyfriend wasn't snoring in bed next to me, I'd off myself. But he just had a death in the family so even going out to do it away from him would devastate him. I am so trapped. 

No reason to reply or comment on this. I'll end up deleting anyway. I just needed it out for a minute. Fucking end me"
3623,staying home all day,"I don’t leave the house on days I don’t have class and I don’t even want to go. Feels safe at home. Everyday is the same. No friends, nothing to do except video games and waste the rest of my youth away. Sick of life."
3624,I am jealous of my friend who killed herself...,"She was the most amazing person I have ever met: the most caring, the most understanding and also the biggest shit disturber in the world (but I wouldn’t have her any other way.) She was the first person I called when I was in the emergency room for suicide watch, she forced me to go out with her on my birthday when I didn’t want to leave the house and the list goes on of things she did to help me... basically she was just a genuinely good person. 

We had far too much in common. We talked several times about how we were both too p**sy to cut deep enough to actually kill ourselves and how the thought of messing up a suicide was also a huge concern. I think it is for this reason that one of my first emotions when I learned of her death two months ago, was jealously. I feel so guilty for having that emotion even go though my head as should have ONLY been feeling sadness for the loss of a dear friend however it was definitely a strong feeling and it still is. 

I guess I feel almost competitive... and I lost. I feel that she was able to achieve something I think about all the times I am not able to follow through with. I felt like we were on the same page when we said we were both not strong enough to actually follow through... but she was in the end. And that makes me feel weak and ineffective. It makes me feel like a coward and makes me almost resent her. What incredibly selfish thoughts I am having but they are there and I don’t really know what to do about them."
3625,"i’ve recently started sertraline. will that eventually help me feel normal? or is it more of just covering up the depression, if that makes sense","im starting sertraline and i have a few reservations because i am already pretty dependent on cannabis and kratom, and it would not be optimal to just go from one dependency to another. the thing is, life is so bleak without drugs, it always was waaaay before i started so it’ll be really hard to fall back to normal life without any sort of escape mechanism. i will stop cold turkey in a couple days to better measure the effects of sertraline, but im worried that life will majorly suck and then ill just feel numb or whatever. 

my question is if sertraline is another distraction, like drugs? does it actually really help fix the root of the problem, or is it just kind of making the effects less visible, like using tylenol for pain or something? if i am to commit to this, will it eventually get better, and is it worth having a boring and bleak life for a bit? not just sertraline, but the whole SSRI process?

sorry, i know this is quite rambly—ive been awake for way too long"
3626,sober for 8 months,fuck it  it has been 8 months since the last time i did some blow (addicted for 2 years) but rn i'm so fucking depressed i just wanna use every single drug that i can find i know it won't help me in the end and i know i shouldn't do it but fuuuuckkk it's so hard to stay sober some days i think if i don't pop a pill i'll end up killing myself
3627,relapse,"in late 2017 everything started spiralling downhill and i was diagnosed with depression and all throughout 2018 i was in and out of the psych ward for awhile. it got better towards the end of that year. when 2019 came i started doing amazing things, getting a job, weaning off meds, eating well and exercising, doing extremely well in school and even getting multiple scholarship offers. these gave so much hope to my family and my psych team and they were even planning to discharge me completely. however recently everything that happened back then in 2017 and 2018 is repeating itself again.  all the little signs of me slipping are showing up once again. i don’t have the heart to get help and crush everyone’s hope in me. even if i wanted to, my therapy sessions are so widely spaced out so i’ll have to hold everything in until i see my therapist about a month later and i’m not sure how much longer i can hold on for"
3628,I'm broken.,"I'm 22. In the military and deployed right now.

My life has been a struggle from day one. I suffer constant depression, nightmares, and loneliness.

Most of it, I fought through, and I've beaten my demons back into the fucking ground.

3 days ago I received a ""Dear John"" letter from the love of my life. (For those who dont know what dear John, its basically a break up letter)

I never saw this coming. Ever. Not for the rest of my life.

I dont know what to do. I dont know where to turn. I'm thousands of miles away from home. No friends, family, and now without the support of my love.

I dont know what to do."
3630,Why do people think love exists?,"Like I don't get it. I've had a mom that's been into drugs for 15 out of my 26 years of living. A brother with an autoimmune disease? Why do people think real love and god exist? Ever feel like you're just a tortured soul that is owned by satan? I've tried Trazodone, Prozak, Mirtzapine to no avail. I can't even fall asleep anymore on Mirtazapine."
3631,i dont know,"my boyfriend thinks i’m depressed and have been for a while. he also thinks this is the worst i’ve ever been. 
i haven’t been getting too many suicidal thoughts but the number is steadily increasing. 
i’ve started skipping school, sport and social events because i’m so drained which i’ve never done before. 
i’ve spent more time sleeping and wishing i was asleep than i have in a while. i’ve had trouble falling asleep which has never happened and spend a lot of my time staring at my celling. 
i feel broken and useless.
my family and friends haven’t seemed to notice a change in my behaviour yet. 
i’m not diagnosed with depression. 
i think i’m just iron deficient and overdramatic.

any opinions?"
3632,"I hate my job, and I don’t know where to go.","I work at a dead end job in fast food to make some quick money so I can pay rent while I wait for the next semester of classes to start at a university I don’t even know why I’m still attending because the reason I even wanted to attend college in the first place fell through so now I’m just stuck paying for rent in a lease I can’t leave for the next semester, taking classes I don’t even care about, to get a degree in something I’m not even sure I want to get a degree in. All while working 40+ hours in a shitty Mcdonalds job because it’s the only place in this dead end town that will hire me because I have no applicable skills other than fast food because that’s all I did as a teenager and of course I haven’t taken any meaningful courses in college because they’ve all been gen ed courses and I haven’t even touched any major classes, not like it matters because I don’t even know what I want to major in anymore. And its just really hard finding a reason to keep going on when all I do is slave over a hot grill for 8 hours, go home and go to sleep, wake up, rinse and repeat. And then when classes start back up, it’ll be go to classes, immediately go to work afterwards, fail all my classes because I have no time to study, contemplate why I’m even still living at this point, and then go to sleep. Rinse and repeat. I don’t know where I want to go. I know what to do. I feel like I’m trapped and I need professional help to guide me to some kind of good decision. Because right now I’m really struggling trying to make the right decisions."
3633,Is depression part of getting older?,"Most of my post-pubescent life I have dealt with depression, but it's only gotten more frequent and more extreme as I've gotten older.

Lately I've been experiencing total anhedonia, where my favorite game, movie, music don't make me feel anything at all. Hanging out with friends is almost exhausting, and I have to fake being positive and laughing, etc.

Is this just part of growing up? Is it time to finally start devoting my time to purely practical things? Joy is just for children and young adults? I'm 25 years old, btw."
3634,Contemplating suicide,"I think I am about to go do it next week.  I planned the day and time.

3635,"my step dad has been an asshole for years and I don't know what do about it anymore, any advice is appreciated","I'm 24. I don't live here with my mom and step dad anymore. I live in another state and am trying to do things up there after college. Anyways, I'm an only child, and my mom married this guy when I was 12. Never liked him. Went through another divorce case at 13 to go live with my dad. That is still traumatic to this day, it's just a huge scar. 

This guy is such a worthless human being. His comments and tone set me on fire, I've never heard someone speak like he does. I just got surgery today on my wisdom teeth and I'm back home at their place for about 3 weeks, maybe longer. Anyways I always ignore him as much as I can, don't leave my room to even grab water sometimes, or food. 

I'm rambling, but tonight my mom and I were talking about my grandpa, her dad, that just passed a month ago. She was talking about this shirt that she got him for Christmas. She was joking and said he probably burned it because he joking hated it, she didn't find the shirt after cleaning out his house. Then my step dad, who ALWAYS makes fucking comments when my Mom I are talking on the couch and he's just sitting in his chair on his fucking ipad playing this stupid game 12 hours a day goes ""he should of burned the cat too while he was at it"". then my mom said ""Oh my gosh, stop, don't say that"". Then he says, ""I don't care. I'm being serious, she's terrible, he should have burned her too"". Then my mom goes stop talking that way, and i butt in after I'm high as a kite from my wisdom teeth surgery and say that's fucked up, why would you say that? He then again says ""I don't care, she's a terrible cat"". My mom and I probably told him 5 times to stop saying that, and he wouldn't stop, it fucking hurt thinking about him basically getting pleasure from our cat burning to death. 

He's a sick worthless fuck. His comment history is just piled with fucked up comments, I promise you it's a fucking million more things than just this incident. He's been fucked up at 2 funerals now, and every day, almost every fucking conversation I try to have, he;s fucking butting being a fucked up smartass! It's unreal! Back to the conversation, my mom said anyways moving on, I guess my dad got rid of the shirt because I couldn't find it, oh well. Then my step dad ended the conversation again saying ""yeah well he also forgot to burn the cat"". I know what he'd say if we started to yell, he'd say y'all are so sensitive and I'm just kidding. Jeez get over it. Mother fucker then why did you say Im serious and that you don't care?? Then, when we changed the subject, why'd you go back to it? I don't deal with shit like that, especially when my mom I are still struggling with my grandpas passing which he reluctantly helped out for because he just tries to look good in front of my mom's family. Behind closed doors he's a monster. I try my fucking hardest to not hate anyone, but I can't help that out of everyone I have met in my life, I truly hate him, and cannot wait for the day he dies. The trauma from 12 to 24 will never leave me. I will never be at his fucking funeral. 

I'm starting to lose it now as I've grown from a kid to an adult. I've been so close to hitting him or just slapping him hard as hell, but that would just cause a lot of drama. It's like no matter what I do or day, or what my mom says, he just won't shut up. He's constantly trying to be right even when's he dead fucking wrong, it's amazing. Such a piece of shit. I wish I could type more but this is getting long. Thank you so much if you've read this. I just wanna ask y'all.. I'm lost, and I don't know what to do anymore, I tell my mom that he hurts my feelings and makes me uncomfortable all the time, especially when she's out of the house, and she always says she's gonna say something or do something, but she's a broken record on this. They'll never get divorced, I've pretty much accepted that. Some days I really, really do feel like raising hell, maybe I will. He just needs to shut the fuck up. It;s been 12 years now and he just won't change, ever. After being talked to so many times, he just goes right back to his fucked up ways. God I can't wait til the day he dies. It will be such a fucking relief. So.. what do I do? Going to the police seems extreme, but a possibility, I've told some of my family members and they just don't do anything about it because ""they're not married to him"" or it's not their problem. It feels so fucking hopeless. Do I raise hell? Should I raise my voice more? Should I slap him, throw something at him? Screaming into my mom for 12 years has gotten this nowhere. I'm too fucking nice sometimes. I can't fucking take it anymore, I am going to fucking snap. WHAT DO I DO?"
3637,just blanked someone,"I was walking my dog. A girl further down the road, also walking a dog, crossed to the other side. Her dog started barking. She then shouted, what seemed to sound like, ""morning!!"". It just seemed so alien to me that another human being could greet me with warmth and friendliness that I was taken aback. My brain quickly explained away this impossible occurrence as me having misheard her, and that she had actually probably said her dog's name in response to its somewhat aggressive barking. Maybe it was called Marnie - Marnie could be mistaken for morning, idk. Anyway, I went with my brain's explanation, and so didn't reply. Immediately afterwards I concluded that she had probably said morning after all.  I know this isn't a big deal, but I feel really bad. I know if I made the effort to enthusiastically greet a stranger and that stranger were to completely blank me, I might never do it again."
3638,I have not been feeling well mentally,I go to community college and for the most part it was okay. I actually failed one of my classes and it makes me feel horrible. The main reason I failed it was because of how terrible my mental health has been. I sleep all day and my room looks terrible. I eat just eat and sleep. Sometimes I dont even eat. I really have no one to blame but myself due to my grade. I dont really know what to do. It feels like I cant be a fully functional human in society. I constantly overthink everything. I went to therapy for awhile but decided not to because it felt like it didnt work for me. I'd just constantly act like I was fine to get out of it. Now I just constantly think about suicide. I just feel like I needed someone to know because I currently have no one to talk to. Also sorry first time posting on here
3639,I just want my girlfriend to not love someone else.,"I just want to be enough for someone once in my life. I spent my whole life taking the back seat to the more important things going on in everyone's life while trying everything in my power to be the most important thing to them and I've never been successful. At the end of the day I'm not interesting to talk to. I have a lot to say but lack the words to get it out and worry too much about social mores to start a conversation about the things that are on my mind and am too concerned about the social institutions set up to restrain people who think like I do. From time to time, I let bits and pieces of it out to those closest to me but they always end up taking it as a personal attack in which case I end up defending how I feel until I fall back on a ""logical"" thought when I concede defeat. The thoughts never go away though and I'm left feeling like an imposter. A marionette walking through life being controlled by those around me and being what they want me to be. The fear of being alone is the strings which move me because being close to those who invalidate your emotions is better than being close to no one at all. Sometimes these moments come during good times too though. I get told that I have a good heart from time to time. Most recently at a party, I noticed a guy go outside and just stand for a while. He wasn't smoking. Just standing around. So I went and checked on him. He was fine, I assume. We talked for a little and he came back in and everything was fine. It makes me wonder though. Who is coming to check on me? Sometimes old problems just make their way back around. My girlfriend is friends with the girl she cheated on me with which is ultimately what she wanted all along. She spent months on and off trying to coax me into accepting it. She swears it's different now but why should it even matter? I've given everything I have to her and the only thing that will truly make her happy is someone else in her life. Even now as I write this she's messaging her while I sit on unread being overlooked for things more interesting. I ended up making her feel bad about it and looking through their messages she's concerned about crossing boundaries as a girlfriend yet still asked her to come over after skating. I will say nothing and continue living my fake life where I pretend my girlfriend can love me and only me, where I pretend not to know all the ways she's lying to me about what they talk about, where I pretend not to know that she's taking adderall again, where I pretend not to notice that she tries to help everyone through their problems while telling me that I need to talk to someone else, where I let this lie permeate through my whole being until it gets worse and worse. Just like last time where my ability to do my job degrades, and then the ability to even sit in a room with people talking, and then simply breathing becomes a struggle and I begin to panic. Please just get me out of this."
3640,I have no one left,"I’m lesbian, my partner and best friend, and I split apart today. We were together for just over 4 years. We had been on and off back and forth for years but the breaking point finally came and I’m not even sure what it was.

I feel broken, I feel alone, hopeless and worthless. They were my last real friend and now I have no one. Not family, no friends, just strangers. I’ve spent the past 2 hours just crying my eyes out and I’m exhausted. I want to hug someone and just cry. 

I tried to eat but I don’t have the motivation. I’m starving and dehydrated but I don’t want to eat or drink. I just want to die. With her leaving, this now marks a 100% turnover rate for every friend, I have ever made. All of them have left me for various reasons, some legitimate, some selfish. I have no one left. I feel like if I killed myself no one would even notice. No one cares about me anymore and honestly I’m not even sure I’m still able to be saved regardless. I’m tired of trying. I’m tired of making friends to lose them. The longest friend I ever had was only 6 years. I’ll be 21 in a few days. I feel like I’m a ghost, no one notices me and no one cares about me. I’m screaming for help and no one hears me. I’ve screamed for so long and for so loud that my lungs have given out and I’m tried of screaming. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I just want this hell to be over. I want to just fade out of existence as quickly as I came and never feel anything again. I don’t want to be conscious any more. I don’t want to exist. I don’t want to feel anything. Good, bad, or emptiness. I simple want to stop existing, I’ve already stopped living."
3642,My life is full of regret,"I’m a sophomore in college and I’m in the midst of finals rn and I did something today that makes me wish I was dead because I regretted it so much. I had one of my finals this afternoon and my friend made a poorly timed comment in an instagram GC of ours when I was talking about how confusing my professor made things and after he made that comment I (In anger and not thinking) said something that I really shouldn’t have. What I said was below the belt level shit talk and it made me feel awful and guilty, (because objectively speaking, I am the proof is in the GC). It made me want to end my life on the spot because I realized what I said was terrible and hurtful. I want to be a doctor or a physicians assistant, but I let my own selfish interests of doing well on the final get above my rationale. I’m still kicking myself because it’s another thing that I’m going to regret for the rest of my life and it’s something that I can’t stand to life with. I honestly regret being not dead sooner. My mom would’ve had a much easier time without taking care of me and I would’ve never done or said things that make life so hurtful to myself and others. I hate myself  more than anything."
3643,I even hate my art now (rant),"I dont even know what to do, I'm at a loss. I've been depressed for years, I dont remember the last time I was really happy. For the past few years, I've been concentrating on venting through art since it wastes a lot of time and I just want time to pass quicker. Honestly, it was my only escape. For a few years I drew and sketched stuff, but i got enough negative responses that I kind of gave up. I started writing around the same time, but I realized that I got too invested in the characters and started thinking of them as my friends. This was obviously not mentally healthy, so I took a break from writing stories. I started writing lyrics (glorified poems) and music three years ago, and started recording and releasing it last year. I was actually not feeling bad when I made music, it gave me a sense of accomplishment, and I was actually improving at something for once. And then it all came crashing down. On Monday, I made a song using riffs that my guitarist sent, and I absolutely loved it. I sent it to almost everybody I knew, asking them their opinion, if the mastering was ok, if some parts felt out of tune... some people gave light criticism, but most seemed very surprised by how much they enjoyed the song. And that's when it hit me; I didnt actually like the song, I had just become so used to defending my art that I subconsciously convinced myself that I liked it. I went back through all my other albums, and I realize now that they're all awful. Every time I play guitar now, I get a lump in the back of my throat, and I cant concentrate enough to not make constant mistakes. I cant write lyrics because they're too preachy and emo. I cant play piano because my fingers aren't agile enough. I cant play drums because I dont have a good rhythm. Plus it's not even fun anymore. I'm devastated, this was the one thing I had left, and I cant do it. Everyone is expecting a new 12 song album before Janurary. I have 7 songs, and I can barely stand any of them. My current plan is to delete what I have so far and spend my free time sleeping for the next few months."
3644,update ish,"...Apparently my wife did cheated on me. I was furious. Then sad, immediately followed by disappointment. I really want to cry rn. I can’t....


I don’t know what to do. i just sort of got mad. my wife is a really proud one. she has never once (maybe sometimes on small things) said i’m sorry. 

I’m really thinking of our futures here. i did have a kid, still a younglings. I don’t know if i can stick up anymore. i don’t think i can continue. i want to disappear completely.

My mind’s a mess. Everything might seem abrupt here and there. I just need someone to listen. or at least to share my story."
3645,Where did you go wrong,"I’m young, 25. I’ve always been shy and awkward. I’ve always been ashamed of being me. Ashamed of being poor like everything that was wrong was my fault. And that’s how I grew up. When I was younger I could never fall asleep at night just worrying if I’ll be able to get lunch. Us being poor. How people saw me that’s what I thought 24/7. I still do, but lately I’m either drunk or high. Never been comfortable in my own skin. Tired of lying. Tired of failed relationships. I don’t care but I do. Cheers to anyone in the same hole. Always tomorrow"
3646,I need a little advice (going into therapy next week),"Okay. Yearly l, I go through SAD/anxiety with regular ol depression/anxiety or mania through the rest of the year. Today I stayed home from work and have had MANY thoughts about suicide. I want everyone to know that I have no drive to harm myself or anyone else. My issue is these thoughts stick around for hours or days and pushing them to the back of my mind is very hard. That's why I took off of work today.

My job allows me too much time to be alone with my own thoughts, there isn't enough to do to keep my mind occupied. Due to this I've attempted to mill over a few things during work. My issue is that I breakdown and cry almost hourly while at work. 

I usually get very irritable, followed by legitimately mad, shortly after this I cry. I'm going to see a therapist soon but I'd like some way to at least get through the week without needed to leave work early or to hide in the bathroom and cry.



I do legitimately want to be better at this point as I see my depression and anxiety is ruining my life, but until I can see a professional, how do I stay at work?"
3647,"Do you ever just sit there and stare at a noose, gun, knife, pills whatever and just think ""that one thing right there is the only thing that can 100% guarantee an end to my suffering?""","I'm just sitting here talking to people, fighting so hard for every fucking minute, nodding off at the too-many sleeping pills I took, trying to talk through solutions and thinking about how much work I have ahead of me and I'm just like



*OR*


I could stick my head right in there and be done with it. A *million* fucking times easier. SO much easier, that's the part nobody gets. Choosing not to kill yourself is ACTIVELY CHOOSING TO SUFFER."
3648,Shame,"I've always felt shameful of myself. Pretty much the result of child abuse and sexual abuse. Im a male in my 30's.

From the outside, I look ok, but on the inside, I have this storm of shame. I can't look at people in the eye. 

Ive been addicted to drugs the last 5 years. I've been battling to quit, but this depression, shame, and anxiety force me to use to get away from those feelings. I've lost it all, if I ever even had anything. I try to escape any which way I can to not have these feelings of shamefulness.

Sometimes I get angry at my shit parents, whom just didn't know better. But that doesn't change anything now. i have to quit drugs again to even have a chance at beating this. I know I need therapy, but even then, I feel so much fucking shame that I can never get myself to do it. I guess I have to step it up. 

Im so mad at how I was raised. Im so mad how incompentent my parents were, how all of my siblings are all fucked up because of their shit parenting. But I can't cry about it in my 30s now. I just know how important proper parenting is, how it can fucking ruin someone. How bullying can destroy someone's life in the future. I am the product of all of these things. I hate being so senstitive. I hate who I am even though I look ok, everything isn't that bad in reality, but I can't leave my bed. I can't leave the house. Everyone thinks Im lazy, but really, Im just fucking hurting and I don't know what the fuck to do. 

I would rather do drugs than to be myself. But I know it isn't the answr. I just don't know how to find the answer. Maybe Im damaged beyond repair. Maybe I was just meant to lose."
3649,Depression sucks lol,I’ve been so fucking depressed lately and I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about it without burdening their life with my problems. I don’t know if this is allowed but I just needed to put it into words somewhere.
3650,"Every time I start to feel remotely happy, I catch it and remind myself that it's a fleeting moment, and that things will get bad again.",Why can't I just enjoy something?
3652,Am I just being weak? Cursed?,"Hey guys. So ive struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. Ever since I can remember which was as young as 2, I just remember feeling a sense of sadness that has never left me. When I was 14 I discovered my love for music, I also loved movies, and then at 15 my love for lifting weights. I would schedule my day around those three things and they would each relieve my depression for a little while doing them. But, I'm now 26. I'm almost $20,000 in credit card debt. My career has not worked out, I have applied to over a thousand jobs and had less than 10 interviews with no offers. I'm mentally drained with scrambling every month. I live in LA. But the main problem I'm facing is Me. I feel like I almost see too much. I can't be happy. It's like I see behind the curtain of life. I'm too ""aware""  Idk if that makes sense. I see people running around and doing all these things and I think, what for? How could any of that make you happy in the grand scheme of things?... I had a rough rough child hood. I've been in and out of relationships constantly for the last 11 years. My last one being extremely emotionally abusive towards me which has not helped. Throughout my entire life I have had people always go after me and shit on me seemingly for no reason most of the time. I am a very shy introverted person but when they start going after me I of course speak up and stand up for myself which only makes them dislike me even more and gives them a reason to now. I used to give myself pep talks and tell myself that I was being overly sensitive and just back up until I would see people that I knew who were there and they would tell me ""wow, you really get shit on a lot huh?"" I would have girlfriends tell me ""a lot of bad things happen to you"" All of these things of course just reinforcing in my mind when I already thought in the first place. I don't find enjoyment in anything anymore. Music. Movies. Working out. Even sex. And im a full blown sex addict basically.  I feel absolutely nothing. My favorite part of the day a is sleeping. I have tried self-medicating with all kinds of herbs and online research with an incredibly vast array of supplements to no avail.  There doesn't seem to be a way out of my misery and I'm drawing to a close I feel. I am just so tired and want to have either some small happiness or, rest. Obviously nobody here knows me and my exact situation, so how can you tell if you're just being weak or if life seems to be shitting on you to an odd degree?"
3653,I’ll be dreaming,I hope I don’t wake up tomorrow. Good night.
3654,I just feel empty,I hate not feeling anything. I can't function anymore. I don't know what else to say but I'm completely miserable.
3655,Does anyone here feels the same as me?,"I'm so afraid of being judged by others, infact i'm so afraid that even walking or doing something while knowing that someone can see me makes me nervous.
I'm so scared.
I always get judged by my girlfriend and especially my grandmom when i made a mistake. I know my mistakes.
But is it really necessary to judge someone just because of their mistakes?
Sometimes they even say shits like i'm an idiot, retard, i should die.
It hurts. So much. So much that i really want to just disappear one day to just end this suffering.
I'm just 17. Even my friend told me that i'm still too young to be feeling this.
I don't know if i'm depressed or just suffering from social anxiety disorder but this shit is ruining my life so hard.
I'm so scared to be judged by anyone around me.
I always say to myself that i'm going to be stronger and prove them that they judged the wrong person but i just can't.
Most of the time i'm spacing out, even now, even when i'm doing something, i always look at something while thinking nothing.

I just wanted a life full of peace and harmony, a life where i can live at my own free will. But how?"
3656,How to forgive yourself ?,everyday i get so angry i wish i could let go of the past but i fucked up to obadly
3657,How do you stay out of bed?,Spent another day just sleeping. What do you do to resist the urge to sleep your life away?
3659,"Still not claiming to have depression, just thought I should put this on here","So I've been struggling for a while (I think I'm totally just a baby and overreacting) but you should see my arm, it proves how ""depressed"" I've been. And I think on Tuesday, I texted kids help phone (I'm 14) because I thought I was going to kms. And just so you're aware.. I'm afraid of dying, so I don't usually think about killing myself, but I did on Tuesday, that is only like the third time I've ever thought about it. And yeah. There you go."
3660,The perfect storm,"So Ive fought severe recurrent depressive episode for years now. This week, I was getting prepared for having a kidney stone remove, which just as fun as it sounds and leaves you in bed recovery for a week. And meanwhile, I’ve been diagnosed with a GI viral infection, which has left me unable to eat (I can’t keep any food down, even the blandest.). Yesterday all I had was ginger ale, slowly slowly slipped over a long period of time.today I’ve eaten some applesauce. So there’s some stability growing, even though I still feel awful. Had to cancel the kidney stone surgery because I haven’t eaten normal food in 48 hours. Through it all, the stone, the vomiting, the severe unreasoning depression brought on by those other two situations...

I’m so alone. And I’m so scared."
3661,Slightly concerned about my overbearing lust,"NSFW

You know how you change into a different person almost when you get really horny, but once you cum, you usually snap back into a normal person?  It's been taking longer and longer for me to snap back.  Recently it took me about 4 or 5 times in the span of a few days to finally calm down and regain control.  I guess masturbation has always been a problem for me.  

A real turning point though must have been the first time I sent a pic.  I was 16, using kik and started chatting with a 16 year-old-girl.  Or so they said.  It was most likely just some nasty old guy pretending so he could get pics of teens.  They convinced me to take a pic probably by saying they'd return the favor.  Didn't show my face of course, but they never responded after I sent it.  After that, it was like it unlocked something in me and I did it more and more.  

At first, only from users who said they were girls my age.  I was dumb and didn't think much about possible catfishes.  Eventually, I stopped caring about who as long as they complimented me.  It made me feel good and suddenly masturbation wasn't just about me.  However, back then I would change personalities pretty much, and whenever I finished, I would instantly regret what I did and tell myself to never do it again.  It was easy to say that after I just finished, but a week later and I would get the same urges.  The voice telling me not to do it suddenly became a soft, whimpering advice.

Once I went to college and got my first girlfriend, I stopped that.  I even told her about part of that past.  Fast forward almost a year later and the relationship is over.  Some months after that and I was back to it.  I even managed to sleep with a other girl I met on the app although I didn't enjoy it.  A couple more years go by and I even allow a guy I hardly knew online over to my dorm and we gave each other hj. I didn't like it.  Once it finished, I blocked him and swore to never do that again.  I even deleted all the porn from my laptop, phone, and cloud.  Not to mention all the bookmarks in my browser.  Took hours to delete over 13gb and 8000 gifs, pics, and videos of all kinds if porn.  Also forgot to mention my porn fetishes had gotten bad and I was scared of how much worse it would get if I didn't stop.  For once in my life, I was clean and felt great.

I just accidentally deleted a whole 3 paragraphs and don't feel like typing it all up again.  Short version: Depression got bad and went to group counseling sessions and learned to be more honest with people.  Tried online dating and it was horrible and my depression was at an all time high.  Started adding bookmarks back in browser but still resisted to keep porn saved on phone for more than a day.  Started making a VERY suicidal bio and although most girls only wanted to see if they could get a swipe from some like me, a girl did talk with me.  We met irl twice and talked for several hours.  Still couldn't romantically feel anything, but I rushed and tried forcing a connection, so we slept together after meeting the second time.  I didn't enjoy it.  Still wasn't emotionally or physically attracted to her romantically.  Still felt a little better though.  Brain having a hard time thinking of the more recent events, so I'll stop talking about them.

Recently, depression has gotten a lot worse and I would force myself to masturbate because I would feel a little better.  However, I am now fully back into camming and I don't snap back from the personality as quickly as I used to.

I've never told anyone this and am sure this will come up in therapy.  My original point in posting this has shifted part way through."
3662,Is it depression or what ? All i know is that i hate myself,"Hi all, i will just jump straight to the point where i think is that im severe depressed cuz of generaly myself, my curent state of life ( where i went from a great persona onced recovered from drug habbit, drinking, smoking ) to a person that started doing all those things again.. and curently i hate myself for all of that. I've never thought about suicide, yet. But i still hate myself a lot ! Also there is a fact that depress me always when i remember that is that i have a V-card still and it ruins me since even if i want to be with a girl im scared what if my first time goes away and i cant last etc etc .. So basicly my social anxiety ruins me as well since i cant be in a public place etc. Im a mess in short term"
3663,Am the only one that wishes there was help line or place for suicidal thoughts?,I don’t mean the ones we have that everywhere you turn someone’s trying to stop you. But actual help for people that just want to commit suicide and need help to go through with it? Like if you want to go through with it you go one place and if you don’t wanna do it you go get the other help.
3664,I can’t remember the last time I felt “normal”,"I can’t remember the last time I have felt “normal”/happy. I have been diagnosed with depression and have been on and off meds since middle school(25 now). You may have the question, why not just stay on the meds? Reason being, The meds do nothing. I have had multiple types, doses, therapy techniques... etc. nothing helps. Am I going to be depressed my entire life? I’ve come to the point where I’ve accepted that fate. That I will be forever stuck with depression. I’ve made it thus far, I don’t want to die. Yet I do not want to feel this way. The only option I see is death.. When I’m told to take meds, exercise, diet, I do it, but the depression pushes back and I give up after a while. I’m sure this is common? Posting because I need to figure out what to do. I have a 5 y/o child and that’s the only real reason why i even want to get better. But I just don’t see it happening.."
3665,Keeping up the facade is so tiring,Acting like everything is fine and putting on a happy face is starting to become so tiring.
3666,Today i called the national suicide hotline,Depression has always been a constant battle for me and lately it has been dragging me down quite a bit. I can usually narrow down why my depression is high at a point in time. Except lately I cannot think of a reason why I am sad and things have been rather bleak. Unfortunately I have been thinking about suicide but today I called the national suicide hotline and am setting up an appointment with a therapist. I'm hoping it's a start for me to get treatment which I have for the longest time put off due to pride. It was hard making the call but I'm glad I did. My friends and family also have no idea.
3667,Big yEeT,"I confessed to my crush and now it’s really awkward between us
And she was my best friend"
3668,Good news,I absolutely hate my job but today I got a call from a place that's willing to train me in welding it pushed me through my day hopefully I'll get that new job
3669,Inescapable Boredom,"Hey, I am just wondering if anyone can relate.

I have been dealing with depression for a while now, and taking venlafaxine for the last seven months.

I am starting to notice a pattern in my mood, before the inevitable spiral downward. I tend to fall in to an inescapable sense of boredom.

The motivation and desire to do something is there, but when I actually do it I feel this overwhelming sense of dread.

I can't seem to push past this, so instead I sit around and stare at one screen or another."
3670,Anyone else feel uncomfortable being just okay?,"Heyo. I’ve been depressed for a really long time. My whole life, I’ve always found something to be upset about. I’ve berated myself for years over the smallest things—once even going so far as to contemplate suicide because I didn’t raise my hand enough during class. 

After a year of cognitive behavioral therapy, I’ve arrived at this place of contentment, where I feel not bad... but not good either. It doesn’t feel right. It’s like contentment makes me feel so uncomfortable. It feels like I’m stuck—or maybe plateauing?—but definitely not improving. It makes me guilty because then I feel as though I’m not appreciating the progress I’ve made. 

This feeling of “I’m not okay, but I’m not bad”—is such a new feeling for me. I personally feel as though I don’t even deserve to feel anything but bad. So, I punish myself by not eating, sleeping, or taking care of myself. I become a recluse, who can’t return a text because it conflicts with my assumption that “nobody cares”—when I know that’s a lie.

My theory is that I am trying to make something bad out of nothing in order to bring my body back to its status quo: I’m not normal if I’m not sad. But when I’m sad it’s: I’m not normal if I’m sad. 

Anyways, I know my brain is fucked. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this too."
3671,Nothing exciting,Happens anymore. Irl and in video games it just feels so dull
3672,Dont do anything crazy people,"Not sure, but maybe 2 years ago, my memory is terrible these days and life is just a big blur, i didn’t exactly attempt to kill myself, but i kinda did and lets just say im freaking lucky i survived.  I’m not going to talk about the event, but i knew how dangerous it was and even though i cared about dying and wanted to live, i was so messed up mentally that i convinced myself i didnt.  In reality i actually risked my life multiple times, but the one instance is especially frightening to me reflecting back on it and the reason i decided to write this.  Basically, dont be me people.  I was trying everything to get better for so long and i had lost hope, plain and simple.  I was on medicine, have a loving mother who only wants the best for me, have a dog who is my best friend, and so many opportunities, and i threw it all away by my actions that night.  I COULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF ME.  Yes, i know how much i was suffering, and yet at the end of the day i will still be haunted by my actions.  I am so grateful to be alive right now and thinking about how i nearly wasted my life scares me.  I feel shame and disbelief that i could have done the things i did.  I think aboht others who werent so lucky and it makes me so sad.  Please people, love yourselves.  I don’t know your life situations, but please for the love of god dont give up.  Dont cut your story short.  I never even felt like i got to live my story left, which just would have made it all the more tragic.  Im not trying to say woe is me, im just being real.  You will die someday as morbid as that sounds, everyone does and even though this life might not seem worth it in the moment just try to stick around.  You would be surprised how things can change even when you truly believed they wouldnt.  For me i was dealing with a lot of stuff that seemed like it would never go away and my quality of life was awful despite all the help i was getting, and i let it get to me.  I know we all are going through different things in life, and that is why i am starting to understand counseling.  I used to think it was a load of crap because there is no way anyone can help me, especially someone im paying to listen to me talk, but now i think im wrong and counseling can save lives along with medicine.  Antidepressants can help stabilize mood preventing extremes, help you sleep at night, etc... but they cant change your way of thinking.  They can only help take away some of the obstacles that might be making it too difficult for you to do anything at all.  Go to a counselor though, one that wants to help you, because ofc there is always a chance you go to a dumbass.  I think caring people who want to help gravitate to the profession, but there are always bad apples in everything.  Dont try counseling and then end it though because you are having trouble and impatient like me and automatically start assuming your counselor just sucks because in reality the few times i went i didnt really give it a chance since i never truly opened up and that is the reason you are there.  They cant really help you if they dont fully know what is going on and how you feel.  Be honest with them if they annoy you, in a polite way ofc, because if you are like me then everyone annoys you and it is a defense mechanism that you need to fight.  You don’t want to leave counseling because your therapist might be a jerk, no, this is about you, not them, air it all out with them.  Its better to know than to just give up like i did.  Obviously don’t be dumb and go telling random strangers your deepest and darkest secrets or acting weird, but you get my point hopefully.  Also, dont beat yourself up when you mess up.  Because guess what, we are human, you will mess up in life, its just how it is, the point is to try not to mess up so badly that something terrible happens.  Learn from the mistakes and move forward.  I honestly didn’t even think this was going to be a pro counseling post when i started writing, but now i just think to myself that as great as the internet is and the fact that you can be anon and vent, this isnt a counseling substitute.  I think counseling and medicine can save lives and probably could have helped me so much.  Dont do medicine only if you are able to do them both.  Trust me.  Anyways, with all that being said i think im going to have to start seeing a counselor again but for real this time.   So much for my short post."
3673,I have terrifying nightmares about my ex,"After me and my ex broke up (very awful story btw) she and I stayed friends. 3 days later she starts going out with this guy that lives in England (we live in nz) and she keeps on talking about him and it makes me soooo fucking angry. This guy is an idiot and extremely disrespectful to everyone. After we stopped talking cause this guy was being manipulative I started having dreams about him coming to New Zealand, raping my ex and then me walking in and he slits her neck right then and there. I can't stop thinking about her and worrying for her safety. I can't feel ok anymore knowing that this guy is manipulating her and forcing her to stop talking to her friends. I don't know what to do 😔"
3674,Am I really depressed or do I just want to be depressed?,
3675,Progress?,"If I ever decide to hmm “opt out”.. will it teach my little brother strength in any form? I’ve always been an obstacle for him to overcome and my life feats have always pushed him towards the next level. It seems that I am lacking material for him. He has surpassed me. My purpose has been served. Will my final “failure” help him progress at all?

Pain teaches lessons. Lessons learned in blood are not easily forgotten. Adult answers only. No compassion. No love. No forgiveness. Only logic and reasoning. Anything else will be disregarded. 

Thank you."
3676,don't know what i'm doing,"i don't know what im doing in life. i just finished my first semester of my degree and i'm doing really well gpa-wise. i have an amazing girlfriend now (i've never really had one until now). but i don't know what im doing most times.

&amp;#x200B;

lets start with my girlfriend. she's really great. basically all i have to say. really sweet all the time. a great person. but sometimes i don't feel good enough for her. even though it'd pain me to imagine her with someone else, i feel like she's better off without me. i don't want to lose her, i want to be better, but i almost feel that i couldn't blame her if she did. she texts really weird. some days it seems like she doesn't want to be with me, but every time i see her she falls right into my arms. so i don't know what to do. even though it's great and i'm lucky, i can't help but feel bad about being the worst thing for her. this fear of being the worst thing for her leads me to just constantly text her the sweetest things, but i don't get much more than an ""aww"" or something like that. i feel like i am incapable of true empathy and i should leave her to someone who can do better for her.

as far as my degree i'm doing good on paper, but i feel like i'm just a pretentious stuck-up freshman who thinks he knows more than he does. i did really great on all my exams and my final grade in my major classes were near perfect. but i know that's only because i tryharded. there are kids from far bigger schools with far better portfolios than me so i don't feel like i deserve anything that the CS faculty has given me as of now. i'm just a normal student who works a little harder. those kids are truly talented and could beat me out of they wanted to, but they don't care to because they are smart enough to know that an A is an A.

and as far as my future goes i have no idea. i don't know what i really want to do. i told myself i want to be a researcher or a professor but that's just wishful thinking. i don't have the money or the background or the intelligence to pull something like that off. i feel like my girlfriend will leave me (i can't blame her if she did), i'll finally get to the hard classes and fail, and even if i pull this degree off i'll be stuck in a desk job programming, gaining weight, and fully hating my life.

i try to extract passion for things but i've come to realize that's just me tricking myself into believing i like to learn. that was the reason i wanted to be a researcher or a prof, so i could constantly learn my whole life and become a real expert on something. but my passion is waning and it feels to just be something i've synthetically generated to protect my own ego kind of. something i've unconsciously created so that i don't realize how shitty i am.

everybody around me has something i don't have. the ability to really be part of something. im always half here and half there. not really fully present ever. it's a hard feeling to express, but it's easier to express it with a keyboard, where i can stay anonymous. i want to be present, i want to be a participant of this game that everyone around me is playing. but i feel like i'm doomed to be like this.

everything is going good. everything should be good. on the surface it is. but i'm just always missing something. i always feel like i have. i've never been a participant. i can't give my girlfriend the love she deserves. i can't do anything but delude myself into thinking i have some sort of potential, when i'll just end up like countless other people like me. stuck in a desk, fat, single, and as alone as i've always been.

&amp;#x200B;

even as i write this, i know i'm only doing it to make myself feel better about facing reality. reality is that life is hard. life feels like its constantly struggling for happiness and the ideal when it will never truly come as you expect it to."
3677,Does anyone else hate seeing happy couples?,"I go to the beach often with my dog because it’s my happy place and he loves the water, everytime I go though I usually leave early since I don’t like being around people. The thing that breaks me is that now and then a couple will come along and smile...laugh..in general have a nice time, I know it’s selfish but I hate it because I don’t have someone like that so I just end up getting sad and angry enough to leave"
3678,"Running making my mood worse after ""runners high"" wears out, but Yoga and stretching makes it better. I'm positive not every exercise kind is good for my mood, has anybody had similar experiences?","I'm sharing this story because it's something that's been bothering me and I wish to find whether others have had similar experience. It may also serve as encouragment to those who had the same failures and blamed themselves.

So, I'm a quite experienced runner by now, been jogging 1-3 times per week on average, 30-60 min per session, for the last 3-4 years I guess. I've built up quite a stamina, but am finding it increasingly taxing for my body and especially phyche, which I will elaborate. I'm taking SSRI antidepressant for the last 3 months, which has helped a lot.

The troubling thing I find with jogging/running is that it makes me very cranky, edgy, cynical, irritable and excessively tired after the initial ""runners high"" dissipates. I snap at my girlfriend, have snarky comments and do other little jerky thing which I'd never do if I'd hadn't gone running. I'm inclined to lay on the couch for half of the day because I get excesivelly tired and don't wanna do anything (not necessairly depressed but also not in good mood). The phenomenom seemed to spring into existence as my depression worsened. It seems to undo almost all benefits of SSRI treatment, and the worst thing is that I become a really shitty person. It would last the whole day, and tommorow I still feel the lingering fatigue. Mind you, fatigue was a very big symptom of my depression and it seems to be brain based because as I've said, I actually do have physical stamina.

Naturally I began to avoid running, especially intense one, and seek other ways to benefit my psyche with physical activity. I casually picked up Yoga and find out it's the exact opposite of running, it makes me very center, contented and calm while also giving me energy. Also, when I do the chores and other ""low intesity"" tasks for longer period of time, it's good for my psyche. Stretching exercises, also very good.

To sum it up:
Everbody talks about exercise being good for depression, especially aerobic one (e.g. running), but what I seem to find out is that all exercise may not work all that well when the mental state  or brain chemistry is disturbed. It may even provoke instability and make mental illness harder to deal with and also cause fatigue which directly makes depression worse. I think more ""integrative"" exercise types such as Yoga may be more productive thing overall.

Has anyone experienced similar thing with exercise?"
3679,In the worst depression pit I've been in in a long time,"Was dating a guy and totally in love when he ghosted out of no where. Spent weeks convinced there had to be some reasonable explanation bc I 'knew' he loved me and wouldn't do this lmfao. And on top of that I was so miserable I quit my job, I think I wanted to feel like I had control over something. It was a shit job but also not the best financial choice. 

I honestly want to die so badly."
3680,"I dont know, haha, anything",
3681,I'm sick of the lies,"Just kill me already, nothing helps, not medication, not therapy, not having ""friends"", not working hard




Once you are sad you are fucked for life. You can get better at hiding it but you can't ever become happy.






I just want someone to come and kill me already, I can't kill myself I've tried. Someone please free me and take me away from my own misery. I don't want your fucking pity anymore, stop telling me it will be okay just slaughter me so the pain will go away. Everything hurts even when I smile, actually especially when I smile."
3682,Just took 6 benadryl so I hopefully fall asleep before I hurt myself,"I'm feeling very seriously suicidal tonight and I have a method prepared and I'm home alone. I don't have anywhere else to go for the night. So it's just me home alone with my thoughts and my noose. Took the benadryl so maybe I'll just fall asleep before I do anything. I'll probably just crash on the floor or something like what usually happens but at least I won't kill myself.


But then again maybe i shouldn't even be fighting this and should just kill myself anyway"
3683,Just took 6 benadryl so I hopefully fall asleep before I hurt myself,
3684,I'm exhausted,"I started the year with six pets, a little brother, a functioning body, and a great outlook.

I'm ending the year with three pets, no siblings, barely able to walk some days, on FMLA for depression, and last Friday I came so close to killing myself that I ended up in the suicide naughty room at the er

I alternate between uncontrollable sobs and absolute numbness. Right now it's numb. One of my cats is dying. I'm giving him a good last night in the house and tomorrow he'll be put down. I love this cat. I do. He is my buddy. But I feel nothing. I might as well be planning to do my taxes. It makes me feel like an asshole. But there's just nothing left. I have nothing to give anymore. I don't know how much longer I can spend like this as I swing between feeling way too much and absolutely nothing at all.

I can't sleep. All I can do is smoke and stare at the wall and pet my poor cat. At least his pain will be eternally over tomorrow. Wish I could say the same.

2019 has been the worst year of my life and it gave me one last kick in the tit before it left."
3685,I ruined a friendship.,"Hey y’all. So I feel like I ruined a friendship because what I felt was my fault. 

So basically I texted my friend and I said “I feel like in class don’t nobody care for me when I’m trying to be cool but at the same time I keep to myself and all that shit because it’s like I can’t trust them people in that class idk... and it’s like sometimes u be forgetting about me and it’s understandable because you have other friends and I just have to deal with that. Nothing wrong with that at all. I feel like I just deal with stuff a lot because that is all I can do. But I feel like it’s my fault people don’t deal with me and all that shit. I feel like I put up a guard to every new person I meet because it’s like they don’t even try to get to know me but it’s not their job to get to know me. But I just had to say that. I’m not trying to start nothing it’s just like I’ve been holding that in for the longest.” 

So she replied back and said “If I didn’t care about you I would show it. Half of the time I don’t want to bother you because you be looking pissed off. Why do you feel like that? Also you have to put yourself out there. People aren’t always gonna come up to you. 

So I replied “u rite and idk it’s just so hard. I got all these trust issues that I can’t just open myself up that easily. But imma try.”

She said “but I’m not gonna force you to talk” and I said she was right that’s not anybody job. 

I said “thanks I needed that. Thank you for telling me the truth. I needed it.” Then she said “that sounded salty” And then I said “trust me it wasn’t”

So fast forward to Friday. She been ignoring the hell out of me so I texted her “are we good” and she said “nah but it’s all good” and i said “I said how I felt and what u said was right and I said thank you for telling me that. I ain’t mean no ill feelings behind it at all and I know it’s my fault that I’m not social and I’m sorry that I blamed you saying that you forgot about me” She then replies “i’m just saying. you kinda had no right to basically accuse me of ignoring you and forgetting you when all you do is sit around. You shouldn’t have put that on me. But it’s straight. Idc anymore.” And then I said “I know and I’m sorry. I said I was sorry and u have the right to feel the way u do and ok” 

So I guess we not good. I say hey to her sometimes she don’t acknowledge me. So im done with it. I admitted my fault in the situation and I’m not gonna force anybody to take me back as a friend. 

So what are your thoughts? Should I have told her anything at all? Was I right in feeling that way that I felt? Because I’m lost."
3686,How toxic is living exclusively for your significant other (vent/question),"I haven’t felt this okay in months but the motive behind all my actions outside of breathing and eating is still for my significant other. I can’t tell if it s a bad thing anymore. 

He’s a capable man but I watch his self worth tank every time my friend and I talk about our futures in college and career that’s been indoctrinated into us since we were kids, and I hurts me every time. 

I wish I could tell him that I pull myself out of bed every single day to go to class and learn nearly useless stuff so that he can finally get a taste of having real wealth and comfortable living. 
I don’t even want to live half the time let alone learn about stuff repeated from high school. Getting a degree or even a masters seems so far off that I lose sight and want to crawl into a hole of self loathing like I’m not gonna amount to anything. And every time just by looking at him it reminds me I have to at least try. Even if college isn’t for me I know I’ll find a way. 

And I’m not even saying this because I want him to feel bad for my doing it. He shouldn’t feel like he has to be grateful; I just want to give him everything I have and a comfortable life at the very very least. I want to give him the world because I owe him. He’s kept me here even when I was minutes from trying to leave again. I want to repay him for keeping me alive to see some of the brightest days I’ve had since I was a kid. I wish I could do so much more for him. 

I’m not even trying to be a martyr or anything. I just want to give him everything he deserves. 

TLDR: title"
3687,I hate myself and feel like a narcissist at the same time,"Anyone else feel like this? I definitely hate myself most of the time, but there are some moments where I feel like I know better than everyone else, mostly regarding depression. I will ignore people’s advice and act like they know nothing. It’s the main reason why it’s so hard for me to get help because I think I always know what’s best, even though I clearly don’t. I am definitely not a narcissist, but I definitely feel like one at times."
3688,I just can't win,Nothing I do will help not a single thing in the last two years I thought things would get better if I tried and I have been but I still feel exactly the same and I've ruined opportunited for just l myself I spoke to someone on the phone today who knows all the pathetic stupid worthless shit about me and how i just can't fucking fix anything in my life I was angry and upset and crying the entire phone call thinking about how there's just more and more people who know the truth about me that I'm just a worried nobody fuck up useless stupid bitch and I just can't be happy or get any better at all ever because I just don't deserve to and it's not like I have a future to work towards and motivate me anyway
3689,I've been slowly emerging from the worst depressive episode of my life. Here is what my brain was thinking over the past 12 hours:,"""I'm going to kill myself.""

""Yay, I feel great!""

""Yay, I'm going to kill myself!""

""I wanna climb a mountain!""

""I'm going to kill myself by trying to climb that mountain in winter!""

""Goddamn I'm tired. I'm going to bed."""
3690,What happened to my other half,"TLDR;
I feel stuck in my current situation despite having dealt with these feelings very well before but now I think the reason I can’t is because I have no will or drive to even want to be better anymore

I’ve been feeling more and more like I’ve lost a piece of myself lately. It’s like I forgot who I used to be before I turned 22 I just don’t feel like the same person. I know this is probably a common feeling even outside of depression/anxiety/mental health issues but I just don’t know what happened to the me when I was 19 or even 20. I used to be filled with so much dread,anxiety,frustration, and fear but I was also feeling motivated, brave, bold, and even in my darkest of times I felt hopeful. But now I just don’t know it feels like I’ve shriveled up I’m just nothing like the cinders in a bonfire I grew to unimaginable heights but now I’m blowing away in the wind. 

I just don’t know anymore I don’t know if it’s because my old therapist left for California or because I need to take medication or even because I’m in a very complicated relationship with this girl but I just don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore. Or maybe the problem is I don’t know what’s right anymore it all feels like I’m lost in my own thoughts and I used to be so good at controlling my emotions,figuring out healthy habits to combat it all, and being mindful for myself but now I barely able to hold a conversation without trying to immediately escape it. I squirm and contort to leave the conversation as quickly as it began I just don’t know anymore. 

It all just feels like I burned myself out like a candle lit at both ends I burned so bright and did so well but now it’s just the shriveled wick and remnants of candle wax to mark who I am now. I can still feel emotions too like anger,happiness, sadness, and frustration but I don’t know how to hype myself up or even work my way to actually dealing with them anymore. When I get angry I just let myself explode, when I’m happy I let it run my life without understanding the consequences, when I’m sad I just throw away the realities of the world to hide away in my shell, and when I’m frustrated I yell and kick and scream in the hopes it’ll release the buildup but it never does. I really don’t know what I’m doing anymore it all feels like I’m experiencing the same problems I’ve handled before but this time I know how to fix them but I have no will or motivation to fix them anymore."
3691,i wrote a suicide-ish note today. i’m volunteering at 7 am tomorrow,"the duality of man haha. it’s so ironically funny how my life looks so put together and amazingly successful while i cry and contemplate suicide every night. i’ve tried talking but they don’t want the emotional burden and they gloss over it. no one cares till you kill yourself. no one values or loves me, they’ll forget about me if i die."
3692,Just sharing a bit of what's going on for me,"I feel like my case of despair is mild (I don't want to call it depression as I feel many many others have it worse). I just wanted to try to see if writing my problems in a post will help myself focus more on what matters. I leave out a lot of details to try to keep me anon, and will most likely check on this back in a few days if I can get myself to. I also know it is all over the place(my lack of energy has played a part in this, sorry).

&amp;#x200B;

So I think this would have started back in middle school. I wanted to be into technology so I studied hours a day doing mini projects I kept to myself (from programming, to taking things apart and seeing how they worked). After graduating from high school I started looking for a job in the field because I already knew almost everything, but seeing the job requirements for any sort of technology job made me depressed as I knew that even if I got a degree in a field I wanted student loans would pile up and there was 0 guarantee that I would be working a job like that when I got out (the degree was 154k). Time after time again after being rejected, rejected, rejected, I lost a bit on interest each rejection on doing what I loved doing. I decided to settle for a crappy job that I knew would not get me to a place I wanted just for the money. After over a year in that job the place shut down, I went back to school getting some experience (school wise) doing something I now didn't want to try to do. I passed as you would expect and didn't feel challenged at all as I already knew all of the material. The teacher did I think above average in their job, as even when I knew I had the answer right when called on they made me get it wrong by making me overthink it by saying ""are you sure about that?"" acting like I said the wrong answer when I actually had it right. After the classes (not to that end degree mind you this was all for nothing), I looked for more jobs in the field I kept getting rejected from time after time again. Surprise I got rejected again time after time after time. 

I was literally out of money and living on about $1-2 a day. Wake up, skip breakfast as no money, have maybe a piece of bread with some peanut butter on it on good days, bread with nothing on bad days. This was also for dinner as I had no idea when I would get a single job and gas was running out as I kept getting interviews, but no job. I finally gave up on everything thinking that I felt like dying so I should just die serving my country. Turns out after I think 6 visits (and finding a job I was ok with in the army/marines/airforce) I was denied entry due to issues with my physical body. I was at least semi thankful that the government payed for a few of my meals, but after being denied entry I was on the verge of having no food or gas money. 

I figured if my physical body is so messed up I should just work at a factory where it just should get worse. After getting a job (the first application to a factory), I worked there a bit. One day though on the job(assembly line kinda factory) Someone in management screwed up and put the wrong information on the package labels. Our entire assembly line got fired off that (I had an opportunity to work at a different assembly line that day but decided to stay with the team I at least somewhat knew). I mean I wasn't mad or anything, I was kinda glad I got fired as I could maybe find a job in the field I wanted to get into and the place I worked at had drug dealers/users working there and treated the employees like replaceable tools that have no voice (literally no talking, no music, no anything entertaining). They also broke many different anti-harassment laws as they allow sexual harassment and don't punish those responsible/believe victims of abuse. 

After that job, I decided again I want to try to get into the field I want to get in. Apply, apply, apply, and get rejection, rejection, rejection. It kept feeding my despair, and I found another job that actually wasn't a warehouse/assembly job that used computers(still not what I wanted though, but at least it was better than that factory). I worked through it, and found another short job afterwards. Now I am back at less than 100 in my bank account with little gas living back on $1-2/day for food til I get something. I am refusing to backpedal to get a job I am qualified for that the companies refuse to think I am, but I am not dedicated enough to show a project I have no interest in due to the amount of rejections of companies saying ""yea you like doing this? well gotta spend 154k and 4 more years of your life on classes you know the material of cause this other person did"". Anyways at this point I have nothing going for me, waiting on more rejections/interviews to waste my gas and money. 

I feel like after high school and falling into this state of despair I have started having issues learning/retaining new things. I don't know if this is relevant to my mental state at the moment, but easiest way to describe it is that you read something, and then end up asking yourself ""what did I just read?"" and read it again. Same thing happens when someone is talking with me for a while. I can listen to people talking across the room fine, but listening to someone face to face makes words go over my head and make me say ""can you repeat that please"" or guess that they said. I hear ""talk to your friends"" as an option to deal with depression, but what do I say to people who don't actually want to talk to you? My friends pushed me away a long time ago and refuse to chat with me. It has literally been what feels like years since they wanted to talk to me. Since I am bad at socializing I don't keep up with my past work colleagues, and most of the time they share no interest in what I like doing as the jobs I had don't reflect what I want to do."
3693,Saw a warning sign at the doctor warning that the flu could possible be fatal.,I opted out of my flu shot this year.
3694,People are liars. I guess this is a vent or something.,"They say they will always be there. They never are. They only show up when it makes them look good. If anything ever happens they go well they should have told me or talked to me. They say they tried to help. They are never actually there. I tried to reach out for help. I tried the suggestions. I tried going to the doctor and seeing a therapist. Everyone has written me off time and time again. Oh it's just something you will get over or oh well maybe you just need to keep doing this and that for longer. How long is long enough. For years and years just pushed aside or been told I am faking. 

But whatever."
3695,Losing 99% of my college friends 😭,"So, this is a a very long story. I am a student st this public university on the East Coast. I am in my senior year. Prior to university, I never had friends. I'm an introvert. I was told by several teachers troeing up that I have symptoms of asperger's syndrome. When I entered university, I made my first friend freshmen year at this fun club. Through him, I met this guy who became my best friend until I screwed it up. When sophomore year came, I spent more time with him and his other friends. We used to stay at university for hours talking about our interests in things like history and politics. When junior year came, one of our friends' siblings got into our university. I had a crush on her. Because of my lack of experience, I asked my friends for advice. Problem was that I never took it despite what knowing that I should've. Since I would ask for life advice nonstop to my friends, they got very annoyed. During the summer before sophomore year, I ditched one of my friends just to go to her KBBQ. A few months later, I was depressed because I couldn't stop thinking about her. Around this time, I insulted my friends without realizing it. I used the word ""forced"" as a positive word instead of negative. I insulted one of my friend's girlfriend by saying ""Imagine dating (name)."" I never intended to hurt her feelings. I felt very bad for insulting her. After constantly telling my friends about my feelings and asking for life advice that I never took. The week before Thanksgiving Break, my friends voted to kick me out of the group. Most cut communication ties with me. I was depressed and still am depressed because I lost most of the friends I made over the years. I had suicidal thoughts and want my life to end. I now view myself as the pathetic loser everyone back in elementary and high school called me on a daily basis. The guilt of what I did is eating me alive. I wish my suffering would end. I lost my best friend and all the other friends I made because of my pathetic stupidity that allowed me to lose my way and be controlled by emotions."
3696,I just want to be someones first choice.,"After being told multiple times in the past week or so that all I do is lock myself in my room after work, it finally got to me tonight. Someone brought it up and I just brushed it off saying that I actually had plans with 2 different groups of people tonight and I don't generally go out on week days. Then no one ever hit me up from either group. On top of that my friend I havent seen in years finally came home today and he didn't think to even tell me. I first realized I had depression after my s/o of 2 years left me for someone she had known only for a month, and now I just don't know what to do. It seems that everyone would rather push we away for reasons I can't understand. I'm very good at hiding my depression I think as none of my friends know and I'm generally a positive person around them. But for fucks sake even my own mother would rather get drunk with friends then have a sober dinner with family. Just a bullshit rambling rant but idk I thought it might help. I genuinely hope you are all having a better night then me and I wish the best for all of you. Much love."
3697,Unsure of reality,"Okay I don't know, some days I am unaware of what is real or not is this normal while on medication? Sometimes I forget the day or to feed myself or believe my own lies. I do eventually realise what's happening and real. It's only small lapse of an hour or two on my days off. If it is normal how do you people deal with it?"
3698,Today was bad. And I've got to thinking..,"My dog died. I'm grieving. I feel like I'm in a shadow. I'm looking up, and what do I see? There's a lot of people in my life. A select few that are the most important to me. Family visited my house. What for? Certainly wasn't for me. There was uneasiness. It was apparent I wasn't well. I had to bury my puppy who couldn't survive a illness. He made me happy while he was alive. Even in his final moments, sleeping peacefully whilst fighting for another day he wouldn't see.  

Coming into the house after I said my final goodbye, there are eyes on me. No words were shared. I put up a smile. Knowing well that no one would tell me what I would want to hear. No condolences. I tell myself ""I'm going to be okay"" I tell the one I shared the news to, that I'm going to be okay. But the conversation diverts to them after. I don't want to come across as selfish, so I gave them my attention. I gave a lot of people my attention, helping them out at times. No attention onto me. 

I know I've been through a lot. But I didn't have tears to spare this day. Mind going over and over processing everything. I'm not just thinking about my dog, I'm thinking about my worth. How much do I mean. Am I an idiot for not telling everyone what happened. I didn't want to in the end. I didn't want to. Had so many people I could reach. Felt like my troubles weren't worth it, because I didn't want a pity party. No matter how much I wanted to say something. 

This is the loneliest I've been in a long time. This, during some of the most uplifting times of my life right now. I'm so fucked today that I'm even staring blank at the screen, wall, or floor, letting everything sink in. Wish certain people were there for me. I knew they wouldn't be. 

I'm a mess. Regardless of that, I want to show love to people. That's all I fucking did. Even if they didn't show love to me back. I'm falling apart. All I do is give. And when I try to open up, I feel like I'm an eye sore. Like people don't want to hear that from me. They just want to move past that kind of topic quickly. 

I don't know what to do anymore."
3699,Why don’t you understand,"Yesterday and today were bad days for me.. first I get yelled at because I thought the room we are building in the new house was kinda small (I’ve been stuck in a trailer since 5th grade..I’m in 11th now) I was freaking out because I want my space. My mom called me entitled because the room will also have its own bathroom and walk in closet. (Maybe I am entitled..I’m sorry) 

Later mother freaked out because I wasn’t that hungry when she made me spaghetti (she was almost done with it when I walked in from school) but to make her happy I went to get some and she snatched the bowl out of my hand and pushed me back. I’m sorry..

She called me an entitled ass and screamed at me while I laid in my bed not wanting to argue with her. 

Today I accidentally slept late and missed my bus. My father yelled at me because of it. He than told me that I was entitled too. He said I didn’t want to be here (he moved us to a giant piece of rural land in a 4 wheel trailer so he could build a house) I do miss my friends and I do miss having people around me..I’m not fitting in so good at the new school too..but who cares as my dad said..I probably won’t see these people once I graduate. I told him I wanted to leave to my room while he was lecturing me and he accused me of “wanting him to fail at building a house” why would you even say that? Of course I don’t want you to fail. 

These past two days I’ve had the strongest urge to kill myself..my boyfriend from my old school(we moved 30 mins away) is the only thing keeping me alive. My parents won’t let me see him tomorrow tho. It’s my fault. 

I’m sorry I make mistakes..I’m sorry I’m going through teenage angst..

I don’t know if I can’t do this anymore 

I love my bf but I feel he can get over me..he can find someone to make him happy again..I’m sorry 

I’m losing it"
3700,No win situation,How’s that for a generic ass title? Really fits with this whole attention whore thing I got going on right now. I’m posting more dumb shit on the internet because I think it’s gonna help. Yep. I’m that desperate folks. Now I’m really considering sticking a knife in my arm. Right by the veins. Not sure why. I know my friends are gonna see it if I do. They’re gonna worry about me like always. They’re gonna want to help but as always I’m not gonna get any fuckin better. It’s like I get off on this shit man. A while back my parents told me I don’t wanna get better and for once they were fuckin right. Great. Fuckin beautiful. They’re getting the last laugh in all this. I did everything I possibly could to rise above them and be better. But in the end they fucking won. And they’re gonna blame everyone but themselves as always. My friends are gonna have to carry the weight of not being able to save me. Fucking awesome. The people who tried their fucking hearts out to help me are gonna be fucked over emotionally and financially by me finally getting the balls to throw myself away. I just want to stop feeling it all. I want it to be over even if there’s nothing after I’m dead. I know i won’t be able to enjoy the peace. There’s no good ending here. Either i keep pushing forward and keep feeling worse or I end it all and cease existing. I won’t even get to feel at ease after it’s over. Everyone suffers no matter what. Fuck everything.
3701,Future,"Thinking about how my family would never accept me having a relationship. I’ve been single all of my life and my family looks down on me for it. They don’t realize that I am truly gay and will never come out to them. I’m just thinking about how they would never accept my relationship with a man when that day come. It’s not like I plan on having a relationship soon but as I started watching Youtube videos, the thought came to me. I won’t give them a future that they want or just a normal future that is expected. I just feel down on myself for being this way knowing there’s no way to change it. I didn’t choose this but it is what it is, I guess. I am forcing myself to disconnect myself from them, emotionally and physically, when I get the chance. I hope one day I find love but I know it will come at a price. Feel so stupid living like this."
3702,I don’t know how to help him,"My (26F)  boyfriend (21M) and I lived together and we got really behind on rent and chose to leave and live with friends temporarily until we get some money saved. After that we both got extremely depressed and both suicidal (he had planned to kill himself on Thanksgiving). I went to the ER and had myself admitted. 
Since I’ve been out and back on my meds I’ve felt great. The depression has been super low and I actually feel happy. My boyfriend and I are communicating so much better and having good conversations. It feels like when we first started dating. 
But then last night I get a text his car had been stolen. As it turned out it was repoed because he had gotten three months behind. He was so upset and said he had nothing now. No home, no job, no income, and no car. He said he was going to kill himself and I believed he would. When he stopped responding I didn’t know what else to do. I don’t know where he lives so I called his roommate at his work  (who I have issues with) and told him. His roommate knew and acted like it was nothing and said “well I’ll be home in thirty minutes”. 

My boyfriend had not hurt himself. I kept my phone on Incase he needed me and fell asleep. I get a text at 1:45am saying he was scared of his roommate. His roommate got mad that he hadn’t cleaned the kitchen and hadn’t got him something from the store. My boyfriend was saying he was afraid to go to sleep and was saying that his friend is so much bigger than him and could easily overpower him. I offered to pick him up and he said no. He said he was okay sleeping there and was just going to wait until his roommate was asleep first. 

So today I hadn’t heard anything. I knew he ended up going to bed after 4am so I waited a while. At 5pm I was so worried I called him. He asked for me to leave him alone and he just wanted to sleep. I voiced how I was afraid and didn’t hear anything for a few hours. When I finally got a response he told me one of his friend had killed himself. I offered to pick him up again and told him I didn’t want him to be alone. He got crazy upset again and said I wasn’t respecting what he wanted. A few more hours pass and he was talking to me normal and I told him about my doctors visit today. 

I should’ve just left it alone but I voiced all my concerns. How I was scared for him. How I was afraid his roommate would hurt him and how his roommate is not stable. He got really upset again. I told him he had options and my friend (who I am staying with) and her husband have opened up there house to him because they are also concerned with his situation. He said I was irritating him just like his other friend  (who is probably really concerned like I am). He said he was going to block me. The last thing he said was he couldn’t stand how irritating I was because I wasn’t respecting him. And then he blocked me. 

He just now responded back and said he can’t believe how disrespectful I was being and how it’s like I want him to kill himself. He then said he needs to figure out how to do it. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to help him. I do not feel comfortable with him staying there at all. I already didn’t but even more so now. I am so heartbroken. I said everything really kindly and he just got upset and blocked me. How can I help him realize that situation isn’t good for him? That it’s making his depression worse and that he needs to get out? I am so worried and anxious I’m making myself sick over it.  

TLDR: Boyfriend afraid of roommate. I try to help and he gets upset and blocks me. I don’t know how to help him realize this is a bad situation."
3703,On top of my depression I think I may have agoraphobia,"I've had depression for so long that I don't remember what it was like before. I spend most of my time alone at home. It's not that I never leave the house, I leave the house almost every day for some reason, maybe to go shopping, see my psychiatrist or, more rarely, see friends. But I don't leave the house for long and the longer I'm away from home the more anxious I get. The thought of leaving my city fills me with dread. And I live in a small city, it's almost more like a town.

I went to stand-up show tonight, the show was funny but being in a room full of people I didn't know made me so uncomfortable. When I go outside I'm afraid of other people, strangers. But I'm also afraid of running into people I know and having to talk to them. Sometimes I deliberately avoid places where I know friends and acquaintances might be because I'm afraid that they'll want to talk to me."
3704,The only time I’m at peace is when I’m asleep but I can’t sleep because when I’m laying down and it’s dead silent is when I start thinking the most,It’s so infuriating being tired all day and then every single night being up for a couple hours because I can’t control my thoughts and all I can think about is how fucking shitty I am how do I make it stop
3705,Not sure where to go from here,"Sitting here on my couch recovering from surgery. I was drunk and on pain meds yesterday and sent nudes to a guy I only knew one day, completely embarrassed myself. Not sure how I completely lack social skills and do shit like this. I’m sure he thinks I’m an absolute basketcase. I truly feel fucking empty inside. When will I learn to like myself and not embarrass myself. Yes I can laugh at myself but I do want to be able to talk to ppl of the opposite sex in a healthy way.  I’ve worn this crazy girl facade so long I’m not sure how to escape it"
3706,Can you see a therapist if you're an alcoholic?,"Honest question. I've been thinking about seeing a therapist again but a few years back I went somewhere and after the intake survey they said they couldn't take me because of my drinking habits. I tried googling for an answer but all I found was 'stop drinking therapy', not the 'unload my thoughts on a professional therapist' I'm looking for"
3707,I think that’s it for me,I can’t live with the fact that I’m a failure anymore. I’ll be dead after tonight. Good luck to you all
3708,What's it like to be unaware of your feelings,"What's it like to not know why you feel how you feel about any particular feeling? I've heard multiple people say this before. I don't understand the concept of not understanding why you feel how you feel about something. For example, for me, if I feel something bad, it's because of a very clear and concise reason. I don't like you because you did something which made me not like you. Another example could be ""This car makes me feel sick BECAUSE it's very bumpy""  
Every feeling has a reason, as far as I understand. How can you not know why you feel how you feel?"
3709,My therapist asked me if I loved myself...,"""Without thinking about your skills, or all of the things you've accomplished. Do you love yourself?""

And I just...shrugged...then said no...then broke down. 

I've accomplished a hell of a lot. I'm a first generation college student from a single parent home. My dad was too much into his addictions to ever pay child support for his four children. But I made it anyways. 

Then I travelled all over the world, even lived in other countries for a bit. My student loans are paid off, and now that I'm back in my home country I'm working on my masters with a career goal in mind. I'm also working a job I love and unlike a lot of my peers in my area I can afford to live on my own. 

I have a bunch of random skills. I'm a great performer, I cook well, I am great at making things with my hands. I'm also pretty charismatic, due to my extroverted nature. I get compliments on these skills often. 

But I'm still so depressed. I'm dealing with trauma, and just the general feeling that I'm not enough. I feel like I have to show off my skills or talk myself up, or no one will like me. I've felt this way ever since I was young. And so yesterday my therapist helped me really come to the realization that I just don't love myself. I've been reflecting and crying ever since.

I don't make friends based on their skills and accomplishments. I just love them for them, and I love them so strongly. So why am I so hard on myself? How do I even begin to love myself? Especially since I want so badly to feel loved by others?"
3710,Anxiety &amp; Loneliness Are Destroying My Life,"Hello people of Reddit,

I hope you all are well, and ideally you're doing much better than I am now.  I'm writing this because I want to warn others to the dangers of social isolation, and I hope that there may be someone who could give me advice for my current situation.  

As you can read from title, I am dealing with as bad as it gets social anxiety and, because of that, crushing loneliness.  Anyway, a couple of weeks ago was my 20th birthday, and I spent it alone.  The only contact I had was a call from my parents who think I'm doing just fine and several calls from a few good friends from back home (I'm in my sophomore year of college currently pretty far away from my home city), which made more of a difference than they could know.  It didn't bother me much on my birthday as I spend most days alone, but, today, it hit me just how alone and pathetic my life is at the moment and how much of a pit I have sunken into.  I don't completely know what point I'm trying to make, and I don't want this to be super long, but the only advice I can give is to put yourself into as many possible social situations as you can or at least a couple every day.  For me, the self-inflicted process of social isolation began 5 or 6 years ago, and I wrote myself off as being anti-social in the beginning.  Gradually, and I didn't realize it as time slipped by, I have gone from occasionally giving an excuse to friends to not play basketball (when I was 14) to having no friends and no one to even talk with.  I know that sounds corny as hell, but goddamn does it make me sad.  I don't know what to do, and these problems that surround me now are problems that in hindsight I clearly brought upon myself.  But because of how bad my social anxiety is now I struggle to even make smalltalk, never mind actual lasting friendship.  I don't know what to do, and I have never EVER felt suicidal because I think everyday of the pain that would cause my family, but I have reached a threshold that, even though I'm so conditioned to spend days on my own, I cannot handle.  I feel as though I am slowly withering away, and again I just don't know what to do about it.  I have good days where I exercise, and I chat with people on the bus, and I get all my work done without procrastinating, but they are becoming more seldom.  If anyone has any advice, I'd be more than happy to take it.  Thank you for reading if you got this far.  I am REALLY trying to get myself out there, but it is so draining to even participate in the smallest social interactions for me, and I am close to losing any sliver of hope. :("
3711,Why cant people just hate me more?,"I just want them to push me away, and see me for a terrible and disgusting thing. It would make me extremely relieved and maybe even happy. It's a weird thing to want and idk why? If I'm thinking these things, does it mean I deserve it? Did I don't something unforgivable? Idk what I did, but I feel like I should sometimes be killed for  just existing. If people were to hate me, then I could avoid the possibility of mentally harming them from venting to them. They say they're ok with listening but I know they suffer and hate to hear it. 

WHY DONT YOU JUST GET RID OF ME ALREADY?!!!

IM NOT EVEN WORTH BEING AROUND SO WHY DO YOU!!??!

STOP HANGING AROUND ME!! 

IM UNSTABLE AND I DONT WANT TO BE A NUISANCE OR A DEPRESSANT TO YOU!!!!

3712,I’m sorry,"I’m sorry I’m such a screw up. 

I’m sorry I’m going through my teenage angst. 

I’m sorry I cry too much.

I’m sorry I over slept today and missed the bus. 

I’m sorry I make mistakes.

I’m sorry I want to kill my self.

I’m sorry it’s hard for me to talk to you. 

Im sorry"
3713,Good news,"I regularly join and leave this group depending how I’m feeling.. Coz it can be too much at times.. anyone got any positive reddit threads to follow? Like good news and random acts of kindness.. 

Thought I’d quickly ask while I’m feeling good, before the big sads return lol"
3714,Continuously oof,It’s really weird to be sad but to also do everything right toward it. Like I’m depress? I go for a walk or I watch a movie or I reach out to a friend or I see my therapist. I’m at the point where I’ve done those so many times that I’m tired of them. I just cannot handle these feelings and I don’t know what to do . And I feel like I drain people’s happiness with my stuff. It’s a big oof.
3715,Crazy,It’s crazy that there’s people who live without feeling like the world is weighing down on them every second of the day. They just exist?? Like they don’t even think about it they just do it cause that’s obviously the normal thing to do. Wow.
3716,"Struggling with Anxiety, it’s starting to disrupt my life.","Hello, I’ve struggled with anxiety all my life but I think I’ve been doing okay coping with it. However, I recently gotten a job in the medical field as a customer service representative for billing. I was a bit overwhelmed at first because it’s my first adult job and the first system I ever learned. It was a tough week and a half but I finally felt like I got the hang of it and was even answering calls myself. Everything went down hill Thursday morning. I felt extremely ill and ended going home and missing Friday because of my illness. It came out of nowhere and I’m upset about it. The reason I feel upset about it was because Thursday was suppose to be more training on the phones and for me to ask anymore questions I had. I didn’t have a chance to train, and Friday two workers has the day off so it was suppose to be me and one other girl. I feel awful because I basically left her on her own for being sick which doesn’t sit well with me. I’m absolutely freaking out about Monday because I don’t know if I’m still training or I’m gonna be left in the phones by myself, I don’t feel ready. I don’t know what to expect. Being sick and having anxiety does not mix.  I can’t even relax right now and I’m pretty sure it’s making my illness worse, I feel numb, shaky and a tightness in my chest. What can I do to calm myself and give my mind some peace? I’d appreciate some advice!"
3717,Can’t sleep again so here’s this I guess.,"Yee haw I’m putting a thing about how fucked up my life is on reddit. So this is where I’m at I guess. Not sure why I’m doing this. But whatever here it is. I’m not sure I’m gonna be around for much longer. I’m a selfish cunt for even considering killing myself. That would financially fuck over my roommates who have been more of a family to me than my real family ever has been. But here we are I’m still fuckin thinking about it. Every single night I weigh the pros and cons of it all ( because there’s totally upsides to killing myself I guess ) I feel like such a fucking moron for thinking about it as hard as I am. Clearly it’s a bad decision right? Then why the fuck am I really really thinkin about it? Maybe it’s because I’m a pathetic little shit who can’t handle life. Something goes wrong at the new job? BOOM I wanna die. Not sure what I wanna do with my life? BOOM I wanna die. Family’s makin the holidays stressful again? BOOM I wanna die. Can’t deal with medication side effects for a couple days? BOOM I wanna fucking die. I don’t get how I can’t handle this kinda thing. I’m supposed to be strong right? I’m the first one in my family to move out and try to make a life for myself. That’s gotta mean something right? Plot twist: it doesn’t mean dick. I got lucky that I made it as far as I did. And with how many dumb decisions I make on an hourly basis I’m only proving that this was all some fluke in the cycle. Regardless I made it to my goal right? Yeah I suppose I did, now what? Oh what a fucking surprise I didn’t think this far ahead, that’s a new one for me. So now I’ve got the dead end. There’s literally no where else to go. Any old nonsensical fantasies I had over the years are beyond impossible. Not to mention they were flawed from inception. Oh what’s that? You wanna be a screenwriter? You wanna do something creative with your existence? WELL GUESS WHAT NEEDLE DICK, you need a bit a talent for that shit. You need to be smarter for that shit. You need to have the drive for that. And you aren’t fucking built for it. You simply aren’t. You tricked yourself for years into thinking you might’ve had something worth saying. You pretentious cocksucking piece of trash. And then add onto it that you’re so fucking over dramatic with your bullshit problems. Oh boo fuckin hoo your family doesn’t like your sexual orientation. People put up with real problems every damn day and this is seriously what you’re complaining about? This is what hurts you? Fuckin pussy. Grow a spine and stop taking the focus off those who deserve it. You’re an attention whore. You’re problems aren’t problems you’re just butthurt over dumb shit and you need other to pity you. You’re a fucking fake piece of shit. And that of course plays into another one of the many many things wrong with you. You don’t want to get help. You have access to psychiatrists and a therapist yet you put off going again and again because you just want to have some issues to whine about. If you actually wanted to get better you’d be booking appointments. Not sitting on your ass like the lazy Piece ofShit you are. You saw the bill you fucking asshole. $325 a visit. Thats how much they’re paying for you to waste their time. You’re not gonna get any better because you don’t want to. You’re gonna keep dragging everyone down. Stop making this hard on them. The meds, the appointments, everything. Nothing works for you. You just get worse and worse. You’re determined to fuck everyone over. Fuck you. Eventually they’re all gonna leave you and it’s gonna be your fucking fault. You’re gonna end up alone. And you deserve it. And now you’ve fucked up tomorrow already by staying up late writing this dumb bullshit. Nice fuckin job jackass."
3718,Literally what is the benefit of being an introvert,"Yeah they all say introverts are better listeners, they are observant, they're thoughtful, etc. Fuck that bullshit. It all just sound like sorry comforting words for introverts to me. Extroverts can be just as thoughtful, observant, and good of a listener if they just try to be. I think it's time for people to admit that introversion is a significant disadvantage and a curse. Just consider this: how many introverts do you think wish they were extroverted? Tons. Meanwhile, how many extroverts do you think wish they were introverted?"
3719,Im falling apart,"I’m trying so hard to keep myself together but honestly I just can’t do this anymore, I feel so defeated. Im so sorry."
3720,I am afraid,"I am very afraid of life, right now I think about all this and I do not find answers and I do not have the courage to help me, I am afraid to live and I feel that I am eventually rotting from the inside. In my mind and in my heart, I feel damaged, and my mentality is so different from my age, I don't want to grow seriously I hate to go forward and spend years and grow old I hate it a lot, I don't want to be big, I don't want to turn 18 I do not want anything that comes just want to be at peace, I really doubt very much if I deserve these ugly thoughts of me and my life, I woke up this morning crying and I feel like this again and I will go to bed crying until I fall asleep . Because I don't like my reality, I am very frustrated about all this, I feel deeply alone, even though I am around so many people. It is one of the happiest times of the year and I don't feel like I thought it would be several months ago. I am disgusted when I have anxiety outbursts and at the same time I am afraid of being alone in one of them because several months ago I was physically hurting and taking pills and I left it in oblivion when I returned to be with someone and promised not to return to that . I don't hurt myself or anything like that, but I still feel like I've given myself hundreds of cuts in my chest, I feel so dissatisfied with everything, I don't like anything and the little I like gets out of hand. I don't hate my life at all, but I don't want to live it, I'm afraid to live and take risks, I just want to leave"
3721,I need someone.,"Everybody hates me EVERYBODY!
My parents, my so called friends..
And more to that nothing is working out for me..
My goals, dreams.. I'm a loser.
I want to kill myself but I just don't have the guts to do it.. I wanted to live of course. 
But the pain is too much to bear anymore.... 
This community is the only way I can vent out my thoughts into.

I need someone to talk to about this... But apparently everyone seems to repel me in my life
I'm useless, unworthy, selfish, and just a bad human being.
Thanks to whoever who took the time to read this post.
God bless you all."
3722,“Everything with you is so heavy”,"The amount of times I’ve been told this. 

I don’t try to come off this way. I haven’t had a lot of light and happy times in my life. Maybe I focus on that too much. 

I also know that I am depressed. I’m not being “heavy” on purpose. I have a mental illness."
3723,Repetitive,"I keep posting and deleting and I don’t know why. I’m not looking for attention, but maybe I’m looking for acknowledgement? I’m at a point where I’m out with friends and the whole time I’m in the corner zoning out because I don’t have the energy to keep up this facade. It hurts to try to smile and it fucking just sucks."
3724,What a terrible decade.,"For the amount of times I hear people say they are thankful about the decade being such a life changer it only reminds me how my entire life went to fucking shit and how I never felt worse. I lost almost everything that gave my life meaning and direction and turned everyone that gave a shit about me away without realizing it until it was too late. I just wish to die before the end of the year but I know it won't happen, I'm too much of a coward to do it myself and God isn't merciful enough to put me out of my misery already because I know I'm miserable. Everyone does yet I'm still around thinking it will get a little better but it won't."
3725,Depression causes heartbreak causes suicidal tendencies,"My depression caused me to really humble myself, put others before me, to try to be a better person and treating everyone fairly. It caused me to realize that since no one knows what goes on with me behind closed doors than idk what goes on with others. Making others happy brings me my own happiness. So when I date, it’s all about them, I treat them the best and do whatever I can, I also learned to never fight with my S/Os and to talk things out maturely. I feel like my depression makes me a really vulnerable person and people can see that, in the beginning of my relationships I’m told “you’re so nice I’m so lucky to have you” but that turns into me being used, or men thinking because I’m soft they can get away with anything. I am always the one who gets heartbroken and it causes me to spiral to thoughts about death. I feel worthless and my friends who don’t get my depression tell me “life isn’t about dating” “you’ll get over it” “you’re better than him” “don’t think about being in a relationship” but I only get into them once in a while and I’m always hurt over it. The pain is so deep because I feel like I get taken advantage of. How do others deal with heartbreak and depression because my past heartbreaks are always on my mind and I can’t be like a “normal” person who parties the pain away or goes out because I’m extremely introverted and would rather stay home and think about dying..."
3726,I cant tell if I'm sensitive or just depressed,"I cant tell if I'm overly sensitive or if I'm being dramatic but I've been suicidal for a couple months now and right it seems to be getting worse and worse . And my parents font sen to help I try to talk to them about my problems and they use it against me or call me snowflake or weak. If I say anything back its disrespect . My mom complains that she thinks she has depression idk when I say I'm feeling low she says it's because I don't pray or etc


I cant tell what's going on I've been passively thinking about sucide . I remember it got bad and it was out of the blue too . My brain just repeated "" I want to die "" over and over 


Idk I've been thinking about it I do want to live and it is going to get better and iam going to get away from my parents but I can see distrust in them . Disappointment


Right now I've been thinking about taking pills to maybe end it or atleast a mild coma but I know if I wake up the amount of shame the family would have and they would hound me about it forever .


I just want it to stop"
3727,I Feel So Alone,"Nobody listens to me, and when they do they don’t take me seriously. I always end up crying myself to sleep because I have nobody to talk to. 

Everyone treats me like their words and actions don’t faze me. But they do, when my friends laughed at me because I didn’t get a question right in math class, it hurt. When my mom sighed in the middle of her sentence and said “never mind I’m just gonna go to bed” because she assumed I wouldn’t understand, it hurt. 
There’s nobody to vent to, because everyone treats me like that, like I’m stupid, not smart enough to have feelings. I just don’t know what to do about it anymore."
3728,Mehhhh,"I dont wanna try meds, the nurse prescribed me some but honestly I dontvgive a shit anymore really. Why should I feel happy in this world when society is absolute dogshit. Plus if medication makes me worse off it wont be good , idk man .

I actually dont care that I'll end up forever alone anymore. I dont care I have 0 friends or have never been in a relationship.  I'm fine by myself because no one else can handle me lmao I'm too fcked.

 I honestly just wanna go live cheap as fuck and live a life escaping that 9-5 rat race man. Fuck college and fuck putting an effort into life. I do feel lazy I dont have energy for college or any more jobs. I gotta figure out a way how to live super cheap , might just invest into a van and move far away one day idk."
3729,Breathing exercises.,"Welll.... seems like the stuff therapy has shown me actually works. Was about to leave work and a coworker had their first full blown anxiety attack. I sat with them and did the things therapy has shown me and it actually calmed them down after about 40 minutes of working with them and keeping them focus on the breathing and focus on what they see in the room. I've been going to therapy for about 10 years for my depression and anxiety and always thought the breathing exercises and focusing on what is around you and name what you see and how many items you see was stupid. But, it worked for my coworker when I sat with them and helped get them calmed down. To those that read this and think therapy is stupid and what they show is stupid... from seeing it first hand and using it on someone that needed the help... it actually helps. Sorry for the format, I'm on mobile."
3730,I think I’m finally broken.,"I’ve dealt anxiety and depression for a long time.    But it’s never been this bad.

I tried to go to a therapist, and a psychiatrist for medication earlier this year, but it was too expensive even with insurance. The stress of the cost made my anxiety worse.

All I want to do is sleep. I don’t put on makeup. I don’t shower unless I have to. I haven’t done laundry in months. My clothes sit in a clean pile or a dirty pile. 

I’m 40,000 in student loan debt. 8,000 in credit card debt. 8,000 in car debt because my car was stolen last year so I had to get a new one. I’m making 46k a year and will never be out of debt. 

I’ll never be able to travel. I’m almost 30 and I’ve never left the states. I probably never will. 

At this point I doubt I’ll have kids. I can’t afford it. One big emergency would put me on the street. I have 1 month’s rent in savings. 

I have an English degree that I wish I could use, but no one will hire me and I have no experience and no portfolio. 

All I do is sleep. I can’t focus. I can’t cry. I find myself conversing with someone and wanting to walk away in the middle of it - I just don’t care and don’t have the energy to even respond. 

I used to be so articulate and well spoken. Now I’m always struggling for words, trailing off, being awkward. 

I used to be loud and funny. I used to be good at everything. I was so motivated. I’ve always worked so hard. 

Now I’m just tired. I don’t want to kill myself because I couldn’t do that to my mom or siblings or bf or loved ones. And I’ll die eventually anyway, I guess. 

I’m going to be stuck here forever. Unhappy. Working and sleeping. One day I’ll wake up and be 70 and wonder what the point of this stupid shitty life was? So I could work the entire time and never have interests, learn skills, see the world? 

I don’t fucking get it. What is the point of this shit life? I’m losing it. 9-5 M-F. I’m not even making enough to survive. 

I just want to sleep. Sometimes I fantasize about being in a bad car accident, just so I could sleep, guilt-free, in the hospital. 

Idk what the point of this is. I’m numb and don’t want to tread water like this for the next 50 years."
3731,I should be feeling happy!!! WTF IS WRONG WITH ME!!,"I'm like seriously about to cry. I know I have 3 depressive disorders but I don't understand. I just got out for winter break, and I've started doing some hobbies again. I've been drawing, making videos and insta edits. Reading is still difficult but I've been remembering my shower schedule and trying not to forget it. But I just don't feel happy or satisfied!! WTF. Every time someone tells me my drawings are really good I'm like ""No it's not. It's shit. Look at x,y and z"" and I know they're actually pretty good I just can't see them that way. 

Maybe it's my PMDD Idk. I have been more ..irritable lately..which is another thing that pisses me off. I can't always noticed when I'm sounding rude or angry. (But sometimes I can catch myself) and my parents are like ""Why do you have to be so rude!?"" Or ""She's PMSing again"" BITCH. THIS IS BEYOND PMSING. 

I just want to know what it's like to feel normal. But I'm scared to talk to my psychiatrist about getting a service dog because my he may not see it as debilitating. I know there are people out there who feel worse than me but I feel like

""What's happening?"" 
""Why don't I feel better? I'm doing the things they tell me to do!"" 
""Why isn't it working?"" 
""Why am I like this?"" 

I also don't like when people think I'm ungrateful. I'm not. I just...don't know how to express that emotion very well. My family gets mad when I say ""Thank you"" because it's not ""OMFG NDNDJD THIS IS THE BEST THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOVE IT."" So Christmas is going to kill my soul. 

Also I've been having bouts of insomnia and waking insomnia, so fun."
3732,I don't know what to do anymore.,"I don't know what to do with myself anymore, or how to push through life. I've had depression for the last 9 years, and the last two years have been the worst of it. I've tried over 30 medications, ketamine treatments, and recently ECT. Nothing seems to work for me, and I have become completely hopeless. I have a therapist, and am in group therapy as well. But I'm so exhausted and unmotivated to try any coping skills anymore. I tried to kill myself over a year ago, and ever since then I feel like a switch has flipped in my brain and I can't see things with any kind of hope or positivity. Nothing makes me feel any positive emotion. I just don't want a life, it is so unappealing and it gives me a lot of anxiety to think about. The last few months have been the most painful, and all I can think about is killing myself. My self hatred is at rock bottom, and I feel its impossible for me to have any kind of self compassion. I feel so alone, I have my family, but other than that the only friend I have lives across the country from me. It feels overwhelming to talk to people, and I just keep closing in on myself. I haven't been able to work, and everytime I have tried to go back to college I end up not being able to push through it. I feel like I have just been wasting my life away, and I can't stand the thought of having to do this any longer. I feel like everything just keeps getting worse and worse. I just can't find a single reason to live, and I think if I wasn't scared of death I would already be dead. I just am so sick of feeling this pain day after day."
3733,Anxiety and depression affecting my cognitive function,"I have had terrible anxiety my whole life. But as I’ve got older (I’m 30) it has just become worse. I’ve always loved school and loved to learn and recently received a master degree 2 years ago.  But I’ve noticed lately that my cognitive function is declining. Very frequently I’m asking myself “why did I say that?” Or “why did I do that” “I can’t believe I made that mistake”. It’s happening all too often. I legitimately feel like I’m SO DUMB. I feel so scatterbrained. I can’t stay organized or focus or get motivated. Can anxiety/depression make you dumber? Can you seriously affect your learning skills and decision making? 

Also, can you have depression and not realize it? Does anxiety and depression go hand and hand?

Please tell me I’m not alone and what you have done to sharpen your brain."
3734,My transgender friend is suicidal. What do I do?,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend, who is suicidal, and has said to me multiple times that she ""Wants everyone to leave me alone so I can kill myself."" This friend constantly tries to push me away, and push other people away. These are people who are trying to be helpful, and supportive. What do you do when someone simply wants to end their own life? What do you do when someone is not responsive to support. My friend constantly says ""I'm a sociopath"", ""I'm a bad person"", ""I hate everything about myself."" And when I say ""I love everything about you, except that you try to push all of us away."" She gets sad. How do I help this person? I don't know what to do. We are both in the United States, so mental health care is not covered. She literally cannot see a therapist. She also seems to be very bad with expressing thoughts and emotions (probably because she is constantly high on obscene amounts of Marijuana).  Sadly, I have no way of contacting this person anymore."
3735,180 Kind of Day,"I woke up and was in an okay mood. I don't know what happened but at about 10:45 am I got very depressed and anxious. I wanted to jump out of my skin and run away. I left work during my lunch break, got myself a bottle of water at the 7-11 across the street, and got a minute of fresh air. I didn't feel great the rest of the day. I was overwhelmed with work (three fights breaking out in the afternoon, a ton of paper work to do, observations/guest visitors all week, and lack of sleep) so I just kept to myself, trying to keep my head down and do my job. When I got home, I ate some cheese and crackers while I was in bed, surfing the web. I was exhausted and wanted to go to bed at 9.

Here is the problem: My best friend is in town. He lives 2,500 miles away. I haven't seen him since May, We have had plans for tomorrow for a month. I promised myself that I would get my next week's lesson plans done today all week so I wouldn't have to do it tomorrow/Sunday. I know i will not be in any shape to do them then due to the crying when he leaves and the hangover I will have. I did not want to do them whatsoever. My anxiety/mood was bad and I was three quarters asleep.

I turned on some music, worked for two and a half hours on them, and got them done. I was on such a roll that I started to clean. I wiped down all surfaces, picked up the floor, took out the trash, did dishes, swept, vacuumed, and cleaned out my purse. The basic little things. I had really been struggling to get everything done with my recent depression episode and haven't moved out of my bed except to go to work for weeks. Today I managed to get not only my lesson plans done but also the cleaning that I have neglected to do for weeks.

I am so proud of myself. I did a complete 180. I was going to give up and go to sleep. I was productive. Do I feel the greatest right now? Absolutely not. But I fought through it, was productive and got stuff done, and I haven't been able to do that for weeks. So it is a major win in my book!"
3736,I'm not sure I can take life much longer,"It started about two and a half years ago, I was working hard in college, had my anxiety mostly under control, and was even starting to feel a bit happy. I had made friends I truly loved, and felt loved by people in my life for the first time in probably ever. Then I began to experience derealization. I just woke up one day, and it no longer felt like my body was mine. I struggled in social settings in ways I never had before, and could hardly find it in myself to leave my apartment. I almost got kicked out of my program due to this, until eventually things started to settle. I learned to deal with what I was experiencing, and slowly started to get back to being me. But I never truly felt like myself again, that happiness I had found with friends and roommates, it was gone. I just felt empty again like I had so many times before, only now instead of a bad week or day, it was never ending. This emptiness, coupled with the constant feelings of discomfort in my own skin were too much to handle. I started drinking heavily, and slowly fell into alcoholism. I got a job at a bar to help support my habit, and eventually wound up spending every night on my kitchen floor, or passed out on a public street, too drunk to stand up or make it home. I figured if I never felt ok anyways, if I felt like life wasn't real, then why not be drunk the whole time? At least then things would feel wrong for reasons I could control, at least then I could laugh again. My degree was at risk, and though somehow I managed to keep the job, I lost friends and roommates, stopped speaking to almost everyone, and turned into a shell of myself. 

This was the point I attempted suicide again.

I took a whole bottle of pain pills I had been prescribed for a bad burn I had gotten about a year prior, and passed out in my bathroom. The one roommate who stayed with me through all of this found me, and managed to get me to a hospital before it was too late. I'm sad to say I resent him for it. I really wanted to die. I wanted to be me again but the person I was no longer existed in who I had become. I was under watch for 2 weeks, and somehow didn't lose my job or get kicked out of school. I never told my parents any of this, partially to protect them, partially out of fear they'd come visit. Slowly I began to pick up the pieces, I remained an alcoholic though I got better at hiding my depression. I went to classes drunk, I missed others because I was hungover, and probably never went to a shift without 3-4 drinks under my belt. Life had become a blur, and I'd be lying if I said I remembered much of it. 

But then something clicked in me one year before I was set to graduate, and I started to work towards bettering myself. I curbed my drinking, I got promoted at work because I finally showed some initiative, and even began to form relationships with the friends I had drifted away from again. I'm certain it was my sisters fiancee's suicide that made this change in me. I saw her cry like I never had before, and realized I needed to be better for her, to be the brother she deserved, rather than another body for her to bury.

I worked my ass off for that whole year, I took every shift I could, and was working 6 days a week while not only taking full time courses, but three extra classes to make up for ones I had failed. And I did it, even with less than 4 hours of sleep a night, even with a thesis to write I did it. And graduated just this May. I was finally back to where I was 2 years ago, I was happy, I had friends who loved me, and I had a smile on my face that wasn't fueled by drugs or alcohol. I was as close to myself as I could've ever hoped to be.

And then I got sick. 

My heart went crazy, like it was trying to jump out of my chest and I passed out. The next week was spent in a hospital trying to diagnose what happened. I was hooked up to machines, monitors, oxygen, the whole nine yards. And found out I had a severe case of pericarditis, with complications that were causing irregular heart rhythms. Essentially the flu virus had infected the sac around my heart, and was causing it to both swell with liquid, and beat irregularly. I cried every night in that hospital bed, wondering why it had to happen now, why when I had finally made it back to myself. I was stuck in the hospital for another week, for fear of potential heart failure, and when I was released was told due to the severity it would take around 4 weeks before I was back to normal functioning levels. I had to quit my job, and was forced to move back home, a whole province away, to be supported by my parents while I recovered. 

In one moment all my work was taken away from me. I lost the apartment I loved, most of my belongings as I couldn't afford to ship them, and no longer have the support group of friends I had made over the last year. The life I had spent so long building, had lost, and regained were gone forever. Now I sit here, alone in my childhood bedroom every day, wondering if there's any point in life anymore. It seems like every time I build myself back up, the world finds a new way to put me down. I'm stuck here, as I spent my savings getting home, and the closest city is over 100km away, meaning even if I got a job and worked my ass off again, it would be a good year before I'd have enough to move out, let alone move back to the city I was living in. But I just don't have the emotional energy to do that either way. I can't sleep anymore, I lay awake with thoughts running through my mind all night, and then sleep past 10 and get scolded for it by my father. I feel like a burden on my family, like I'm a pile of failures that's done nothing but make their life harder, and I see no way I can change that.

Tonight I almost took my own life, I got in my car with a hose and a roll of duct tape, and I sat, thinking about how I could drive to a country side road, tape the hose to the exhaust and just wait until it was over. I drove around for half a hour after that, ignoring my phone and deciding on what to do. I ended up coming back home and found this subreddit while googling how to kill myself in a way that would make my body unrecoverable. 

I'm not sure I can take life anymore, but I'm not sure I can take my life either. I'm not looking for sympathy, I just wanted my story to be somewhere in case I do."

3738,Read a theory. Depersonalized a little. Now feel depressed only goes away when I am occupied. Scared of the theory,"Read about “quantum immortality”. Really freaked me out. Depersonalized really bad for a couple days. I’ve researched and the theory isn’t very logical and is very far fetched, but the fear is following me around everywhere. I just feel so shitty, and the feeling of killing my self feels... just interesting. Wanting to know if the theory is right. I hate it. Please help me"
3739,It’s hard accepting this,Do u ever just realize that your not really gonna do anything special with your life and you’re a mediocre person at best?
3740,Do you think it would change?,"Most people that are depressed describe feeling lonely and craving another human. Do you think a significant other would help you or ""cure"" your depression? Why or why not? Personally I feel like it would help, but I wouldn't wanna base my happiness on someone else."

3742,Insecure about a friend?,"I have this friend who is exceptional in every way. She's sweet, kind, intelligent, beautiful... pretty much everything you would want in a friend. I love her and am so happy for all of her successes but lately I find myself thinking about her life more than normal and comparing my life to hers. It should be noted that over the past 6 months, I have had to go through a lot of shit and as a result I have some low self-esteem. Any advice on how to stop comparing myself/similar experiences?"

3744,Depression and dissociation,"Anyone else suffering from depression and also experiencing frequent episodes of dissociation? It is charaterized as follows, and I can relate to it all except for the foggy brain. Is it common to experience this while being depressed?

you often feel ‘spacey’, ‘floaty’, or like your brain is ‘foggy’

* you might even get sleepy whenever life gets challenging
* people say you are really calm under stress, but the truth is you are just numb
* the more stressful a situation, the less you can think clearly
* you can have a sense you are watching your life instead of in it, as if life is a movie you are watching
* when people ask how you are feeling you find it difficult to know
* others often get frustrated as they think you aren’t listening
* you have delayed reactions – what you really wanted to say or do in a situation a day or several days later but very rarely in the moment
* you might sometimes even feel disconnected from your body, as if you aren’t quite in it
* you can easily overlook important details and forget moments
* you had a difficult or [traumatic childhood](https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/what-is-childhood-trauma.htm)
* you [suffered abuse as a child ](https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/child-sexual-abuse-counselling.htm)or teenager"
3745,It's terminal,"My depression has not improved in 25+ years. I look back on my calendar diary that has marks on the days I was profoundly suicidal, and see continuous markings. With no improvement to the present. 

This depression will kill me. I most likely will take my own life. I hope I can be strong enough soon.

I do not want to live another 25 years of continuously praying for death. Imagining my own suicide. Looking in the mirror and wanting to punch the image of the loser I see. I have never hated anyone as much as myself. 

All the bad things that have happened in my life are a direct result of who I am. Karma is paying me back for the mistakes I've made. Repeatedly. 

It doesn't get better. Hasn't yet. I've tried every med out there. Multiple therapists. Only thing left is ECT. And I know how that is viewed. I refuse to give another reason for people to mock and hate me. 

Depression will be with me to the end. I do not want to live anymore"
3746,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.....,"Fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My life is a joke. I haven't been on a date in over a year. I pushed away all of my friends years ago. My credit is a mess. I can't lose weight. I eat my feelings. I'm thirty-four and still live with roommates....

I have no health insurance because I can't afford it. I can't get help from a therapist for the same reason. No one likes me. I eat my feelings and then hate myself for eating. I'm gay but don't feel like I am accepted by that community because of my weight and lack of wanting to just have sex all the time.

I promise you don’t think that “this is how it is” mentality bullshit, it’s all in our heads, it’s hard I know, I’ve been getting drunk for however knows how long every night, but as of now I’m tired of this shit, I ready to fight this shitty illnes wish me luck, all Ive been doing is random shit like things that need to get done around the house, I’m a tech so I bought a broken down car to work on after work just to get through those depressed thoughts and it kinda works, try to go to bed at normal times and for the love of god keep alcohol out of this it only make you feel worse... trust me I know and low key been feeling a slight better after ditching drinking, stay strong 💪. We’re all in this hell hole together"
3756,Tired of it all,"I've been dealing with depression, at least diagnosed, for three years. Before the diagnosis I'd say many more years. I moved a while ago in hopes my life would change for the better and nothings changed. 

The same issues that plague me still follow me. The lack of eating, the anxiety, the days where I'm either restless or sleeping all day. I don't have the motivation to go out, or talk to anyone. The loneliness, auto piloting at work, the crying at night and the numbness in between. The apathy at times I hate having, the insecurities, the feeling of worthlessness, that feeling where it will never get better. 

 It only got worse when someone I thought I'd spend my life with found someone else instead. Guess these damages goods are past their expiration date. I've realized that I wasted too much time on certain things that others around me would consider pointless. Despite the warning signs I keep going for it, hoping stuff changes but I only lie to myself in until reality hits. At the end of the day I feel humiliated and stupid. And it's all my fault. 

I don't think living like this is worth it and I don't think there's any hope for me. I've been programmed by myself and others to be a certain way and I don't think I'm up for the task.
The plan i've decided is; to starve to punish myself and eventually end it once I couldn't take it anymore. I'm tired of it all. Good luck to everyone else here."
3757,Go to sleep,You will need sleep to realise that life is meaningful.
3758,I am having a very very hard time.,"I am 48 years old. I have no skill that is worth anything and I am in a position right now to lose what little I have. My 20 year old daughter is with me and the Only reason I have not just ended myself is because I can’t leave her to deal with this mess alone. She has nobody. We are both all alone. My entire family is dead. We have no friends nor acquaintances. 

I can’t sleep. I have been sick for over 12 days. I thought I maybe had ecoli from some bagged Cesar Salad I ate but I can’t get why it won’t go away. My car which is my only way to make money (lyft,Uber Eats etc) blew a bearing. So I can’t make any money right now and I need to buy the part to fix my car but I tried to walk 3 miles to see if this salvage yard had the part. I can’t do that again. It made me more sick. 

I am not making sense. What I am is in a serious horrible situation and if I don’t get this figured out before Wednesday. We are going to be kicked from our hotel room and have no where to go and literally be waking with what we can carry and our cat. 

I have been fighting to get is from under this mess for over a year maybe more and this car thing is going to take us out. We aren’t street smart. We have no idea how to live in the street. 

What worse is the guilt I feel. My daughter suffers with so many mental issues. I was trying to take care of us. But I am so petrified scared and I miss my family. We are literally all alone. There is nobody to call for help. Nobody to talk to. I am such a fucking loser. I wish I hadn’t just been a stay home mom.  Why didn’t I go to school. When my husband left he took everything with him. We had nothing. Why did I allow myself to end up in such a stupid situation. 

I love my daughter so much. So so so much. I just want to get us out of this. She needs stability. So she can get better. She is insanely smart and talented. 

I can’t have her on the streets. I don’t give a shit about me. But her. Fuck. I can’t even put into word the pain I feel from sadness. 

I really am just garbage. I am useless garbage."
3759,Culture,"Can we talk about a culture shift that has personally caused depression in my life and the life of other 20 something men that I know? I’m not sure if anyone has seen the current tik tok trend that has been happening where very attractive girls lost things about themselves that are obviously wanted by any partner and then at the end they say to hit them up or whatever. I don’t want to say that every one of them is for views and likes......... but they are definitely for attention. And this culture of being internet popular has shifted a lot more focus on women in a negative light. Women want to be respected and treated as a good partner, and don’t get me wrong I know they are out there, I just personally haven’t met them. But you have so many women posting on Instagram or tinder or TikTok for these views that it psychologically takes away who that person is from the viewer. And along with “cancel culture” and just over all trying to be respectful to women, it leaves a lot of men left feeling extremely lonely. Myself and a lot of guys I know will never hit on women while they are working because we feel bad for them. They are just trying to make money hosting at a restaurant or being a cashier. And they get hit on all the time and I’m literally just another face to them and a series of numbers. And I’m social settings I get really nervous to talk to women because I honestly just don’t want to bother them. But it’s not just me, it’s a lot of men I know that feel this way, that try and open doors for women and try and be nice guys then get screwed over in the end and it skews our outlook on a lot of the women and our interactions. Is there anyone that can relate to this? Or is this something that I’ve thought about and discussed with my friend group that we agree on BECAUSE I’ve brought it up?"
3760,people telling you to just pray,even though i am christian is it okay to get annoyed when someone just tells you to “pray about it” because im dead sure that wouldnt work. this seems like a mental illness not a depressive episode.
3761,Ever tried to write a song,"Working on trying to Express myself through song, wanted to share this one, very rough and havent made changes to the original but i figured you guys could relate to it. Have a good evening and remember none of us are alone.
Hello there, do you know me
No i mean do you really know me
You see me and you think that you do
But the truth is you don't have a clue
You see i hide the real me inside
I keep the real me in darkness and out of site
Ill make you laugh and ill pretend to feel
But the truth is nothing you see is real
The face that you see is a mask i wear well
The real me sees through it and is going through hell
Do you know me, no do really know me
Im a great guy whos heart is in tact 
But i know its broken and its all an act
Nothing you see is real
i pretend that these feelings i feel
Im stuck in a cage
I cant pretend much longer
All i know is rage
I am not sleeping nor am i awake
I feel like this life is what i must take
You never knew me. No, you never knew me."
3762,I owe it to all of the hate and pain.,"Thank you for showing me who to not be. 

Thank you for saving me from years of unhappiness and unsatisfaction. 

Thank you for telling me that I deserve something better and more likeable. 

Thank you for the job rejections I got from the US and Canada. Looking at it now, everyone is unhappy over there - Student debt, High taxes, and the like. 

Thank you for giving me the rare opportunity to show me who you really are behind that fucking mask you put on your face. 

I may not have applied to schools like MIT or Harvard, but I'm thankful I don't need to apply to them because all of their stuff is online and out there for everyone. 

I want to say thank you for making me even stronger and teaching me to value myself. At the end of the day, I am my own best friend."
3763,i thought i was doing better,the past few weeks i was the happiest i’ve ever been. i felt like my life was finally put together and everything was great. today something happened that wasn’t a big deal at all and it kinda put me in a bad mood so i just had my head down in class. then someone asked me if i was okay and i just broke down and cried. i literally had nothing to cry about but i couldn’t stop crying. then more people asked if i was okay and i cried even more. i haven’t cried in weeks and everything was just coming out at once  but i don’t even know why i was crying
3764,I‘m going to end my life before the year is over,"I have been trying to keep it together for years now, but I just can’t anymore. I told myself after surviving my last suicide attempt that I would never do it again, but I’m going back on my word. I just can’t do this anymore. I’m tired of being treated like a joke, because I suffer from a mental illness that I have no control over. I’m tired of people acting like they care only to feel better about themselves, and then turning me away when I actually need help. I’m tired of bending over backwards and begging people to stay, just to have them leave anyways. I’m tired of pretending like everything is fine just so that everybody else can be comfortable. I’m tired of these stupid flashbacks I keep having of things that I don’t want to be focusing on. I’m tired of all the crying. I’m tired of all the breathing. I’m tired of it all. All of it. I’m tired. I just can’t do this anymore."
3765,I made a sub that could be useful to some of you,"It’s called r/SymptomCombo and it’s for people to discuss what happens when a bunch of conditions coexist and what it does to you, and depression does that a lot. Pls sub if you think it would be helpful and spread the word"
3767,Can anyone help me understand?,"Hello redditverse, let me just start off by saying this is so serious to me I took time to grab my laptop instead of using my phone lol. With that being said here's my question, for almost the last thirty months I have been at rock bottom and I thought I got out of this rut about four months ago. My problem is today I sit around and i'm not ""depressed"" however I feel lost still. I am happy with the progress on my life and I can reflect on how I used to be and am happy I am no longer at that stage. 

Am I just spending to much time looking forward to my future or is this natural?  I feel like it's weird and selfish for me to compare this as anything like the depression I have been in since 2016.

Anyways any feedback would be helpful. 
Thank you."
3768,I think that I know I give up on myself a long time ago,And now trying to live has become harder because of my past mistakes. I can’t seem to forgive myself for the mistakes I made in my life. Sitting down I want to live but feel like I can’t. I destroyed my life to the point it’s going to be hard to do anything with it and wonder is any point to try anymore. I talk to my sister and I’m so happy for all the things that has happened to her but it was like mad this like the last time we might talk because with me I never know if if I’m really commit suicide or not. I feel like I have every reason too. I just don’t want too I want to live and overcome this shit but i don’t think it’s worth it anymore. There is nothing I want in life that’s worth continuing on. I wonder what’s happens after life if I’m immediately met with God or I’m going straight to hell.
3769,am i going to be this way forever?,"for background, i can’t remember ever not being depressed. i have on and off taken antidepressants since i was about 11-12ish, i’m almost 18 now. ive always needed them, it’s never been a case of me not being on them because i didn’t. recently, i’ve decided to start actually fixing my mental health and it’s taken a while, but i’m at a really good place now. the good days greatly outnumber the bad days.  but i have some questions. am i going to be depressed for the rest of my life? will i have to take antidepressants everyday forever? if not, how am i supposed to know when i don’t need them anymore? any answers or general insight would be greatly appreciated."
3770,So sick of living but scared of pain,If i wasnt  scared of pain i would of killed myself  im thinking of ways  thet wouldnt be painful. I get anxiety everywhere i go its haunting me and in my mind im in a prison i just wish i could die in my sleep i really do nothing makes me happy anymore watching  tv makes me sad its either horror or love stories nobody  will  never love an anxiety ball. Everytime i leave the house it makes it worst because i feel like I don't  belong and  people look at me strange because my depression and anxiety  wont let me blend in with the public i feel like everyone hates  me . Hell i hate  myself all i ever did my whole life is play video games and i been on anti depressants psychosis pills since  i was  about age 9 i always had issues but i can feel the walls  closing in im stuck  in my bad thoughts and id do anything  to feel normal but i have so many problems in my head . I also find  it really hard to piss when othere are around its like my subconscious never lets me be at ease and let go . I just want an easy way  out of these feelings their really scary and im scared to live in this crazy  cruel world
3771,I almost hit a truck,"An hour ago I was driving back home it was dark out and I was really tired. As I was driving, my mind went somewhere else and I accidentally drove through a red light, I almost hit a truck that was passing the other way. If they didn’t stop it would’ve been a bad hit. I’m sitting here thinking about what just happened but I’m not even shaken by it. I feel bad that I almost hit the other person but I don’t care about the fact that I almost got hit. Am I really numb to death?"
3772,What if you went for it,"I wake up. I don't want to get out of bed. I've missed too much work already.  I've been ""sick"" and sick a lot more often than usual- any excuse to stay home and go back to sleep.  I dose myself with anything I can find.  Weed, whiskey,  even benadryl or cold medicine. Just to stay asleep longer and go to bed earlier. I go through the motions at work.  Sometimes I eat,  sometimes I forget.  I've lost 40 lbs. I try to focus on healthy habits.  I don't always succeed. I go through periods of healthy behavior, followed by binging,  followed by starvation.  I cook when I'm happy or when I have to feed my kids; I go for a run when I'm angry or depressed; I listen to music about loss, death, depression, or suicide just so I can cry. I hunt for meaningless sex just to feel alive for a few moments; the fleeting euphoria from this leaves me empty and wanting more. I post naked pictures sometimes, just more self seeking validation bullshit. I crave attention from someone who cares and wants me for who I am, but I seem to be going about it all wrong. 
It all started when I got a medical condition that robbed me of my childhood and self-esteem,  or was it when I got married too young to the wrong person, or was it when my parents died, or when I lost my faith, or when I started drinking too much, or when I had my fourth ""accident""? I really should have gotten that vasectomy. Or maybe it started when I cheated on my wife after 14 years of faithfulness.  Fucking excuses.  Bullshit. Self destruction. Pain. Maybe I was just never happy.  Maybe im not capable anymore. Maybe I don't  deserve it. Just hold it all inside and keep your chin up. Don't show that weak shit to anyone. 
Separated.  Two households.  No money.  Divorce.
I have a girlfriend now. We connect very well on many levels.  I've never been happier or more down in my life. We fuck like wild animals and share our darkest desires and secrets. We communicate.  We're friends.  She's everything my ex wasn't. Bitch doesn't even respond to my texts or take a second to let me know she cares. Shut up you fucking idiot.
She has a life outside of you,  you dumb fuck. You aren't the center of the universe.  Maybe she's just busy.  Maybe shes just using you.  She says she loves you.  She doesn't love you.  Nobody loves you.  Kill yourself. Why doesn't she respond? Be cool. Don't fuck this up.  She's not in charge of your happiness,  you needy little bitch.  Be happy.  Be happy. Be happy."
3773,I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to die,(17) I have been feeling pretty different ( I was gonna say sad but that’s a terrible way to describe it) for way over a year now and I have been thinking about killing myself for 3 months now. At first it was just wondering what the whole point of life was and thought that nothing mattered. I think I have depression and I haven’t  found any enjoyment in anything for a long time now. I don’t have any friends I can talk to about this and wouldn’t want to because I’m so embarrassed about it. I feel like a lot of kids always say there depressed and want to kill themselves on the daily now. I don’t want to be treated like another one of “those kids”. I was planning on swallowing a whole bunch of pills but all I can think about is how my mom would react. I can’t do that to her. I just want a break from everything. I don’t really want to die I just want everything to stop. I sometimes have hope for the future. I have things that I want to do when I get older like travel and go to NYU. I used to be a really funny outgoing person. I was always a little shy and awkward but people liked me bc I was fun to be around. I’m scared that that I will feel and be this person forever. I’m so boring and sad all the time now. I worry about everything and I’m very quiet now. I have no energy anymore. I don’t want to live a life where I’m scared to do everything I want because the old me isn’t like that. What will change from  High school to College. When I think about killing myself I always think about taking the pills and then calling 911 right after. I think about what all of my old friends would think. I always image them realizing how much they cared for me and wanting to we be friends again. But in reality I don’t think they would give a shit. But then I think of my mom and I can’t do it. That would be so selfish. I honestly want to do it so my friends and family will talk to me. I don’t want to die. When I say my friends and family I mean I’m not close with any of my family. I love my mom and we’re getting lose but everyone else I don’t talk to them. I don’t have any friends I’m close with. I tried to tell my best friend that I was going through a rough time and she didn’t even ask why. It seemed like she didn’t care. My other best friend ghosted me. I asked her why but she said we were fine but she’s been really mean to me and ignoring me. I want to kill myself but I don’t want to die.
3774,Anyone feel like an idiot for being positive and optimistic,Sometimes I will randomly become optimistic and hopeful. I will tell myself that I will find happiness one day. I always feel like an idiot afterwards for being so naive and stupid. I will never be happy. No point in lying to myself.
3775,Y’all ever feel as though there is no ‘In between’,"Like I either don’t eat or I can’t stop eating, I either sleep like I’m dead or I an insomniac, I either clean compulsively or I don’t clean at all, the list goes on. I’m sure everyone feels this odd feeling of wanting to restart everything cause you just feel out of control. Life is crazy I just want it to end, but I don’t have the strength, or maybe I am holding on to the little ounce of hope I have left. (Just a rant)"
3776,and the manic episode is over. when i’m in it i want it to end but when i’m out it’s the most depressing shit ever,"i’m laughing at things that are barely funny and now i’m just laying here emotionless as ever. again.

people look at me and think because i make jokes all the time that i’m funny and i’m positive and they always tell me i’m amazing

and then i disappoint them. even in my manic states i feel nothing for them. it’s gone, and it’s been like that for almost two months now

it’s not even like i have anxiety anymore. i mean i obviously do, but it’s different than before. i just want to fucking feel again. at this point i don’t even know if a diagnosis would help

hopefully my new medication works because that’s really all i’m hanging onto right now."
3777,Escaping feelings,I’m starting to think if I die I can escape the feelings of social anxiety and depression I have on a daily basis. I can be in my dreams forever where life is without pain.
3778,"Addiction, Expulsion, Mental Ilness","I’m lucky to have all of them. I’ve been expelled me senior year for my drug use (they drug test us)  of highschool, with only a couple months left (although ultimately it was the principals wrong decisions nearly all administration was vouching for me) there’s a chance I could go back but I truly don’t want to. Everyone there most likely thinks I am crazy and stupid, When I really have a substance abuse problem. I recently got back from the mental hospital too. I hit an artery or vein idk which one from self harm the other day but didn’t go to the hospital I just wrapped it up. I want to die. I want to die with every bone in my body lord someone take me away I’m begging."
3779,Coming back,"I can't believe that I'm back here again. I was depressed and suicidal over 6 years ago and I thought that I really escaped that period of my life. It was so horrible going to a psych ward and having to take medication and therapy. But I think in a combination with that, and going to college, my life really transformed and I felt like I made something out of myself and had something to live for. 

But I'm back here again, and I don't know why. I feel like I deserve this punishment, and nothing and no-one is here to care about me. I don't understand what changed that's making me feel like this. I would hate to take my own life, but if I were in an accident I wouldn't try to fight for my life. I don't think my life is worth fighting for. If I can't die, I wish I could disappear forever, and not tell anyone about it. It feels like such a burden to interact with people. I don't want people to know where I am. I want to be alone forever, but at the same time, it is being alone that is hurting me. I regret being the person that was born from my mom, why couldn't it be someone else?"
3781,I will never succeed at anything in life,"All I want to do is build a life for myself but I'm too incompetent to do that. I can't make it in the real world. The only thing that I have in this life are my thoughts and other things that let me escape from it all and not think about my life more than I have to. All I can do is smoke weed. There is no use in trying anything anymore. My perception of everything is not normal like other people's is. I can recognize how I can perceive things differently, but I can't really believe them. Thinking a different thought doesn't effect me emotionally. I am still dead inside. I tried for so long to be happier but every day it gets clearer that there is no use. There isn't a reason to be happy. And on top of it all I am just too incompetent.

When you reach adulthood without good enough social skills or with psychological problems, you will fail. This cannot be any cleared to me. I don't have a reason to feel like there is a point in life, because I'm never going to find love. I'm never going to be that guy who starts a successful business. I'm never going to be that guy who has marketable skills he can comfortably live off of. I'm never going to have any friends. I haven't felt like another person was an actual, real friend that I can rely on since I was a child. I see all of these people enjoying social bonds and finding love, all these people living in wonderful homes, driving cars that aren't liable to break down, and I just see what I will never be good enough to have. I hate myself. I hate that I have to live as this person. I can't be any different. I cannot make myself feel any different. There are no actions that I can take to try to ""better"" myself. No amount of self improvement is ever going to make me see how I will ever be able to make it in life. I just want a gun. I'm sick of having to deal with even a little bit of the adversity in life. 

There is no hope. I think my suicide note is just going to be me explaining how I could so obviously never succeed in life. You can't explain this to people when you are still alive. They get angry at you, or just don't believe it. Everyone wants to think everyone else can just choose to be successful or skilled people. This isn't true. I put the work in every day but I don't feel proud or even like what I'm doing even matters. There isn't anything I can change to make that different. I've wasted too many opportunities and what you reap is what you sow. I was never born to succeed.  It is so obvious, and frankly, I think only one of my siblings has a chance to make it. My parents are failures and much of their offspring are doomed to the same fate. A tainted litter with shitty genes, the products of a personality/anxiety disorder-ridden mother and ADHD, hard-drug-user-from-13-to-18 father. I don't know what I expected from myself. No sliver of hope in sight."
3782,Side effects making me scared to take my meds,I haven’t taken my meds in 3 days because the heartburn I get is insane. I throw up my pills most of the time anyways when I do take them because of acid reflux so severe it makes me vomit. I am feeling emotional and physically achy but I cannot keep them down. Someone convince me that the pros outweigh the cons of taking my meds because I just can’t.
3783,i sabotage my own happiness,"i felt choked up. i didn't know where i could turn for this, so i came here...

every time my life seems to be in check, i just. mess it up. i know that it's my own fault, that somehow i keep pushing and ruining it for myself, but i can't control it.

things go amazing- i'm happy and maybe a little in love and having fun and then the weekend comes, any weekend, and i catch onto how tragic and delusional i am and i just. give up.

i left early from work and just cried in the taxi ride home today.

i don't know how i expect anyone to take me seriously when i treat myself like this."
3784,fucking over it,"i feel so fucking unsatisfied with my life! i hate the college i go to i have no friends and don’t fit in whatsoever, i hate my job and am going so backwards in life. like my grades are not even bad but i don’t wanna fucking go to college i don’t have a passion for anything but i also don’t wanna just fucking work 24/7 instead. like what the fuck do u do when u want change but don’t know where to start?? i genuinely just want to die so bad i think that would solve every one of my problems."
3785,I’m going to try and be productive tomorrow,"I’m going to try to be productive tomorrow and get a haircut, hit the gym for the first time in like two weeks and go to the library and get a couple books I want to read, clean my room despite how I feel inside"
3786,Warms my heart,"So I already post something here but my wife has been diagnose with severe depression. Of course she's depressed and sometimes sad and everything.. I understand that but it breaks my heart to see her that way.

Right now, at this moment, I can't sleep and she is sleeping. And I can hear her giggles, it warms my heart!!

I just want to say to people here, enjoy the little things in life. I know it's hard especially in this time of the year. But if you go to bed after another day, and you can fine one thing. Just one little tiny thing that was okay, fine, or not so bad then you are a winner."
3787,i’m making everyone in my life sad,"i’m about to graduate from college in the spring and i feel like i have nothing to be proud of. i graduated from high school with a high gpa, acceptance to every school i applied to, and a bunch of extra curricular activities done with. everyone was so proud of me and i felt like i was ready to move onto college and make something out of myself. i started college doing very well.....but i have been getting progressively worse each year. i ended freshman year with a 3.4 gpa and i’m now struggling to bring up my 2.8 to a 3.0. i’ve never made deans list. i’m not graduating with any kind of honorary like my friends and family did. i understand that depression had a huge impact on my academic performance, but i can’t forgive myself for doing so poorly. 

i entered this semester going through an episode that lasted through midterms and i spent finals working my ass off trying to make up for my mistakes....but instead i ended with a 2.5 and failing a class for the 2nd time. my mom keeps saying she’s proud of me but how can she be when i’m the family screw up? i cant imagine how inconvenient it must feel having me as a daughter. my cousins have graduated with honors, acceptances into grad programs, and making actual changes to the world around them. meanwhile, i’m in a major where grad schools required and, with my grades, i’ll probably never get in. i didn’t connect with a single professor. i got a great internship and probably messed things up with my mentors. i’m VP of a student org and can’t come up with anything valuable to contribute to it. my gpa is too low for an organization that i really wanted to join. i got accepted to this excellent school only to become depressed and waste money on a degree that i can’t even remember anything about. and now i have to face that. if people are proud of me they shouldn’t be. 

i don’t look forward to graduating at all. i feel like my life’s just gonna get worse and i kind of don’t wanna live through it. i’m just gonna continue to disappoint everyone and myself. if i wasn’t an only child, i’d kill myself but not wanting to upset my mom is the only reason i don’t. i hate my life, so much. i genuinely don’t see a good life for myself in the future. i don’t know what to do about any of it, nor do i have the motivation to actually do anything. i was supposed to be great but i feel destined to fail....sorry if this was too much but i have no one to talk to lol"
3788,I CAN’T TAKE IT FOR MUCH LONGER,"I don’t describe the feeling as sadness, I can kind of describe it as a sort of numbness I guess.
I felt sad for 2 years and now I’ve felt numb for over a year. I don’t know what to do. I’ve told the people around me how I feel and they describe it as typical teenage shit. 

I know that the people who see this are going to think that I’m just another sad teenager that will get through it and stop being such a pussy sooner or later, but believe that I won’t. Honestly, even if one day I wake up feeling so great and amazing, I don’t think I could survive long enough to see it. I hate how stupid and corny I sound, but I don’t know what else to say. 

I’m so tired of everything ughhh 
I’m so stressed I can’t relax
I’m laying in my bed listening to shitty music thinking about how I need to feed my gecko. I’m thinking about my grandpa. I’m thinking about how fucking fat and lonely I am. I’m thinking about how I’m SO FUCKING NUMB I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE"
3789,I slept all day and will be up feeling awful all night,Started off the morning great- Headed to class and broke down crying in my car and had to head home. Then spent a few hours sobbing at home before falling asleep until 10pm. Now I'm ready to be awake and alone all night long. Shit sucks
3790,Every day that goes on things just seem to get worse.,"I’m yet to experience a day that I can look back on and not associate something sad with it. Everything I do, no matter what it is, I just feel lost. Like nothing has meaning and nothing ever wants to get any better. All I want is one day where not a single depressed thought crosses my mind. A day where I can actually be happy for once."
3791,Not sure what to do anymore,"I've recently moved to a new country for work and have been in a constant state of depression the whole time. I came here with a good friend who has distanced himself to do his own thing and seems to be pushing away. I know nobody else here that knows the place as well as he does, and I don't feel comfortable going out by myslef - not from a safety perspective, but from a ""this seems like a waste of time by myself"" and judgement perspective. 

I used to love travelling,  which is why I wanted to move here. Now I have no interest in leaving my home and would rather just stay in bed and sleep or work out across the street. I used to love exploring on my own and now I just don't feel like it's worth my time. 

I have really nobody here to talk to anymore. Going to work is the best time of the week because it occupies my time and mind. I dread the weekends, especially extended ones. Holidays are miserable as everyone is with friends and family except me. 

I don't want to seem selfish. I've always put other people before me. I find enjoyment in helping people and always help my friends and family first. I've done this so long to the point where i don't even know what to do for myself. I tried traveling but ended up turning around and coming home, since I convinced myself its not worth it. I have the hardest time meeting brand new people, as the closest people in my life has been there as a result of paths crossing. I love helping people, but I'm exhausted and feel very underappreciated for what I do. That said, I dont expect gratification from my help.

Even at work, I'm treated like trash since I'm the newest guy. Part of me is considering going to work every day including weekends and days off, just so I can have something to do. 

I'm just lost and wanted to get something out there. I'm very sad because I feel like this move is destroying one of my closest friendships and I'm just generally lost and isolated here and don't know what to do.

Thanks if you read this far. Any thoughts are appreciated"
3792,I miss making people cum,"God damn it its just my favorite thing

I dont even care if I cum...

Just watching the pleasure, listening to their breath as they tighten around my fingers..

I've been sexless for over a year and I can't take it anymore... I can't touch myself I can't look at porn.. I just exist.

If it wasnt for my writing I would have killed myself from loneliness."
3793,I pushed away a guy i love,"I met a guy in my psychology class beginning of this semester, we hit it off really quickly and before I knew it he told me he loved me. I love him too but instead I pushed him away. I’ve been ignoring his texts I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just don’t want to bring him into my shit that he shouldn’t have to deal with I can barely stand myself. I would be the most overwhelming person to be with I can’t do that to him"
3794,I compensate for my own Misery by trying to make others happy.,Can anyone else relate?
3795,"I’m both depressed and happy, hard to describe but I feel like I’m being torn apart","Details: I love my parents and my friends, my parents can be really nice and love me, they got me a lot of stuff I love like video games, but sometimes my parents and friends can be real mean and bad. First: My parents, reason why they can be really bad is that they won’t let me persue my dreams, I do Taekwondo, and I’ve gotten really bored of it and want to switch to archery, chess, and study astronomy, oh but no, according to them I absolutely must do it for a much longer time, like till the end of college and I’m only in 7th grade, I get really annoyed and angry and sad when my mother comes into my room and says “TiMe To Go To TaEkWoNdO.” Also, they are kind of cowards, they blame me for some of their mistakes, also they threaten me when I’m winning an argument against them, and they also make up the stupidest things in arguments. But worst of all, apparently they don’t accept the word “depression” in our family, why? “BeCaUsE iF yOu Do SoMeThInG iN yOuR lIfE yOu WoNt Be DePrEsSeD,” absolutely unbelievable, makes me hate them so much, and to add to that, they REQUIRE grades. Friends are a bit different, some of my online friends which I’ve known for years are kinda being super mean, they ignore me, blame me for stuff, and are just mean in general. In real life, there are a couple friends who are getting really annoying. I need help, and Reddit is the only place I feel like can help me out, and if you’re wondering, yes I do kinda wanna kill myself."
3796,Just..nothing.,"  Lately I just have felt no hope for..anything. There is basically NOTHING positive going for me right now, and hasn’t been for a long time. My entire life I’ve been alone. No close friends. Never dated a girl. Never even gotten a kiss, anything like that, and I’m 17 and a half. While I am gonna see the girlfriend I’ve been dating for about 3 months on Christmas, that’ll likely just be a temporary solution.

  I can’t go to pretty much any of my family for help since they’ve barely pulled through for me up to this point. My sister has already attempted suicide, and my brother really doesn’t give a damn about anyone but himself. My mom has anxiety and depression issues of her own and my dad is having difficult living conditions and has bad anger issues.

  I have quite literally zero close friends I can talk to irl about stuff like this, and barely any “school friends” to interact with at all. It’s funny because it’s so obvious they don’t give a shit about me. They just want to copy my work, even though I’m failing half of my classes because of how I am now. They’re always joking that I’m gonna turn into a school shooter.

Trust me. If I had a gun, I’d have already shot my self.

  The ONLY thing keeping me alive right now is my lovely girlfriend. She doesn’t live insanely far, but doesn’t live close either. She has plenty of flaws, and has difficulties comforting people most of the time so I can’t really go to her when I’m like this, which by the way is 90 percent of the time I’m awake, but she is still the love of my life, not even close to the one before her. I want nothing more than to marry her and raise a family, living a happy life.

With my luck? Doubt that’ll happen though.

  My entire life I’ve been alone, same conditions as now. It’s only been in the last 4 years that I’ve been seriously depressed. A lifetime of stress, anxiety, trauma, and depression. I don’t think I have any hope of getting fixed.

Won’t surprise me if my girlfriend suddenly decides to leave me for someone better. At least then I’ll have an excuse to finally cut my worthless life short.

3798,its been so long my friends ask if im gonna do anything about it when i rant now,im tired
3799,"23 yrs old. Clinically depressed for years. Anxiety derailed my life. Feeling ashamed, embarrassed, hopeless.","Hello. I just wanted to share my story and see if anyone could relate. It’s long, so, if anything, read the last paragraph. 

I grew up with an alcoholic mom who was absent most of my childhood. I was raised by my dad and his mother once I turned 11. I missed a ton of school growing up. In retrospect, it wasn’t because I hated school but more so I was severely anxious and apprehensive. I remember being incredibly anxious EVERY day of school. Whether that’s due to insecurities, self-doubt, or even procrastination, I’m not sure. I did okay in school but each year was worse and worse as I started to care less and less. I played sports in high school and received a football scholarship.

I played my freshman year and did really well. But I was dying on the inside. I remember battling with myself every single day at practice trying to get out of my head. I have this demon that’s been with me my entire life always there to bring me down. Sometimes I would even get trapped in my head. Literally. I couldn’t even transition to another thought. It’s like I was hyperaware of my conscious state of mind or something. Took forever to grow out of that. 

I quit football and wasted all my potential because I couldn’t handle the battle each day. Stopped going to class. Transferred schools to just be a student. Did well but suddenly stopped going to class. Then, I sought professional help and began medication. Lost my 3-year relationship with the woman I had made plans to marry. But due to my depression I couldn’t be there for her because I was drowning and hated myself. Tried going to school again (should be a senior at this point), did well for the first couple months then stopped showing up to class for reasons I can’t explain. Finally, was kicked out of the university and haven’t tried school since. 

That was two years ago. I’m now 23 almost 24. I’ve spent the last few years of my life, in bed, paralyzed by my thoughts. Hours have turned into days which have turned into years. I’ve gathered myself and attempted to comeback so many times. I honestly just don’t have a reason to anymore. I don’t have a plan. I used to be somewhat social and want to be around my friends. When they asked what I was doing nowadays I could still tell them I was “taking classes online” and because of transferring I had to “...re-take some classes I’ve already taken so it’s taking a lot longer than I expected...” That lie was somewhat feasible then. Now, not so much. I’m incredibly embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I don’t want to be around anyone. Not even my family. I see people I haven’t seen since high school who are eager to see me, wondering how I’m doing, and I’m at the point where I can’t even fake happy. I’m spent. I’ve lied to them and myself for too long now. This past summer I was a groomsman at my sister’s wedding but had to leave right after the ceremony because of a panic attack thinking about greeting all of old our old friends. I first experienced suicidal thoughts about a year ago. Just kind of wondering what it’d be like, what my funeral would look like, who would miss me?would killing myself be what it took for them to see how bad it really is? is it worth burdening my family and loved ones with such a selfish act? etc. Whatever motivation I had left since then has diminished. I’ve ignored phone calls and didn’t open my mail for years. I’ve now been to court for refusal to pay student loans. I’m in a ton of debt without a degree. I’ve had my wages garnished at the part-time job I’ve worked at for over year now. The idea of suicide has always  been on the back burner. It’s been an excuse to avoid all responsibility. I’ve told myself “it doesn’t matter because I’ll just end up killing myself”. All of this snowballed into me actually sitting down one night to write a goodbye letter to my family and friends. It was the worst night of my life...After all the years of anxiety, worrying, stressing, suffering, pretending I’m fine, I AM EXHAUSTED. I’ve buried myself in a deep hole. I’ve made no improvement whatsoever in years. Always keeping suicide in play. I’ve lost all social skills. I have no confidence. I have no plan. I have no sense of urgency. I spend most of my nights trying to cry because it feels good. BUT, through it all, I somehow met a beautiful woman who loves me so much. I love her too. She’s everything to me. And it kills me I can’t be more for her. She definitely deserves more. We’ll see what happens... I’m still going to try but I’m afraid we all know how this story ends. 

Thank you for reading if you made it this far. Nonetheless, it was very therapeutic."
3800,"Hi, I just got the diagnosis...","Bipolar Depression, GAD, PTSD, Agoraphobia, Depressive Disorder. I was in the hospital after a couple weeks of unemployment. I called the hotline because I wanted to harm myself. I am now not only suicidal but homicidal. This world is full of shit. You can’t drink the water because it’s poisoned now you have to buy it. You can’t hunt and kill any animals because they’re poisoned now you have to buy it. I’m starting to think we are in a prison. We are born into debt. We are not free. I’m willing to fight for freedom. Even if I am killed in the process. 

I feel like shooting people, running them over with my car I’m not able to pay for because I can’t get a job, I feel like taking a knife and stabbing someone until my arms are worn out. I’m a monster. I am trying to tame the beast within. 

On the outside I’m an intelligient kind caring person but on the inside it’s ugly. I’m slowly losing my mind. I hear and see things not there. I think that guy over there said I stink. I think that girl just called me ugly and weird. I think that guy wants to kill me. I think she wants to rip my heart out. 

No more. Please no more."
3801,I just got diagnosed with bipolar 2,So ive been struggling for a long time and basically tried to kill myself a month ago and went to a hospital for 2 weeks. I got out with new medication and was being monitored for bipolar and finally have the diagnosis I feel so empty all the time and never learned wats to help myself out of these holes I know I'm pushing people away and school and everything for awhile and I'm afraid I'm going to end up attempting again I just don't know how to love myself. Ive never posted anything about this or told anyone in my life but I don't know what to do.
3802,being single makes me suicidal,ha ha ha ha ha I am so lonely and ugly and nobody wants to be around me and it makes me want to fucking DIE
3803,my mom doesnt understand,"today, the counselor at my school told my parents I have depression. My dad took it understandingly and tried to look in the nooks and corners of my shattering personality, while my mom; didn’t take it lightly and screamed at her. People showed me support here on Reddit, more than my own family has given me. 

My mom yelled at me inside the car, she told me all her parenting, sacrifices, patience and understanding has been thrown away when she found out I have depression. She told me I was so selfish and ungrateful, that I was looking for something else that led me to this. But it isn’t, I don’t know what’s the cause, but I know no one is to blame for the situation. She told my counselor I wasn’t that type of person, and she refused to believe so.

I felt really low, I felt like only me and my counselor are here on my journey. My mom was given a number and location of a psychiatrist, but she refused it and even yelled at my teachers who were trying to help me. I just want to be happy.

My mom blamed my friends, my friends from other schools, my computer and the school. I knew she was going to say that, but it was so stupid. She was being selfish, I could tell. My mom didn’t want to understand. I feel so alone, I was thinking of finalizing my suicide plan.."
3804,Medicine seems to be working,"I can now paint again, I can finally feel motivated to do something, I hope everything goes well for all of you too."
3805,Everyone says it's my fault for being depressed and suicidal,
3806,Solid chance I'll hang myself when I get home tonight. I always say this but it really feels like tonight could be it.,"The noose is already tied up and ready. My garage has an attic with a big opening, no door, to the bottom. I tied the rope to the ceiling of the garage. My plan is to sit in the attic, then slip down so I fall as straight down as possible with the noose around my neck. I measure it out so there will be the right amount of slack to kill me by drop hanging



All it takes is to climb up the ladder, put my head in and step and then my problems are gone forever and I'll never suffer again.


So I guess if I don't post after tonight that's why"
3807,i’m surrounded by people and i want to disappear,I wish I was gone. I don’t wanna be in this room with people.
3808,I am incredibly lonely,"I feel really stupid posting this. I don't really know how to interact with people whether it is online or in person but I feel like I need to express myself somewhere. I've always felt lonely especially since graduating high school but lately it has been hitting me hard. I don't trust my Mother or Sister enough to talk to them about this sort of thing, I feel like talking to my Father would just worry him even more considering depression runs on his side of the family (his dad lost his battle against depression), and I don't really get along with my step-parents either. My oldest friend from kindergarten and I have stopped talking and the two people who helped me when I planned to take my own life have no interest in speaking to me.

Really the only ""friend"" I have is a coworker who has her own issues and I feel like I have been stressing her out by making her the sole person I can talk to. I am terrible at meeting new people, my anxiety and paranoia tend to keep me from going out and when I do I can't seem to make normal conversation. I always talk about weird stuff and say stupid things that scare people away. I've even tried playing online games like ESO and Sea of Thieves but I have no idea how to interact with people online.

I think the only things keeping me from committing suicide or disappearing are my cats. They are the only reason I don't just sit in bed all day. I have to take care of them and make sure they live their best little fuzzy lives. But once they are gone I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't feel like I have anyone and it sucks.

I'm sorry this was so long but if you read all of it thanks."
3809,This time last year I was full of Christmas cheer. This year I'm about as festive and happy as a sack of coal.,"I've been depressed for a long time now, but last year I somehow caught a festivity bug and was full of so much Christmas cheer it was obnoxious. 

Now it doesn't feel like the holidays at all. The world feels bleak and bland, hardly anything makes me excited or motivated anymore, and I essentially just exist in a lackluster state. At this rate I'm considering depression medication, which I've been afraid of for so long after hearing horror stories. But anything has gotta be better than this..."
3810,Just looking for someone to talk to.,"If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. I need someone to talk to."
3811,Help a girl out,"I’m severely depressed and I thought perhaps people who are in a state like mine could have some advice for me.

I’ve recently had some friend drama go down that involved drugs, alcohol, illegal driving, etc...
Obviously I wasn’t too pleased with my friend’s choices, but I can’t control them.

We were standing in a line for food and I was deep in thought about whether I wanted to stay friends with these people or not. When I’m deep in thought or upset I tend to look either very serious or very depressed. My friend, let’s call him Dan, turned to me and said I should lighten up a bit.

I looked at him like what are you talking about, he only smiled and said, “hey it’s a nice day!” 
I brushed him off thinking it’s no big deal and went back to thinking.

After about a minute he grabbed my wrist to see if I had any fresh cuts, I haven’t cut for about two months, and he wouldn’t let go.

I asked him “what the hell?” He replied with “just making sure you’re okay.”

I’m used to my friends doing wrist checks at this point but I’m still a bit bothered by being grabbed by my wrist. 

I was pretty sure that this was something to do with the fact I yelled at everyone for making stupid decisions and that he was just sour over it.

Once again ignoring him, I went back to thinking if I still wanted to be friends with my old group from 6th grade. 

Dan once again turned to me and said, “you know Eliza you should really change your mood because I’m starting to question how much fun you’re going to be at my party.”

I was taken aback by this. It sounded so much like a 2nd grade threat but he was so serious. At this point I was too frustrated to deal with them and left. 

These people have been making me question my friendships again and again. I started cutting just thinking about how I’ve let them down and I burden them.

I go to the party tomorrow evening and I plan on just fake smiling my way through. It would pain me to leave but I don’t know how much more I can handle. 

They put me down a lot and talk about how they’re depression is so much worse than mine. I put on a show by walking around handing out candy canes with a smile to people for the holidays and they think everything is fine. 

They are the only friends I have and I live in a small town so trying to make new friends will be hard. 

Anybody got any advice?"
3812,My personality,"I don't know why but I don't feel like anyone wants me to exist. Everyone around me says I'm a asshole and doesn't want interact with me. Being a introvert that doesn't like being alone, well it kinda hurts. Even my parents openly say that I'm a selfish loser, you know you fucked up when your own mom calls you out. I honestly have big dreams, I want to be a aerospace engineer and help humanity reach for the stars but right now no one is supporting me and I kinda feel like I don't want to exist. In every conversation, they either talk generally or over text just leave me on read. This isn't helping my already low self confidence and I am hoping for everything to just end."
3813,I don’t know how to get better,"I want to get better. but i don’t know how. I can’t run or exercise because of my injuries. I am a writer, but writing forces me to be with my mind too much and I feel like I don’t know how to breathe anymore. 

Someone, help me before I lose myself. I’ve been holding on for four months now, but I’m really tired. I really don’t know how to do this anymore."
3815,I feel like I'll never get better,"I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I first began losing significant interest in things at \~10 years old (now 21). I have been medicated for about four years now, and have been to multiple therapists. Nothing seems to help, and I really do want to get better, I'm just not sure how. I feel like it's a part of my personality."
3816,I don’t know if I’m truly depressed,"I’ve just been feeling utter emptiness and sadness for the past few months and sometimes it’s hard to function
Most days after school I just do my homework and lie in bed. 
I noticed it’s affecting my relationship too, since I’m finding it hard to keep conversations (LDR btw so communication is key) 
I just don’t know what to do so decided to vent on this."
3817,Medication Question,"Obviously I know I need to go to a doctor to figure this out, but I want to do some research first.

Do any of you take an SSRI and something else to increase the effectiveness of the SSRI? Maybe Lexapro and Pristiq? Celexa and Ability? Something else? 

Any info and experiences shared is appreciated."
3818,Feel like I don’t belong anywhere,"It’s exhausting being depressed and sad all the time. Hanging out with friends yet I feel totally alone. Never feel like I belong anywhere. Sitting in my car, in the rain in tears and just can’t make it stop. 
There’s a poem that I remember from a long time ago.... well part of it anyway 

I want to live yet I’d welcome death
no more running til I’m out of breath
 slow down says a voice from somewhere inside
What good would it do if you suddenly died

........ (there a part here I can’t remember )

Remember this too if Death was the answer why was life giving you"
3819,tired,im tired. im tired. im tired. im tired. im tired. im tired. im tired. im tired. im tired. im tired. im tired. im so fucking tired. i can’t anymore.
3820,Should I tell my partner that I've been feeling suicidal?,Everyday I pray that I get hit by a truck or get a heart attack so that I don't have to actually kill myself. I don't want to disappoint him and make him worry about me.
3821,It sucks when even when you try to put yourself out there and be social it’s impossible,"Went out with a bunch of work friends for a Christmas party. Tried to be social and have fun but I kept drinking and people were complaining I was too loud. So I kept quiet and then people complained I wasn’t saying anything

I try to be nice and have someone just vibe with me but I can barely hold a genuine conversation. It’s hard when everyone at your table is having the time of their life while you’re struggling to hold back tears. I went home, everyone is still at the bar"
3822,New to depression,"I’ve never in my life ever struggled with depression...  until this year. Crazy how 365 days is enough to make you even consider taking your life, right? But it has. I contemplate taking multiple pills or consciously putting me in dangerous situations to take the pain away. I know... dumb, but cause I have family, friends and a boyfriend that loves me ( sometimes I question that tho)  I’ve tried to keep fighting. What advice can any of you guys give me to keep fighting? Any advice is greatly appreciated 💕"
3823,first good day in a long time,"the only time I find myself being able to be happy is when I’m with my boyfriend but today I was actually.. happy. it’s definitely a weird feeling, I haven’t been happy like this in months. I don’t even know really what made my day good but I just didn’t feel shitty. i hope it’s only up from here."
3824,"Music kinda doesn't move me as much? (SSRI's, Prozac 10mg, going to 20 soon)","I started taking Prozac 5 days ago (Diagnosed with ADHD, generalized anxiety with OCD like symptoms and I believe he said mild, I could be wrong he may have not said mild, depression) and my psychiatrist said it would most likely take me a couple weeks or so before I would feel the effects (I'm also taking 15mg Adderall and I have been since August, but I got a prescription for 20mg now so I'll begin taking that when my current runs out). The last day or two I've been feeling kinda... chilled out? Idk. I'm still feeling emotions. Yesterday I cried for a bit while listening to some music and was sad but even then it wasn't really that overwhelming like how my sadness often feels. Like it felt OK even though I was sad. I'm feeling more stable as well like my emotions aren't wilding out 24/7 changing constantly. They change but it feels like they change at a slower, healthier speed. My anixety at school has been super high (it is just like that a lot of the time though), it's kinda distracting and I'm constantly on edge/fidgeting. It could be because I've been taking poppers (smoking tobacco through a bong with weed, super unhealthy, don't do it)  a lot recently though, I usually try to buy a cigarette from someone on my way home from school so I'm kinda fiending during the day when I haven't had it. I've been trying to quit but it's hard. Also I haven't felt Euphorically high in the last few days. Like I used to get super super happy and hyper out of no where. Like high as fuck off of life. Other times I would feel dead as fuck inside and really miserable inside my head. But now it's kinda like the lows are higher and the highs are lower. Or like maybe they're happening but I don't feel them as much. Onto music. I make music. I've been getting into recording over the last couple months and I've been producing for over 2 years. My emotions have always been a tool for me with music. They've allowed me to realllly feel that it and get super infatuated with it. I have been having fun singing and improving my vocal quality recently as well which is dope. Making music, going to shows, dancing to music, singing to myself and listening to music makes me feel alive. Now I haven't had any problems making music really, though I've only really been freestyling and experimenting with vocals and vocal mixing improvements this week. I haven't done much actual recording since I started taking Prozac. But when listening to music over the last 2 days, it's still good, but like, I'm not like feeling it deep inside my soul. It's still dope. Still get's me hype and i enjoy it and it's cool and all but... I don't think it feels the same. I haven't been keeping a journal, I guess I should start today, but I feel like I feel the music less. Idk it's just less all consuming. Just like everything else. Which is maybe gonna be an issue cauz I kinda wanna pursue music lol. I'm gonna keep taking them but I'm gonna keep an eye on how my feelings progress. I'm also worried it could maybe just be placebo. Who knows though. Overall I feel good though. Whether it's the meds, just me improving mentally, or both, I can say I'm feeling kinda like ok. Slightly numb but like not in a bad way I don't think. Like nothings a big deal and everything's ok, even though my anxiety is still there sometimes.

TLDR; Started taking Prozac 5 days ago, Lows feel higher and high feels lower, kinda chilled out, anxiety probably higher than normal cauz nicotine addiction at school, listening to music is still enjoyable but doesn't feel as all consuming and like I'm swimming in it anymore, could be placebo idk"
3825,Lack of discipline is destroying me,"I can't blame anyone for my actions except for myself. Whenever I have something good going for me, I lose control and destroy it. I end up feeling worthless and like no one is ever going to want me unless I can stay useful to them.

I'm just venting. I know I'm going to make mistakes and I really need to learn this time. I can't let the monster in me control me forever. I'll be fine. I know my weaknesses now. Ilovemeilovemeiloveme."
3826,Upset and in tears,In pain and nobody to talk to
3827,What’s the point of life?,Like I don’t get it honestly... the only thing that I LOVE doing is playing games and watching anime BUT anime I’ve watched sooo much that it takes me usually months to get a good series to watch. Also I’m just not really motivated to watch anime for the last few years I can’t explain it before I could watch it every single day all day now I can’t. Gaming is another thing... I got like two new games and they are now boring. I’m getting a few more and I hope they can last me until next year and hoepfully I can get the next Xbox oooh also weathering with you is coming out next month which imma watch. Anyways besides that I don’t really get it? Even if I do find love like what will we do? The love will be very passionate for about a year... then we will start living together going to work complaining about work and living the same exact day every day until we die. This world is scary. We are always hiding... from bugs animals everything all out to eat us and kill us... I don’t want to go outside of those walls. But inside the walls it’s so damn depressing. Just got off of school and GOOOD it’s so fucking boring. Everyday is wake up at 1:00pm play games for an hour get bored as hell my phone runs out of battery watch YouTube eat somehow it becomes 9pm then sleep. Yes I just don’t get it. Stiff used to be SOOOOO fun and now everything is boring... if I can find where I want to go unlock my dreams my dreams of living in happiness with people and the one I love... what then? Should I just die? The more and more I think about it the more depressing it gets. No wonder we forget
3828,I'm so tired,I'm so tired of fighting everyday to do anything I'm tired of having to put on an act for the parent that abused me so they don't feel bad I'm tired of having to pretend I'm not as bad as people thing it's been so long since I've been truly happy I don't know what it feels like anymore I can't talk to people easily because I'm worried I will say the wrong thing I'm constantly thinking I'm stupid even this I feel like an attention whore and I don't mean it like That this doesn't need a reply I just didn't know where else to put this I can't present my true feelings easily but people here might understand which makes it easier I just don't want to have to fight anymore with myself and how I feel I want to be like other people and be happy but I know I never will it's been to long now I just feel like death is the only way out but I know I can't kill myself no matter how much I want to and how close I've come I can never do it I just want a good reason to die so I don't hurt other people thank you for reading though this if you have I just had to get my thoughts at and this is a great community
3829,I don’t even know how to feel anymore [21f],"My story is kind of long but I’ll try to shorten it up. So January 2019, I was under the influence of a certain drug and jumped off the first floor of a parking deck. I have no memory of what I was thinking but I think it’s safe to assume it was a suicide attempt. I woke up in the hospital and was there for about 3 weeks. I had to get neurosurgery and some other stuff. This surgery included inserting titanium into my head and after the healing I noticed it left a quite noticeable bump on my head that I can’t get plastic surgery for until next month I think. This really impacted my self confidence as it’s a bump on head and my nose was now different too (but not so noticeable). Not only this but since that accident, I guess I isolated myself and lost every single person I was friends with. I’m still a student in college and took the semester right after the accident off and I LITERALLY didn’t leave my house at all unless it was for follow up doctor appointments. I really don’t know how to make friends again, and it took me a while but I started being active on dating sites again. Towards the end of august, I met a guy online and we really hit it off. We started seeing each other casually and never attached a label onto what we had, but we would do stuff like go to the mall often, ice cream dates, I’d sleep over twice a week, and idk, couple stuff. But we never really had labels so I guess it didn’t mean anything? He knew my situation but he’s completely different and I don’t think he understands how mental health works but I never held that against him. I never really talked to him about my problems or feelings and kept that to myself. Fast forward to the present where I’m in school again and finals are about to start. I slept over at his place like I do almost all Thursday’s and then we went to get breakfast the next morning. On the way back he brought up the conversation of if I wanted to have something more and I told him I did cause I’m a sad and lonely person and like to have attention. Now I know my main focus should be working on myself and should not get involved with anyone until I figure my life out but I got so carried away in what we had.  I’m always positive around him and I don’t think my mental health has in anyway come in-between us. However, after texting for a bit and talking more about what we were, he told me that he just wants to enjoy his college life and that the bump on my head is hard to look at. This hit me really hard cause I thought we were going somewhere and would be able to dtr eventually but he didn’t seem interested and he basically told me he wasn’t attracted to me. I’m just heart broken and I have no one to talk to so I turned to Reddit. I hope someone had the patience to read through this and can reach out cause I could really use someone to talk to"
3830,I want to make it easy to disappear,"I want to make it as easy as possible for others to get over my death. I want children but I don't want to live long enough to see them grow, so I won't have children. I want to fade from the lives of my family members starting when I move out. Then I will maximize the risk of dying young by partaking in risky jobs like constructing skyscrapers and falling off. Or throwing myself to the front line of the military. I don't want to kill myself. But I want to die, I want to get myself killed."
3831,Confused and blank,"Distant and not knowing how to come back. Work is a great distraction but then i see amanda (my wife) and am instantly brought back to reality. I dont know why this reality is so depressing to me or what it is exactly that i find depressing. I spend all day laughing and maybe thats just it, im distracted so well that i dont feel depressed but when i get home all the fun is done and i feel what i would of felt if i never left home to begin with. I hate not knowing how to say how i feel because i really dont know how i feel. A little sad, a little numb, a little mad, and a little helpless and of course the self loathing. All these feelings of doubt and despair put into one nice tightly wrapped package for me just in time for the holidays. I cant describe how i feel, not really. Its to many feelings that play off eachother and leaves me unable to think about anything, its like my mind shuts off the world so that i can't think about how i feel. I dont really understand it, i definitely do not like it, i wish i knew why i feel like this, maybe its just depression maybe its its something worse, fuck if i know. "
3832,I can’t cry anymore,"A few weeks ago when I was feeling sad I realized I haven’t cried in years. I’ve gotten pretty fucking upset a few times since then but tears just wont come. I remember when I could cry; tears were so soothing and they helped
me get over whatever the issue was. I don’t know what to do. I want to cry, but I can’t and it sucks ASS.

Is there anyway I can force myself to cry without self harming because 1. I’m against all self harm 2. I just wanna let it all out so bad"
3833,I looked in the mirror,"I don't do it very often, I hate my reflection, there are too many things I can't change but anyway:
I look so much worse than I thought. I've been terrible recently, I didn't know it showed this much, it hasn't been this evident before I think. My bags are so black and bug and my pupils are soulless. I'm trying to stop this shit but even if I sleep and eat and exercise and diet and leave my house I still look like this. Feel like it too, though the feeling is too difficult to explain. I don't know what to do anymore apart from wait. Time moves so slowly though don't you think? Or maybe I'm just expecting too much? I don't know anymore"
3834,Everytime i leave the house go shopping or anything my heart beats really fast as if im having a heart attack i have really bad anxiety about going out anywhere its like im crawling in my skin im so lost cant find my purpose,
3835,I need some advice,"I feel depressed even though I shouldn’t. I’m handsome in good shape and tall, but because I’m so soft spoken I can’t hold a relationship. Sine I’m coming closer to graduation I have the urge to enlist to go die for a purpose. Could I have some help?"
3836,Nothing to enjoy in life anymore,"I've been depressed for a long time. But at least i had electronic music making and videogames. The two things I've always relied on for giving me interesting and enjoyable things to do are being taken from me.

Thanks depression. Now it's REALLY getting real. What do i have left now? Stare at wall? Oh you're telling me to sort out the deeper issues here before I can get back to the things I like doing?

Oh well that's fucked. I don't even KNOW why I'm so depressed. Even if i did, i don't have the physiological willpower or positivity to DO anything about it. Stop making me so miserable and taking everything from me! What did I fucking do?

I'm so tempted to not even post this but i may as well. I don't even know what the question is. I don't even know what I'm looking for. I feel trapped. I feel like it's all coming too real."
3837,Im just tired,"This is my first time posting so here we go. ( im doing this on my phone srry)

I honestly just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I feel sick, as if my body doesn't want me to eat anymore. I've constantly thought about suicide but im too afraid to do it. Ive never told anyone because no one takes me seriously. Not even my therapist. There are days where i feel just fine but as soon as someone provokes me, it all goes to shit. I just wanna stop existing. I went from an A+ student to an F. I don't see the point in trying. I dont think i have anything because of my shitty personality. I cant have a good night sleep without feeling guilty. My mom says she understands but at the same time, she doesn't. She had depression when i was young so i often spent my time watching tv. When she has Anxiety or something, she takes it out on me. I understand that shes not feeling got i a did something that she doesn't like but i have my limits too. The same thing goes to my father(except the depression part) but I feel like he's very distant. I honestly don't know him that much even though we live in the same house. 

My older sisters said that it was worse for them before they got married, but the difference between me snd them is that i grew up alone and that im used to hold in things, it hard to tell them how i feel without them making a joke about  it. I feel like they hate me because i have it ""better"" than them. Every one from my family tells me im over exaggerated and at this point i think i am. I cant have an argument without a mental breakdown down. I want to call a suicide hotline but im too scared for some reason. I think im going to continue living like this until the day i lose my fear. I tried loving myself but the sadness over powers it."
3838,Realization,"I’ve never been okay, never been able to feel right, never been happy or at least truly happy, but now I’m realizing just how bad it’s been, just how fucked up my past was, and how fucked up my present is too. All the issues I have now, they’re too much to fix. There’s never gonna be a person to love me and accept me for who I am, because truth is I’m defective and nobody wants a defective person."
3839,Broken,"My ex broke up with me a month ago and already moved on to someone else after a few weeks and today she blocked me for trying to talk to her about my feelings and told me I'm just guilt tripping her which is not my intent. I felt such pain that a person would be this cruel and leave me here to suffer.

My past relationships always invovled my exs moving on to someone else relatively easily or in a few weeks after breaking up with me. So this is nothing new but this time it just feels a whole different kind of pain especially how depressed I am already.

I just feel like empty everyday, most of my friends are focused on their own lives and dont have much time to hang out. I feel like they're tired of me venting all the time as well.

Im just not happy overall, with my life, and myself. I feel like theres something wrong with me that everyone seems to leave me behide.

I just can't take it anymore."
3840,I love being depression,Is that normal? Idk y but I almost carve it even tho i hate it so much
3841,Everything is hitting all at once and I cant handle it much longer...,"I have struggled with depression since I was younger.. I am now 24.. Lately my depression has been over taking alot and out of no where I'm starting to get anger problems.. Like anger where my body starts to tighten and tingle.. And everything seems like I am super high! Never have I felt something like this till recently. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel I am hanging on by a damn thread and soon I feel I'm just going to stop trying!!! I dont fucking talk to any one or even try to cuz to me I think their problems are more important! Not that it matters cuz when I tried to fucking text what I was going through I just got an ""ok"".... I hate life anymore I hate myself I hate everything!!! Honestly dont want to even live anymore!! I'm to scared to take my own life! To scared to swerve into the other lane driving to work! I dont know what to do anymore!!!! I'm fucking tired!! I put everybody above my self and I just need I dont even know what I need anymore.. Alot of triggers at ""home"" but what can I do?! Leaving isnt really an option! I have 4 amazing fucking kids who ilove to death even when their devil's! But I dont know anymore my depression and anger feels like it will take over completely soon and I'm scared.. Just need to vent.. I'm tired and dont know what to do anymore..."
3842,"It's 3am, I can't sleep and I need a hug","I'm sad. I need a hug. Trying to sleep but thinking about all the good times I had with people who are no longer my friends. Normally thar would make people happy, thinking of the good times but makes me sad.

Heart is breaking. So alone. Missing my ex. Don't want to be here anymore"
3843,Depression makes me weird.,"Whenever I feel badly depressed, I keep wanting to make sexual advances on my mother in law. She lives with us some of the time. I’m always more frisky when I’m depressed... my wife isn’t super into sex most days. I’ve look elsewhere unfortunately. Other women. Never panned out as far as sex goes. I’m guessing I get frisky because it makes me feel better, at least for a bit. Anyone else do shit like this? How can I manage this urge to ruin my life? And their lives."
3844,I just hurt myself for the first time.,I never thought it would get to this point to be honest. I’m glad that I don’t want to kill myself that much yet. I’m terrified of cuts so I took a little screw and heated it up and kinda branded myself with the flat end. It’s just a little dot on my forearm so I doubt people will notice if they even see that part of my arm. I kinda just did it to see what it felt like. I liked it. It made me feel energetic for the first time in a while and I finally felt better. I’m on medication but it isn’t working and I need to feel better now. I wanted to tell someone about it but I obviously couldn’t irl so I decided to tell you guys.
3845,"""you have such an unique way of being"". Oh thanks it's the trauma",
3846,Advice?,"The other day my sisters texted me asking if I was going to school. I was but I was gonna go to school late. After I didn’t reply they came to the conclusion that I wasn’t going. One of my sisters said how disappointed she was in me. Then my other sister said, 

“Yeah I get it being a teenager is soooo rough cause you get everything you could ever want. But you need to grow a pair and go to class. That's your only responsibility and you can't even try to do that?”

And you know what? That fucking hurt. This week I had managed to go to school every fucking day despite my entire body working against me. They ruined my entire day and I cried in the arms of my friends. I replied and they didn’t bother responding.

My response: Yeah my life is sooo rough and I get everything I want that's why I shouldn't feel the way I do, you think that doesn't make me feel worse? You think I don't know how many people have it worse than me? I know you're just trying to motivate me but frankly it's making me feel like shit. 

I told my parents and they told me they were just looking after me.

Am I overreacting???"
3847,By the time I'm 32...,By the time I'm 32 I should have paid off student loans... if by this time I still am unhappy with my life then well at least my mom won't have to worry about my student debt ...
3848,I feel like I'm going completely insane,"I don't even know what's going on anymore. Life is just one big horrifying and awful blue. I don't k ow why I keep going every decision I make is for the worse, and I just keep Disappointing everyone I meet. the only person I even had a chance with in terms of being good friends/ maybe even in a relationship with now hates me and (idk for sure yet) might have even moved schools, maybe to get away from me? Idk, maybe I'm overreacting, but it feels like it when it seems like you were the only thing wrong in her life. I just want to yell and cry and punch wall just FUCK"
3849,Is anyone else a chronic workaholic?,"(Sorry for the long text in advance!) 
This past month, I was forced to make a month off due to work circumstances. I typically put in over 50+ hours at my day job, and then have a side job I put in about 4-5 hours per week too. I’ve doing doing fairly well as far as my depression goes. Was able to keep up a good work ethic, socialize a little, and even had a few small hobbies going. 

But after being forced to take a month off, I fell apart within the first 3 days. The black wave of nihilism, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts hit me like it had never left. I tired to keep up my healthy routine (workout, do CrossFit, go to Jiujitsu, spend time with friends) but it all felt so hopeless and meaningless. All my good habits and routines I had carefully built up had failed. 

Is this normal? I had no idea I pushed myself so hard to keep my depression at bay, Why does it all come crashing down when I stop working? This past month off should have been a welcome and needed reprieve with family and friends. Instead, it was an anxiety and hopeless month in bed. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Any insight is appreciated!"
3850,I’m more suicidal than ever,I can’t see an end I can’t i fuckin can’t i’m so tired and hurt and disappointed i hate my weakness i hate shit that i have no control over i wish i was dead i wish i had no family so i could end it without hurting anyone i wish i was strong enough to do it I can’t wait any longer I can’t take it anymore physically mentally drained i’m lonely i’m just no good there’s no point anymore maybe i’m just not cut out for this I don’t want happiness i just wish for this to end soon very fuckin soon I just want to rest I can’t rest
3851,Short story,"

Long story short : I've had serious depression since I was 13 ish (professionally diagnosed dw lol) , my mother is an alcoholic who's been hospitalised multiple times because of her drinking. School was incredibly hard and some lies spread by an ex made it impossible, bearly made it through school, now waiting to go uni, I have no one who shares my interests or anyone I can rly call a friend, just feel incredibly lonly, sad angry and empty all the time now. I had used to struggle with suicidal thoughts but Id never do something like that. But I'm.now just stuck and alone  Finally because of all the shit that's happened (there's alot more I gave the short version) I really struggle to show emotions meaning I physically can't cry for more than a few seconds before my body just shuts it off and I'm just trapped feeling physically sick because of all the emotions trapped I go to therapy but yeah.... If u read this far thank you for listening means alot for anyone to take me seriously.
If you would to know more or have any questions please do say"
3852,"I tried to send this message ""the part in quotations"" to my best friend of 8 years but was to much of a coward to do it.","""I gotta ask you a favor man and I'm just gonna be blunt cause there really is no sugar coating this. Trust me i tried to think of a way too. Since you got a job you got a debit card so would you use it to order me a small amount of fentanyl with syringes from the darknet. I think you know what im asking for here and im sorry to put this weight on you and i know it's such a shitty thing to ask and i hate myself for asking. But idk what else to do. I just want to go peacefully. That's all i want. I won't hold it against you if you aren't comfortable or simply refuse even."" 

I spent like 20 minutes trying to hit send but I'm just to much of a fucking coward. 14 years of this shit. I remember being 7 years old and i felt so sad and alone and hated by everyone that i thought if i died I'd make my family happy cause i wouldn't be around. I crawled into the little space under neath my bed stand, I'd sit down there to play in private, and i had a kitchen knife with me. I tried to slice my throat open at 7 but was to much of a coward then too. Now i want to do it cause i truly believe its my only escape.

I use to think i was stuck in this cell and that there was poison in my veins. I was a sick caged animal. But i realized something. There is no cage or poison. I'm the cage. I'm the poison. I can never be free unless i escape me. But I'm still that scared little 7 year old boy cause I'm still to much of a coward.

I just wish i could say ""i haven't tried it all"" so i could fool myself into having some hope but nothing has ever worked. Multiple Therapist psych meds psych ward stays alternative therapies lsd ketamine dmt walks writing music. I could go on. I've tried everything humanity has to throw at mental illness. I'm just hopeless. Just a worthless garbage person pathetically waiting to die and rot. To cowardly to die and to broken to live."
3853,I'm so tired from all of this,"I could not get the job I dreamed about because I'm always nervous in the interview and this work in other country and my english speaking skills just not good enough. But I'm so tired from living in Russia, it's just so fucking shithole. With fucked up laws, fucked up government and fucked up everything.

Also I love girl from work, but she is married and just too good for me. And I think she may be involved in some shady shit at work.

I'm just so tired from all of this. I just want to end it all. I'm such a loser"
3854,Why does depression gotta mess with my head and body,"I figured out how to get the big seratonin and life’s good but now I’m getting bad grades and I’m physically exhausted 

Can my brain not just let me exist???


I used to smart and happy and social why must I always either want die or have extreme exhaustion just for using my brain smh

Too tired to look for a therapist imma just stare at the wall now night y’all"

Eventually we all die"
3857,I don’t get why I self harm,"I haven’t self harmed in a very long time, but once in a while I just think to myself “you know what, we gonna cut ourselves today cheef” and I just go do it, and that’s what has caused it every time before.

And there’s never any crying or hateful feelings during it, my mind is just blank. I just don’t understand why I do it if it doesn’t do me any satisfaction? I don’t enjoy pain and I flip out over the thought of someone catching me cause they’ll think I’m crazy. It’s just pointless but it ends up happening time after time all the same."

3859,"Approaching 30, nothing changed, never will. Now maybe it's time to end this pain in my way.","Wish, I could have just died. I'm still lonely as always, still nobody gives a fuck, still there's not even a hint of things working out. I can't drag this anymore. It's too heavy."
3860,I'm never going to find love,"I just left from my local botanical garden's ""Garden of Lights"" Christmas display and was let down twice. I was supposed to go on a date with a guy who agreed to go to this with me. First time we were supposed to go in a group last week, he couldn't show up because of our stupid boss. Fine, we will do it next week. Tonight was the second attempt and had the tickets I purchased last week for us to go and I made my way there. I called him twice, never picked up, texted him once, never responded. I redeemed the tickets having confidence he would come for him and I to enjoy a beautiful evening and now I'm just crushed. I spent the whole time (almost two hours just sitting in the lobby) waiting with no response, noting. Why am I so unfortunate?

Why is it that I can get hookups from guys on Grindr but I'm so cursed when I just want a boyfriend. I'm definitely not an incel but I just want more than a dick to suck and a guy to fuck. Even though I'm successful getting my foot in the door in politics and being an LGBT affirming pastor, I feel like nothing more but a waste of oxygen because I can never be lucky as my siblings to find love. Why throughout my whole life have I always been so fucking weird and unlucky with almost everything? Can anyone accept me for who I am and not treat me like a sex object?"

I can’t talk to anyone without making a fool of myself, not can I maintain more than one relationship at a time it seems.

Every night I ponder killing myself until I become too tired to get up. Why can’t I just find someone who cares that I can actually feel comfortable talking to!"
3864,"Living life as a lonely, ugly woman...","Honestly, I'm tired of hurting.

I'm literally at work right now locked in the office alone. I'm crying as I write this.

I genuinely don't know what's wrong with me. There's something about me that repels men away. Just the thought of a man being interested in me feels like a fantasy. I'm turning 21 soon, and I've never been on a date, had my first kiss, or had an actual relationship. My entire love life is just me fantasizing what it's like to actually have a man care about me. I always get excited when I have these thoughts, and then reality hits - this is something I'm most likely never going to experience. 

I hate it when people tell me to try harder. I do try and it always results in me getting rejected and humiliated. I literally have a list of every single guy who has rejected me. My standards are to the floor. My own sister cried when she saw the guys I've been asking out because she felt bad that I even considered asking them out.

I've been seeing a psychiatrist for over a year. I have been doing well mentally, that's why I attempted to date. However, each rejection broke me. Slowly, I started to remember that I truly am ugly. The medications only gave me a false idea of myself. I'm actually fucking ugly, and only I was unable to see it.

It's so embarrassing now. My mother is already discussing me having a wedding and kids. My parents think that I've dated around and I'm just waiting for the right person to come along, but that's not the reality. I'm too embarrassed to tell them that no man has ever been interested in me. At this point, my mother is telling me to lower my standards even more so that I could find someone.

I literally lie to them about going on dates. A ""date"" is just me going to a restaurant alone do have a few drinks.

When I was in eight grade, one of my classmates told me that I'm never going to have a boyfriend. I was mad when they said this, but now that I'm adult, I can't help and reflect on the fact that this is becoming true.

Sometimes I just want scream at my parents for having me. It's as if they never considered the possibility of their daughter being ugly and alone. Life just feels like a curse.

I'm just going to buy a 12-pack and drink myself to sleep tonight."
3865,I feel so worthless today (depressive episode),"I feel as if everyone hates me and I end up pushing people away, including my sweet boyfriend. I hate myself so much right now. I ruin everything good that comes my way. I don't deserve anything good to happen to me."

I also think many of us want to tell our love ones about our struggles and already consider it carefully and many of us have given up. 

I want to know how many has speak up about the struggles we're all suffering.

I was really banking on this success, I have backup plans, but I really just wanted this. I don't know how I'm going to tell my parents. I feel like such a god damned failure. This was a school when I first applied fresh out of high school I knew without a doubt I was going to get in. Now, when applying I was so nervous, because my college transcripts were marred with failing grades due to high anxiety and depression preventing me from leaving the dorm and succeeding in class. 

I'm trying to get healthy and this feels like no school will ever take a chance on me. I fucking needed this win just this once, my art portfolio was solid; everyone who went to this school told me with the work I had in it, and the concepts I had dedicated myself to that it was a surefire win. I hate, fucking hate that I let myself into this thought process of hell, maybe this will be the change. FUCK. I thought today was going to be a good day. I feel so sick to my stomach. Is anywhere going to accept me? I'm so fucking tired and angry. I know I can't give up and I don't want to, I just want to let my depression take over for a night and just hurt myself. I don't want my partner to see the cuts though, I don't want to relapse with self-harm even though my depression is yelling at me to."
3870,i’m so tired of feeling so unwanted.,i’ve felt this way for years now and yet it’s still so suffocating and unbearable. i cant stand being unloveable. i can’t stand being no ones favorite person. i can’t stand the fact that i’m just a background character in everyone’s lives. i make no sort of impact. i serve no purpose. nobody really needs me. i want to cry but i can’t. i fucking can’t jesus christ can my body just let me cry
3871,"abused when i was kid, bf doesnt get it","i come from a history of abuse in my family. while growing up i witnessed and suffered a lot of screaming and insults, sometimes it got physical.

to this day and age im still traumatized. im terrified of doing something wrong and being yelled at, or of being close to any violent situation again. ive worked at places where this used to happen and it only made my fear and anxiety worse.

ive told my bf this repeatedly but he still reacts strongly to some stuff i do. sometimes he gets mad at something and he's extremely rude and speaks really loudly and it's fucking terrifying to me, i completely shut down and start crying.

i'm sick of him not understanding this. i can't trust him anymore because i've repeatedly asked him to stop doing that and he still does it, which makes me cry a lot.

sometimes i think we're not compatible. he's got anger issues, ive got fear issues, this isn't going to work"

3874,"Seriously, how are there people that are genuinely happy?",I honestly just don’t get how people can be excited to wake up every morning. Everyone just seems so happy and cheerful all the time. Whenever they get sad they are able to quickly cheer themselves up and move on like nothing happened. I honestly don’t get it. Are they just pretending to be happy? Are they lying to themselves that everything is okay? Or am I just a piece of shit? Whenever I wake up I get mad at myself for being alive. Whenever the slightest inconvenience happens to me my whole day is ruined. I feel like I am the only one that doesn’t know how to be happy.
3875,"I just feel broken, lost, and alone.","This is a throwaway account, but I have to share this and get it off my chest. 


Hey all, this is my first post here but I just need to vent and I hope I can garner some advice and support. 

I feel lost. I don’t feel okay and I haven’t for along time. For the past few months, I’ve been better, but yesterday, everything felt as if it was crashing down like a ton of bricks. To kick off a little background information, I didn’t have the easiest childhood. For the first ten years of life, I was with both my parents. My dad was always deployed so we didn’t spend nearly as much time as I’d wish we had. My mother, who stayed with me and my brother, is a really shitty human being. We were starved, she hit us a lot, and she did a lot of weird shit I’m not comfortable talking about here, for my own sake and everyone else’s. However, after the divorce, things were better. Dad didn’t deploy as much and we got to bond way more. We moved back to my home state of California, and that was awesome. However, there was one huge problem. I started eating... a lot. Even given my dad being a much larger part of my life and with my crazy mother out of the picture, I was still extremely depressed. Eating helped cull those bad feelings and thoughts I had about myself. I attribute a good bit of blame to my mother for starving us, and me wanting to overcompensate for the lack of food I had for the while she was around. So, this caused me to gain weight quickly. We move back to the east coast because of dad’s work, and I’m ok with this. I love California, but maybe this will be a nice change of pace? It was not. I got worse mentally, and I ate even more. I ballooned to 320ish pounds by freshman year of high school, and I was well above 250 for all of middle. However, in 8th grade, I met a girl. I thought she’d help fix my depression but it didn’t work that way. She was exactly like my mother, something I didn’t come to grips with for 2.5 years. She was manipulative, conniving, abusive, and did many horrible things that continually fucked me up even more. I tried to kill myself many times during the (very nearly) 3 year span of our relationship. She hit me, screamed at me over nothing, tried to make me feel worthless, and raped me. I’ve gotten over everything but that last part. This, naturally, has made me very afraid of ever dating someone again. The thought of experiencing that shit again is absolutely mortifying. But I’ve been trying to put myself back out there (I dumped her November 2018 btw). Oh and also, for extra background, music was the main proprietor of my choosing to stay alive. Kid CuDi, XXXTENTACION, Scarlxrd, Juice WRLD, and a few others spoke to me in ways that helped me through the shit I was being dealt. Anyways, I digress. So, again, I’m terrified of love, of a relationship, and of finding someone to enjoy life with. 

Here comes yesterday. December 8, 2019 is a day I will never forget. I just feel absolutely torn to shreds internally. When X died last year, I was broken for a few days but I’ve learned to cope. When I woke up yesterday, it was 21 minutes after Juice was pronounced dead. I was fucking torn by that alone. I won’t lie, I did a lot of crying because of it. Then, a few hours later, something hit me that still has me trembling. 

I made a r/ForeverAloneDating post a couple weeks ago and it garnered a few responses, one of which was going absolutely phenomenal. She was amazing to talk to, and I thought I might be in the process of maybe having a real relationship sooner rather than later. Nope. She got a bf. Holy fuck, this stung like a motherfucker man. This is really tearing me apart internally. I thought there was a chance at happiness, but all my hope was ripped out with a single phrase, “I’m sorry for not telling you, but I have a bf.” That’s verbatim, but you get the gist. This just honestly destroys me. I realise I’m young, I really do. But I had to grow up significantly faster than most ppl. So I feel like I’m ahead in my years in terms of maturity from a technical standpoint. At this point, I just am feelingly completely lost. I have little energy and I feel like it’s honestly a lost cause to keep trying my luck with girls. This isn’t even the first time. It just stings a lot more because the way things were going, I had a lot more feelings than anyone else I’ve ever talked to.

I feel broken man, and although I feel a need to hurt myself, I won’t and I haven’t. But fuck man, fuck. 

I’d love some advice, and I’d love to talk to someone. I just need someone with me right now."
3876,Tired of being tired...,"Hey guys, I’m not fluent with this site. Just use it for finding anything I need because you all are the best. 
With that being said, I just wanted to spill out everything in hopes that someone who has gone through or is going through similar can share some insight. Here is me:

I can’t take it anymore. The drives are getting harder since we moved 40 minutes farther. Day in and day out I wake up and just felt like I teleported to the future, but only hours later. I don’t remember the last time it felt like I actually woke up feeling like I rested. As the days get older, I feel like I’m weaker. While I’m on the skinnier side, I could hold my own for the most part. Carry myself well, pick up things. Normally. Now, I find it hard to even pick up myself from bed. I’m tired of being tired. I want to wake up and feel refreshed. I want to wake up and feel actually tired because I didn’t sleep enough. I want control over how I feel. 

You see, I’ve been there. I’ve had the quick solution to the problem that persists. I’ve seen it, have been too close honestly. I’m still here. I’m still fighting. Everyday I ask to just be happy and not fight this exhaustion anymore. I want to be human. I want to feel normal. 

I’ve spent this year spending money on medical visits trying literally everything I possibly can to figure out what it could be. I’ve tried eating habits, sleeping habits, exercising, etc. I’ve tried more than I wanted since it just put me in a debt where I’m just barely recovering now. Up until recently, I’ve given up. It has to be depression. I’ve spent years saying i wasn’t actually depressed. But seeing as though my body does not tell me signs (i.e. when I’m stressed and such unless it’s VERY bad) I could have been depressed longer than I realize and it’s just gotten harder. I have a hard time reading things for class. My mind feels like it’s racing, but stopped functioning at the same time. I have a hard time seeing because it’s like I’m in a slight haze. I actually got glasses when this started thinking it was just my vision kinda going (family all has glasses). My prescription is almost nothing, but as the year went by, my vision as slightly gotten more blurry. My body aches all the time. Through my back, arms, legs, inner thigh. It’s all just ready to collapse at any moment. We have stairs at my house that I tend to fall up on because my legs just give up sometimes. 

Where I think this got worse: almost 3 years ago I basically cheated on my girlfriend (to some it’s not, to others it is. Not physical.) I was manipulated. I was also disgusted by myself. I had such a hatred for myself that even I disowned myself. I like to say I rebirthed myself. I see things in a different light, understand things in such ways others cannot comprehend. I am pretty happy with the person I became out of it. (Details left out because half of its blurry, half I try to forget). About a year later, a tragic incident  happened (would rather not mention) which happened to be my worst fear ever. I wasn’t even involved, but I feel like i was the helpless one. It’s ruined me honestly. It left graphic images in my head that would flood in my mind daily. Slowly, they didn’t come up much but honestly after Over a year since that, it still affects me and it always will. Personally, I believe these two tragedies (in my opinion) have had the biggest impact of my decline as a functioning human being. 

I find happiness out of my day. People I’m surrounded by, my pupper, who I am and all. But  it’s getting so hard to make it home from work... this exhaustion, mental feeling, blurry vision is getting harder and harder to deal with. This season does not help either as it’s gotten colder, so does my mind. I just want to be a normal person. I want to feel the happiness give me strength. Not just feel it in my heart. 

If you read this far, thank you... I know it’s just a spew of my thoughts but I hope that I can relate to someone somewhere about this exhaustion and constant drained feeling. I’m lost in this world and fully understand why it’s hard to reach out to friends. They don’t know what it’s like. It’s more of a burden that they feel bad they can’t help because they have no idea. It’s also tough to put into words so I hope you can understand. 

If you understand what it’s like, you’re not alone. let’s talk. Let’s help each other."
3877,What about when your whole life has been depressing?,"What answer is there to your whole life honestly being depressing? I’m 28 years old and I’ve been depressed since my early teens. 

There is honestly nothing that will change that now, no matter how much medicine I take, how many therapist appointments I go to, or how many times someone says things will get better. Because they will not. Some people are just not meant to have the perfect life and get the things they want. I am one of those people. Cursed with the lucky genetic of mental illness, in a family where every single person has the disease. It has already been the demise of many. 

I wish I could make it better, but I have already exhausted every option and nothing helps."

3879,My libido finally returned a bit,"I started taking Fluoxetine/Prozac around  6 months ago and one of the biggest side effects was my lack of having a sex drive. I literally could not even orgasm for a solid 5 months but in the past month, I’ve finally been able to, kind of. It’s been so hard especially since the lack of sex drive made me lose a very new partner which was disappointing. It’s been a long trip but I feel like I understand myself and my body even better now. It’s been a learning curve. Just wanted to share in case other people are in the same boat because I was miserable honestly for those 5 months. Don’t get me wrong, I’m nowhere near where I was before, but I’ve improved so much. It can get better people, just hold on!"
3880,Watching football/basketball used to be one of my favorite pastimes then I started thinking,"There are incredible human beings out there live my the life I always wanted.  Who they are matters. What they do matters. 

And when they’re not at work or training their bodies/minds with the finest resources America has to offer they’re fucking millionaires wanted by unfathomably beautiful women.

They build legacies that little boys dream of making. Their personality and unique skill set is historically significant. Their accomplishments revered.

The lack of motivation is what really just proves to me im not worth it. How could i complain about not getting anywhere in life when i don't even try. It baffles me how im not even able to finish a single semester of college ,how ? how am i so utterly useless ? Why ? Why am i still alive ? It just doesn't make any sense. I barely exist to anyone as it is why cant i just fully disappear ? And what's so wrong about killing yourself ? Its your own person you should be able to choose when you want to stop living. Im a consenting adult why cant i pay for my burial and get it over with ? I CANT EVEN DRIVE i don't have a license and im 18 soon to be 19 if it wasn't pathetic enough.And to be honest i haven't even really tried killing myself i planned on taking some percocets and hanging myself in june before i ended my senior year of HS but im a pussy and didn't go through with it only adding to my cowardice. Since then I've told no one nor talked to anyone about it and probably wont. I just need to choose i don't know what's wrong with me i act like something in my life sucks when nothing does i have a room a tv a bed to sleep on. Im ungrateful in this state of uselessness i Have to do what's right i Have to i just have to grow a pair and do it."

3885,Ending a 15 year relationship,I am in the process of getting a divorce and I am feeling very low about myself. It was his choice not mine.

I am so nervous and still debating whether or not to go. I miss my friends, but I dread the questions like “so, how have you been doing?” Or “what do you do?”
I’ve been treating and am currently unemployed.

How can I answer them without revealing the fact that I’ve been highly suicidal and am prone to severe panic attacks?"
3887,if i don't kill myself before i graduate college i will be surprised," posted this a couple seconds ago but i forgot my bf follows me so i'm reposting this on a throwaway account because i don't want him to see this.

&amp;#x200B;

so i've been thinking about this for a while. i feel like a failure bc my grades are trash and i feel worthless and dumb most of the time. i know grades aren't everything, but i really want to go to pa school after i graduate from college and my highest semester gpa yet has only been a 2.8, which was what i got this semester. in my defense, i am a biomedical sciences major and i am required to take difficult classes like biology, organic chemistry, physics etc. i feel like i'm the only one struggling and i can't seem to get decent grades despite working my ass off. maybe i'm being dramatic rn but i feel like i don't have a lot to live for. my friends and boyfriend can move on and find someone else to replace me eventually, so if i were to kill myself it wouldn't matter in the long run. i just don't think i can grow up and be a functioning adult, which contributes to me wanting to kill myself before i graduate college so i won't have to suffer through college ad learning how to be an adult on my own. i don't think i can even make it through college at this rate, plus i suck at what i do. i once had a ""friend"" tell me maybe college isn't for me because i'm not making the grades i want, and that felt like a kick to the stomach. but what if he's right? what if i'm too stupid to be in college? as much as i want to stay in college and graduate with a degree, i don't want to suffer through college and be miserable for another 2.5 years (i'm a sophomore). i feel like i can't do anything right, no matter how hard i try. i have friends and a boyfriend who are nice to me, but i'm too afraid to tell them about my depression sometimes because i don't want to drag them down. my ex used to chide me for being ""too negative"" whenever i was open about my thoughts and feelings with him, so now i'm afraid about being honest about how i feel. i feel so goddamn lonely 75% of the time and i feel like life isn't worth living."
3888,My doctor wants to send me to rehab.,"I (19m) went to the doctor today to try and get antidepressants. It’s the first time I’ve been honest with my doctor about how I’m doing emotionally and mentally. I told him I’m here because my girlfriend noticed I’ve been drinking more and have been more agitated and distant. Which I agree with and I know it’s my depression I’ve had for 6 years now. I don’t tell people about it because they get all sympathetic as if I’m fragile. He said that with my major drinking problem antidepressants would make me worse. He said rehab would be better than anything for me because of the constant over watch and company and help. It’s a 2 week thing but I can’t take that much time off work. I have bills to pay, I have Christmas presents to buy. I have shit to do. He said it’s really the only option for me right now. I’m scared to go,  terrified he even brought it up. I need help but I just cant do the most.  I need work. It’s the only thing that wakes me up in the morning and gets me tired enough to sleep at night. It puts a roof over my head and the little food I buy in my stomach. I feel like he focused more on the alcoholism than he did my mental issues I originally went for. I know he means well but it’s an insane idea for me to take that much time off work and be away from everything. I don’t know what I’d tell my parents or how they’d even react. I don’t want them to be worried or have to pay for the parts insurance doesn’t cover. I wish they couldn’t know. I’m scared my girlfriends gonna leave me because of it. She wants me to get better and I tell her I will but I can’t. The military and my parents can’t find out I go to rehab or therapy. I need to hide it from people that get a bill mailed to their doorstep and money taken out of their account. I’m scared of what I should do. Go to rehab and deal with the immense pain and embarrassment I cause my family and possibly take a discharge from the army for my mental issues. OR live like this and have my girlfriend leave me throwing me down a deeper hole ending with me in the ground."

3891,Psychiatrist call back,"Called my psychiatrist like I was told to do by my therapist. I called right before the office closed. It has been three hours since then. I checked the call log and previously he has called me at 7 at the latest, that was an hour ago.

I called because my suicidal thoughts have increased in severity. I feel nauseous. I’m worried that he might not even call back. I feel alone."

3893,Should I stop trying to invite my coworkers?,"It really sucks that this keeps happening.

Every time I try to invite my coworkers to an event of mine, they either:
a. Don’t reply to my messages (75%)
b. Say no (20%)
c. Say yes, but then flake last minute (5%)

I’m honestly trying to make new friends here, but its been a struggle and it’s humiliating how none of them would hangout with me. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. There’s one guy who really seems to hate me. He even called me a bitch. 

I asked a coworker if he could see if the other guys are going to come out with me this weekend. He just sent me a screenshot of another guy texting him ‘probably not’. 

They keep telling me that everyone here is chill and down to hang, but when I do the inviting, no one shows. I’m worried that I’m starting to come off as desperate or maybe I’m trying too hard.

I don’t know, it just really sucks. My love life is nonexistent and my social life is weak, especially since none of my coworkers want to hangout. I try to stay in contact with my friends from school, but they’re all busy with their own lives. 

I have to see my psychiatrist tomorrow morning to discuss tapering of my medications. However, all of the rejections I’ve been experiencing in life (both romantically and socially) has taken a toll on me and pushed me back to a depressed state. :-("

I struggle with figuring out who I am and what is causing the problems in my life, unable to decide my name, my gender, even things like favorite color or movie are impossible for me to discover and it drives me mad. I keep changing my name and usernames and emails near weekly because I dont feel comfortable with any identity i give myself, constantly blowing money on steam making new accounts and buying new games to try and come up with a genre I like but thats beyond me too. I've deleted all my friends at this point because all them were online, planning to get some IRL instead thinking it would make me  better but Ive failed that too and have nobody now, and dont even get along with my family. I struggle with feeling utterly alone, working a job i hate, too scared to get a car or drive, trying to deal with things like anorexia on my own and overall im tearing myself apart and I dont know what to do. I struggle to feel emotions and cant even decide on those either"

3897,Feeling like I failed myself...,"I’ve been taking medication for many years now. I finally was in a good place to decide with my doctor and I to be tapered and taken off. 

Fast forward, I’m not taking medication anymore. I’ve been feeling depressed, suicidal and angry with myself for still feeling depressed after this. 

I know I wasn’t guaranteed a cure but I did everything to help my mental health. I saw a therapist, took my meds everyday, changed my eating habits. 

It just feels like a waste. I failed myself, yet again. And just feel like there’s no hope."
3899,I dont know if have depression. Seriously..,"This text will probably get really messy since I‘m on the phone and I will probably just let my thoughts out so I apologize in advance.

I‘m 21 years old and I really suck at motivating myself and finding reasons to do stuff. I only get most of my stuff done when I really have to do it. I feel like I just barely got through all of my education and I don‘t even know enough for the job I currently have. 

I will start with some reasons that let me think I MAY have depression, even though they aren‘t that much:
1. I sometimes get waves of sadness and I just get really emotional over very little things even though most of the time I don‘t get phased much by a lot
2. I always struggle with getting things done and I think I never finished work early in my entire life. I always procrastinate until the last days and I even did my bachelor thesis in only the last month.
3. I have really weird eating habits where I sometimes eat a lot and sometimes almost nothing a day. Half a year ago I even had a time where wasn‘t able to eat for 1-2 days at all because I would get sick even though I wasn‘t ill.
4. A lot of time I take longer than usual to fall asleep where I keep some chain of thoughts until I get too tired to keep them up. This time ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours sometimes.
5. I have thought a lot about suicide but not always because I wanted to escape my live but sometimes just because I think it would be just fine because you wouldn‘t experience other people being sad about it since you‘re dead. I never tried to kill myself because I think it would be the worst to live a suicide attempt.
6. I feel like I can‘t love something or someone with all my heart, there are always negative thoughts connected to it.
7. also never pursuit things I get interested in because I get too frustrated most of the times after I failed at it.

Reasons why I think I‘m probably not depressed at all:
1. I‘m generally speaking a joyful person when I‘m around my friends and having a goot time.
2. I give a lot of mental support to people I care about by talking with them about their problems and trying to give advise
3. My family doesn‘t think I‘m depressed at all, they say I‘m just lazy.
4. I never got bullied or anything similar at all in my life.

So basically I did this post because I wanted people that have experience with depression to answer me how likely they think it is that I actually have depression or something similar. 

It‘s hard for me to include all my thoughts and feelings into this one post so if you have questions, just ask. 

Depression is a serious problem and I don‘t want to be that person that says „I‘m depressed“ even though I might just have a bad few days"
3900,I just feel like I don’t belong at my new job....,"Ever since I’ve graduated and left college I’ve struggled with depression and not being good enough. At my old job that I took right after college, my boss would say things like “wow you should get your parents a refund for all the money they wasted on you putting you through school” and things of that nature. It was so toxic and it took me down several pegs after being so confident and sure of myself in college. I’ve made mistakes at that job sure, but I was walking into a new industry fresh out of college. I dealt with that every weekday for 2 years. I finally got out of that environment to a new job in NYC and I feel like such an imposter, like I don’t belong. Everyone is so intelligent and capable and even though it’s only my first week I feel like I’ve been useless so far. I overanalyze everything I say. I constantly think to myself that “that was a stupid thing to say” or “they think you’re an idiot” and I get so in my head that I just want to leave. And I know it’s all in my head....but because I’m so in my head I make mistakes sometimes and ask stupid questions and then I make myself feel like an idiot. Everyone is so goddamn nice and welcoming though and it just makes me feel worse.

I don’t know. I just needed to vent this. I just feel like shit and this next week coming up is going to be brutal."
3901,To my friends who chose to leave this world.,"I could never reconcile with the choice of oblivion. I'm not even sure if choice is the right word in this context. I did not understand how the pain in your hearts was greater than the fear of eternal darkness, until I did. I promise you I know the pain. I have felt helplessness, hopelessness and relentless terror. I do not think of you as selfish, because I too have been desperate for rest. I know your perception was narrowed, but please know this, when you left you were never gone. Those who you could not see through your pain, carry you everyday, and they will never be the same.

When you left, you left behind the searing pain that you felt, and shared a piece of it with every single person who loved you. You thought they would heal, but wounds leave scars. This scar they will carry for the rest of their life. Somedays that scar will open and they will feel the pain again. It never full heals and serves as a reminder of the one they loved and lost.

I try to save you in my dreams, in my sleep, while my body tries to rest. Everyday I think of what more I could have said or done, but it doesn't change a thing. I don't know what to do from here, but I will see you in my sleep."
3902,if i don't kill myself before i graduate college i will be surprised,"so i've been thinking about this for a while. i feel like a failure bc my grades are trash and i feel worthless and dumb most of the time. i know grades aren't everything, but i really want to go to pa school after i graduate from college and my highest semester gpa yet has only been a 2.8, which was what i got this semester. in my defense, i am a biomedical sciences major and i am required to take difficult classes like biology, organic chemistry, physics etc. i feel like i'm the only one struggling and i can't seem to get decent grades despite working my ass off. maybe i'm being dramatic rn but i feel like i don't have a lot to live for. my friends and boyfriend can move on and find someone else to replace me eventually, so if i were to kill myself it wouldn't matter in the long run. i just don't think i can grow up and be a functioning adult, which contributes to me wanting to kill myself before i graduate college so i won't have to suffer through college ad learning how to be an adult on my own. i don't think i can even make it through college at this rate, plus i suck at what i do. i once had a ""friend"" tell me maybe college isn't for me because i'm not making the grades i want, and that felt like a kick to the stomach. but what if he's right? what if i'm too stupid to be in college? as much as i want to stay in college and graduate with a degree, i don't want to suffer through college and be miserable for another 2.5 years (i'm a sophomore). i feel like i can't do anything right, no matter how hard i try. i have friends and a boyfriend who are nice to me, but i'm too afraid to tell them about my depression sometimes because i don't want to drag them down. my ex used to chide me for being ""too negative"" whenever i was open about my thoughts and feelings with him, so now i'm afraid about being honest about how i feel. i feel so goddamn lonely 75% of the time and i feel like life isn't worth living."
3903,I was prescribed Citalopram..,"Hi everyone,

During the school year I had trouble concentrating and my mind was wondering all over the place whenever I would try to study. I finally went to the Dr and told him my problems and he prescribed me this drug called citalopram for 30 days. It turns out the the drug is anti depressant and has withdrawl symptoms. Has anyone here taken it before?? if so can please tell me your experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about going to a different Dr to see if I can be prescribed modafinil/alertec"
3904,I'm tired of sentience,"If I could I would get rid of it. Maybe I'd be happy and not deeply suicidal and struggling every day if I just had ignorance to my existence and pains. Sentience isnt a gift for humans, it's a curse. I wish I could throw it away and see if it would make a difference. You know what they say, ignorance is bliss. If that's true I'd gladly take bliss for that little side affect."
3905,I feel like trash,"My depression is so amplified right now. I shouldn't fucking drink alcohol or sniff cocaine. It doesn't agree with me.

I feel like legit dying. 

I hate this.

But it's self inflicted. Prozac + cocaine + alcohol = big no no"
3906,I’m drowning in my mess of a life,"My life is such a mess I have no idea where I should start, how tf am I this fucked up at twenty. I’m so overwhelmed if only my brain will calm down for a second so I can figure out how to go about this mess I’m drowning in. Absolutely no aspect of my life is going okay, my health, my education, my family, my social life it’s all fucked."
3907,You ever want to be sad as a defense mechanism?,"ever been worried of actually feeling happiness because you'd end up sad again so you just stay sad and hope true happiness finds you, and you are still searching."
3908,i hate myself so much,"basically the title. i hate myself so much and i don’t think i deserve good things. it reflects in everything i do. i barely have friends, my grades are shit, all of my clothes are hand me downs bc i don’t like to go shopping for myself. i just don’t think i deserve good things so i sabotage everything that could potentially be good bc i hate myself so much. i don’t know what to do about it. i don’t wanna feel like this but i feel like i’m in too deep with this lifestyle to ever think otherwise about myself. i don’t wanna do or be anything great. i just want to sit by and make it to my deathbed. i don’t deserve anything good to happen to me."
3909,how can i get a diagnosis?,"i don’t want to self-diagnose. i really, really don’t. but, i want to know.

i want to know if i’m really depressed, or just some fat, lazy chum who can’t get out of bed unless it’s to get food. an obnoxious amount of food. 

how can i get a diagnosis? i know this seems really obvious, but i honestly don’t know. i always envisioned it as just popping up at a psychiatrist’s office one day, filling out a form, and boom-if you’re depressed, they call you. if not, end of story. but i really want to know how, like officially know. i want to know so i can try to get help for myself."
3910,Im losing my will to live and I need help,"I have always been quiet about feeling depressed, my family doesnt take things like that seriously, and I never wanted to bring down my girlfriend by talking about it all the time.
I've recently found myself very alone, I'm about 1100 miles away from any family, and my, recently, ex girlfriend is about the same distance.
Today feels worse than yesterday, and yesterday felt worse than the day before.  I can't motivate myself to cook (one of my favorite things to do). I can't motivate myself to even play a videogame or get up long enough to turn a movie on. I can't sleep and have turned to drinking a lot of Nyquil every night to fall asleep. I just started a new job and I'm already having trouble showing up. 
I mostly always feel depressed, but loneliness intensifies it 10 fold.  
I was in the same situation about 2 years ago which resulted in multiple suicide attempts, a week in a state ward, and a lot of scars.
I turn to drinking very quickly when I'm sad, sometimes I can't fight those urges and just smoke weed heavily and distract myself, but sometimes, like tonight, things feel like way too much and I feel like I need to turn to drinking and hurting myself.
I have never reached out to a public forum before and I feel stupid for doing so. I don't know what the point of this post is even.  Strangers telling me they care doesn't matter to me. I want to die, but I don't want to want to die. How does this get better and when? I don't feel like I can live like this."
3911,my parents just dont care,"all my life it was always my other siblings first within the past two years ive gotten some major achievements

and of course they went completely unnoticed

but my siblings ask for anything and they get it almost immediately ive always been the oddball in my family and my parents never cared about me as much as they do my other siblings

even when i need a therapist my parents are taking their sweet time with helping me get one ive been annoying my parents since march to help me get one and i dont know how to get one other than that i just dont think im ready for the diagnosis cuz what if i am faking all of this

idk im sorry to bother yall"
3912,Watching intense horror tv shows/ films as a form of self harm?,"I was wondering if anyone else finds that watching really intense and/or graphic horror tv shows or films gives a similar effect of self harm? I find sometimes when I’m feeling really numb / detached, watching something really intense like a serial killer documentary or a horror film helps to sort of cut through the numbness?"
3913,Rough Fall/Winter - today is the worst.,"I've been struggling for quite a while, but recently had additional anxiety/panic/trauma issues surface. Suicidal ideations and multiple panic attacks per day at the peak. I'm on some new medications and I think it's been helping..... 

But man, today....blows. I know you guys get it when I say that I just feel so empty, exhausted, drained, etc. I can't work up to any feelings other than irritation/anger and overwhelming sorrow. My husband keeps asking what's wrong and I'm getting pissed because I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER! I'm just in a hole. And it keeps getting deeper and deeper.... 

I don't know what my point is. I guess just to have someone listen who understands."
3914,I've destroyed everything,"Everything. I feel like i've destroyed everything, my friends, my situation.

I've just cut down contact with everyone just about 2 hours ago, i don't want to see them ever, i want to quit school, my job... And i start to think that i should end everything.

I don't even know if i'm serious when i'm.typing that, i'ts juste that i've had enough.. AGAIN. My job's shit, i've been treated like shit by everybody, at school, at my job, at my place, there is only my parents who likes me.

This post won't serve at all, like me, i just need to write it, anyways, i don't know if i will see an ending soon, i just want life to end, or start everything again.

How can you surpass it ?"
3915,Don’t want this! (Any tips...?),"I hate being depressed. It’s always a hot and cold ritual. Today I didn’t feel that I was depressed until I got home from dropping the husband off to work. I feel so tired, and I wanted to do so many things today. But I just want to curl in a ball. I want to just stop everything and go to a place of comfort. Which I wish I knew what that was!
I have repressed everything that has been done from my childhood, and now I’m just tired all the damn time. My mom doesn’t understand, and will say you don’t have anything to be depressed about. Why is it so hard for people to understand that depression is not like an off and on switch. Do you honestly think that I want to feel like this?!
I’ve been working on myself for close to three months, and the progress is still so slow! It’s hard to want to help myself because I have always put others well being over my own, and it is one of the hardest things I have had to do. It is always a struggle of, “hey put yourself first today, and be capable of saying no without making yourself feel guilty”. It hurts every time when my mom or husband ask me something to do, and that day I say no. I attack myself unconditionally...then several days later I suffer the consequence. This is always a cycle and it is so hard to break!
I hope with journaling things will get less intense...
How many weeks,months, or years will it be more tolerable?
(Sorry for long rant, just a lot of things going on in this mind of mine..)"
3916,8 years to the day.,"It's been 8 years as of today that myblife was torn apart forever. 8 years since the most important man in my life passed away. I've never been the same since and every year it's the same routine. Hide away and pretend I'm fine while my mind tells me over and over again that it was my fault. That if I hadn't fallen asleep my father would still be here with me. Unfortunately new thoughts of negativity have creeped in and manifested in a dream. Thoughts that my dad would be disappointed in me. Disappointed for dropping out, being transgender, and being attracted to more than just women. It's been so difficult and hasn't been getting any easier. He was gone before I had a chance to make him proud of me. I've found myself pondering suicide again for the first time in 4 years. It's all just been grey since he passed and occasionally someone comes along who makes it better, but they either leave me when I let them in or end up dying or forgetting about me. I have grown so tired of this shit. I have tried using different outlets, but those only do so much. They help, just enough that life feels just a little more bearable, but not enough that when I'm alone or left with my own thoughts, I don't think about taking a bath with a my hair dryer. I hide behind self-depreciation and jokes about suicide so that it will hopefully, but doubtfully, lessen the blow if I ever decide to actually go through with it. tl;dr, I blame myself for my father's death 8 years ago."
3917,I can never catch a break,"It seems like whenever I try to make my life better, I end up fucking myself over. I try and I try, and not only do I fail, I make things worse. I miss the feeling of being loved, having a reason to be happy to come home. I feel like an outcast, a freak, an abomination. My entire life, I just wanted to help people, make people’s lives better, and make the world a better place. And all that has done is drive me into depression and feeling alone. I’m too afraid to attempt suicide again, but I don’t want to live anymore."
3919,I am sorry,I am sorry I have no friends and I am really really retarded I really wish I can be better but I just cant. I cant even pronounce words properly and my brain doesn't know how to learn whatever I make mistakes. I really wish I didn't exist things would be much better cause I am just that dumb. I am so very very sorry. I wish I could talk to people I really do but people have there own lives.  Once again I am sorry.
3920,I am feeling totally broken,"So, something absolutely horrible happened in my life: I just lost my whole chance at an university sponsored internship.

I absolutely hate my life right now. Nothing is working. No one can help me. I feel like nothing is going to work. You can’t understand my emotions right now. They are absolutely broken. They are a pile of mess.

I for my whole life have planned a direction that will never go right. I for my whole life have planned a path that will haunt me later. And now I feel like my dream is impossible. I absolutely hate it all. I hate everyone else around me. I even hate my parents. And when I look at my own face, I absolutely hate myself.

And look at me. This incompetent soul I am who has desperately tried to get 100 retail jobs ever since this happened, but never landed any. Even after checking my resume with others. How stupid I am. I suck. Nothing is working.

My life has no meaning right now. I can no longer be desperate just to save myself. What am I going to do? Nothing. I am the weakest person in this world."
3921,...,"One day I was walking in University and realised that I didn't think or feel since i woke up, was surprised at first but then felt so numb, can you imagine waking up everyday ; talking to people, eating, drinking, playing video games or cards with your friends and not feeling anything it's like you're asleep all the time even worse it feels like you're numb and everything is just pale and dark.
I hurt myself and I can't feel, eat my favourite meal and I don't like it, do everything I once enjoyed and I just don't enjoy it anymore.
I don't know what made me like this or maybe I do, but it's something I lost and I won't get back and that fact killed me and still kills me everyday, it was the barrier that protects me from every bad thing that would effect me but its gone and I tried to walk my path alone but I can't do it, not any more, I'm weak but in the end who's not!"
3923,I feel like an unloved NPC...,It seems like nobody cares anymore and that I'm just the annoying side character that no one loves
3924,nothing left,I dont feel like a person anymore. I lost all my interests and happiness. I feel like a shell of a person and I'm tired of it. Im only living for the people in my life that care. I'm so sick of how much it hurts. I just want to die so I can be somewhere else and stop feeling like this. I'm reaching my limits. I just want someone to see and tell me that I should live and my life is important but nobody is going to say that. Im tired of fighting myself. I'm tired of trying. I don't want to keep trying.
3925,Everytime I get into a disagreement/fight with the guy I'm seeing he ignores me and it really hurts and I sink into depression until I finally hear from him again.,"I feel stupid. We have arguements/disagreements on and off again but we always realize what we did wrong and try to move on. I feel like we should just end contact all together, but everytime we fight and get space from each other, I feel awful. I have crying spells, I can't sleep, I either barely eat or eat too much and I cant focus on anything that I find fun. I'm afraid to call it quits because I hate this feeling so much... I hate that I cant sleep and have horrible dreams and I hate that I have no one to talk to about this and suffer alone. I feel great when we make up, and tell myself this will be the last time we ever get into another tiff, but in the back of my mind I feel stupid because I feel like I should do what anyone else would do and end it but I dont want to sink into this depression again. It just hurts so much. I'm sorry if this barely makes any sense...I'm typing through tears and I can barely get my thoughts together. Has anyone else felt this with an SO?"
3927,How do you know if your depression is gone or if you just can't feel it anymore?,"Cos I thought mine was gone, everything was good but now I'm not so sure."
3928,"The more time passes, the more the consideration of suicide becomes more serious.","I'm considering suicide. It's something I always wanted to do for the past 3 years but I always threw it out of the question as I have a religious past but atheism is really convincing so I wanna start taking steps to fully assure myself that I wont be going to hell so I can easily go through with the suicide.

When it comes to my life there is truly nothing to stay for and all the reason to leave. I'll save you time by ruling out family, friends and career. Those are set in stone dont exist and will never exist and this is not just my hopelessness. It's facts based on my entire lifetime.

There are also seriously horrible things in my life like constant abuse and so many kinds of mental disorders. Even physically I'm at the verge of facing serious health issues as I've been neglecting my health and really any other aspect of my life for the past 10 years. 

My question is. If I am not to go through with suicide, the only alternative is to live in isolation and be slowly eaten up by my physical and mental illnesses. I tried making peace with that. Inventing hope that someday things will magically change but years and years go by and it just gets worse. In the meantime, I have food which gives me that anticipation and excitement to wake up everyday. Desserts and savory they give me a purpose And anticipation so I dont go insane. They numb the pain and dread.

Now it's a point where a life of food doesnt do it anymore. I'm hungry now but I'm not in a mood.to.eat. I just wanna die so bad. I wish i had religious certainty of atheism, i would run to the nearest pharmacy and just escape this life. I wish I had I energy and you had the time and I could prove and explain how each little aspect of my life is designed to be a dead end and horrible so you would really understand my decision.

I talked to many therapist, I had one for a year. Nothing changes. He cant help me because he knows I'm just in an unfortunate situation where cant do anything to help. I'm really in the darkest place in life. I'm stuck and I've never left my house to do something ever. I really dont know how someone can have the patience to spend years passing time in their home. This also caused me really heavy resentment.

And that's another reason.i.want to leave. The resentment towards everything is so powerful and painful, it physically aches my head and I cant keep living in this dread so I need to start preparing for suicide asap.

So the only alternative is somehow continuing to live my life without the pain. Is that possible?"
3929,Plz help,"So i used to be a really happy person. I lived in America, was popular and played football. I also had lots of friends. So you could say life was good. I had a girlfriend to. Then i moved to germany. I made no friends, got bullied because of my height.(im 4 foot 4 in 8th grade). After a while i got depression. I also got sleep disorders from my staying up all night crying because of how bad my life is. I’ve stopped taking care of my hair. I’ve tried skating and I’m actually quite good. But i even get bullied for that. I once accidentally ran over a pinecone with my skateboard. Skaters you know what happens. I fell. I got laughed at so badly. Someone even punched me while i was on the floor and called me a dwarf. It was raining and i still has to wait 3 hours until i could come home. This is probably the worst moment of my life. To add on top of that there has been no one supporting me. There were so Sammy times were i actually considered suicide. Is there anyone else who has gone through this same thing with any advive?"
3930,i don’t know.,"i’ve made this account as a way to reach out and rant(amongst other reasons) earlier today. a while ago, a friend of mine said something about how i always rant to her-as a joke-and ever since then, i’ve never complained, ranted, or anything to her or anybody else. anyway, i don’t think i have depression. i mean, i’m 14-why would a 14 year old have it? i have no social life. the second i walk out of school, the only social interaction i get is with the two people who send me streaks. i have 3 people on snapchat and instagram-1 of which never even bothers with me. i feel so annoying, i hate myself so, so much. i want to die-suicide comes to my mind as naturally as any other thought. but i’m too scared to, and i know i never could. i’m only left to hope that i’ll die by some freak accident on the road or something. sometimes, i don’t have the energy to talk. it’s draining. whenever i’m around people, their conversations are strained. i see it by the way their posture changes when i speak, or how quickly they start talking once i’m done, or how long it takes them to notice i haven’t said a word since days before. but, i refuse to say i have depression. i relate with it, but i refuse to admit it. i refuse to see a therapist, counselor, or talk to anybody about it. my own mother calls me a lazy slob because i can’t get out of bed some days-my dad pities me. i just want out. the only escape i have is the internet. i spend all of my time on the internet, scrolling through instagram and reddit and tiktok. but they never fulfill me. i haven’t laughed at anything for months now-only in school, at times when i make a joke or i am included. my laugh is disgusting-i sound like a pig. my friends joke with me about it, laughing  at me. but it hurts. it hurts a lot how they joke with me about my insecurities but don’t realize how much it affects me. i used to read books, but most end in tears and an empty feeling inside of me because i realize how i’m never actually going to live as exciting or thrilling a life as the characters from my book-how they’re so beautiful, how i’m ugly. how i’m so, so, so ugly. my face is crooked-my eyes too small for my head. and i’m not even exaggerating. i can’t scroll through things as simple as tiktok or even go to school without this burning envy in my chest. and i hate it. i hate it so, so, so much. the only thing that motivates me is my dog-and my dog, he loves my parents more. he leaves me the second my mother coos to him, even if i’m begging him to come back. and it hurts, because even my dog, *MY DOG,* prefers someone else over me. 


i’m sorry for this rant, i just really wish someone understood. 

that’s all i want. 

understanding."
3931,The restlessness has become too much,"I've been fairly successful in my sex life as far as college was concerned, highschool not so much.

But now that I'm unemployed and disabled and living with my parents I just feel so restless without another person beside me.

I miss the passion, (I miss making people cum)

I miss the unfiltered contact 

I cant even look at porn anymore (softcore or otherwise) it just makes me so restless. I see all of these beautiful women and I just feel defeated.

Idk try to write to distract myself but sometimes that can only get me so far. 

Dating apps are a sham."
3932,I feel like I'm crumbling.,"I'm not diagnosed with depression, so I don't know if I am depressed. I just fall apart for no reason.

Apparently people can see it aswell. My manager once came up to me, genuinely worried, and asked me if I was all right. He came up to me because I didn't make any jokes a few work days in a row. Usually I'm always joking around, laughing, making new friends. That's just who I was.

I don't feel like I'm myself anymore. I already have a very, very hard time dealing with my emotions because of my autism, so feeling what ever the hell I'm feeling for the past few months, is yet another emotion I'm unable to control, understand or show. I don't know what it is, why it's happening, what I can do and if I want to live like this.

But I don't want to kill myself. I just want to be me. Sometimes I do think about just disappearing. That would be so easy. Honestly, that would be my dream.

I'm done. With everything. But I hope I get better."
3933,Baked Peanut Butter Cookies Today,"I didnt have much in the kitchen. I wanted to make chocolate chip cookies. No chocolate chips. Wanted to make lemon snap cookies, no lemon. What the heck do I have to make cookies? Peanut Butter, sugar and an egg....why yes I have things. By God chile, you got you some cookies then!

I used organic natural crunchy peanut butter. Came out terrific! Whew! kept the depressive blues away for awhile. Im sipping tea now. I baked 9 of those muthasuckas. Ate 3 of them warm, on site. cooled the others. It was hard watching 6 cookies cool on the tray without eating them. Have you tried? 

I googled 'peanut butter cookies' just to make sure that others were also having the same reaction......holy-st.john-of-jesus'-baptism these cookies are yakkin good! Boy,you bet your neighbors sweet little ass they are!

&amp;#x200B;

I vowed to give them away....yet, here I sit with tea and the last cookie. See, what happened was......DuckDuckGo told me about jam.......yes, damnit, jam. That if you just smear a little of last season jam on top of that sweet little ass peanut butter cookie right here,you might reach the other side of heaven. Yes, lawd. adam ate the apple honey but 'I' baked that damn peanut butter cookie!!!!!!!!!"

3935,I don't feel sad,"I just feel empty, my mom found out that I'm failing almost all my classes. She immediately flipped out. She was yelling at me, normally I'd feel sad, feel sorry, not for me but for putting her through this. She's always an asshole but I still always felt sorry or sad. Now I just sit there. Staring into the void not giving a shit. Which promted her to scream at me more. Again instead of be sad or sorry, nothing. Normally I'd breakdown. But this time I told her the truth, I didn't care. I don't know why I don't care, I just don't. Not about the grades, not about the yelling.  She then got more pissed of and snarkly said ""Well I just think you're lazy"" then I actually did feel. I felt scared. I felt scared that she was right. Scared that what if I'm just making this up to hide the fact I'm lazy."
3936,I had a good run.,"I've lived my life the best I could so far. I had family, friends, experienced love. I ventured out of my comfort zone and did things I never thought I'd do when I was younger. Been places, seen a lot, met a lot of good people. I have my regrets, but it's nothing I can change now. If I died tomorrow, I wouldn't feel bad about most choices I've made.

I just don't feel like there's anything left for me here. I'm at a point where I've sunk to the bottom and I've been trying to turn my life around, but my mental state won't let me take the necessary steps to accomplish my goals. There's no point in goals you can't reach, and no point in life without goals.

Christmas and the new year/decade is coming up soon. I'm going to be alone. I already feel that sinking feeling in my gut, and the tightening of my chest and throat when I think about it. How long will I keep telling myself it'll get better..."
3937,Finally asking for help,"I’ve tried 3 times in the past to register for my university’s mental health support and have always ended up quitting the page halfway through. But finally I’ve managed to fully register and they’re gonna get back to me the start of next week for a first appointed. Feels like a weight has been lifted, can’t believe how long this has taken me. Now I just need to make it to the appointment and not chicken out last minute."
3938,To my friends who chose it leave this world.,"I could never reconcile with the choice of oblivion. I'm not even sure if choice is the right word in this context.

3939,I should've done it,i almost killed myself. Depression has gotten worse and ive been feeling a lot more suicidal since my boyfriend broke up with me. I almost overdosed on my moms pills and I really wanted to do it. I had a half assed suicide note in my notebook and was ready to. I tried calling my ex boyfriend because hes the only person thats ever helped me through this stuff. He didn't pick up. I called the suicide prevention hotline and talked for a while and calmed down. The next morning my ex was worried and I wish I would've done it. i usually dont have the courage but I did then. I lost it. I want someone to tell me not to do it that my lifes important but its not. I feel like I have no one and ive lost all my friends and the only person that cared about me. I wish I'd just be brave enough to do it.
3940,Goodbye,"It’s been a blast everyone but it’s time I can’t handle this anymore I wish you all the best of luck hopefully you don’t take the same route as me. Goodbye

Sincerely what was once a fellow redditor"
3941,I need help,"I’m on the verge of killing myself. If I had a gun I would blow my fucking brains out in a heartbeat. I’m so sick of living. I don’t have a job so I can’t afford a therapist and I just need someone who has experience with helping people. If you have a good heart and want to help but don’t know what to say or do please don’t message or reply, I mean it with as much genuine thankfulness that you want to help but fuck if some says one thing wrong to me I’m going to hang myself it’s become so bad"
3942,I'm not going home for Christmas,I've told everyone I'll be there.  Planning to develop a nasty illness a few days before.
3943,Psychologist told me to leave job - family against it,"So currently my psychologist told me to leave my job.
My family are completely against it and want me to keep working, even though the psychologist has said that I will probably lose my life if I keep working there either by heart attack or my own doing.

I am paying off a mortgage, partner works full time.  We would get by but definitely be doing it tough.  My partner wants me to leave and has wanted me to leave for a long time.

I guess as I’m writing this out I’m more worried of their opinion then anything, which I shouldn’t be.  Thoughts?"
3944,I am tired.I give up. Help me.,"It's been 8 hrs. I don't know what's wrong. 
But it's in my head again. I try to get over it. 
I feel helpless. I can't keep going to my therapist always. Depression sucks man. It fucking sucks. 

I want to socialize and meet people but am so scared due to what happened when I met the last time. 
It just strucks you like lightning and I want a blanket and a room that's all. 

Please help. I feel helpless. Sometimes I even feel like therapist just want money that's all."
3945,I don't know what to say.,"I'm tired of living, that's really the best way I can put it. I don't really feel anything like ever. I got out of a four year relationship recently, you'd think I'd be devastated, I'm not. I know I should feel something over that, but I don't. I'm dating a new chick, feel nothing for her. I've been in an emotional purgatory for years now. I should be grateful that I have a job and a girl, but I'm not. All I can really think about is ways to escape my life. I've long mused if the emptiness I feel inside is merely a result of the capitalist system; everything seeming to be so artificial so geared towards mindless indulgence/consumerism. The only thing I really feel is hopelessness. I feel like I'm a prisoner of the system, I go to a job I hate everyday because I need to earn money which immediately goes towards expenses: (student loans, gas, ect) I live paycheck to paycheck. The futility of it all is fucking soul-crushing. I'm utterly exhausted with the tedium life and I don't want to go on anymore. I wish someone would just put me out of my fucking misery."
3946,I hate life a lot,Life is just really hard for me I mean I am not getting abused or anything but I get picked on everyday people always say negative things to me and no one wants to have a conversation with me I don't ever have friends that want to hang out and I just sit in my room from 3:50 pm till 8:00 pm doing nothing everyday I play games sometimes but I wish life was more interesting
3947,I want to die and the room is spinning, Just dru k hey.  Ig f I died eould any9ne care. Does my life after? I've been saf since. 13 and I'm 23. Hurray for meeee
3949,I’m getting better :),"Hey all, I have been depressed for awhile now and was really looking for help. I am getting better each day from a caring community that I have found from [Helponymous.com](https://www.helponymous.com) and thought I would share with the group here. It’s way of my favorite places to go when I’m feeling down on myself. Hope you’ll all enjoy it as much as I do"
3950,i am tired of the earth.,these people. I am tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.
3951,I feel I need recreational drugs just to get through the day,"I used to drink heavily then I started smoking pot and now I do so almost everyday. My brain never shuts up in every sober moment. Even though I'm lucky to be on good anti depressants and be getting other treatments, I feel it's all just not enough. I hate being insane, and I can't help but feel pathetic."
3952,Self Esteem/Confidence YouTube Channels &amp; Vids?,Hey everyone. I'm looking for YouTube channels and/or videos that can help teach me how to improve and build my low self esteem and confidence. Any suggestions? Please and THANKS!
3953,Does anyone else feel like they don't know how to process emotions?,Like when something really bad or stressful happens sometimes I'm hit with a huge arrange of emotions and they all hit at one time. It's like flipping a channel really fast only to rest on one channel for an hour or so then back to changing channels. It eventually stops but by then I don't know if I probably process what needed to. Is it just me???
3954,I get overwhelmed so easily.,"When I think about daily normal activities—doing the laundry, folding the clothes, driving to work, concentrating at work, changing my clothes, taking a shower, washing my face in the morning, putting deodorant on—I just feel so overwhelmed. It’s as if it’s too much to do or handle. I know it has to do with psychomotor retardation, so it has a biological aspect, but I still wanna know how I can better cope with this overwhelming feeling. Any advice, kind and lovely Redditors?"
3955,Do you ever feel stuck between reaching out and feeling like those who do are fake?,"I live six and half hours away from home where I've been going to school for four years now. I'm the only person from my school to come up here and knew absolutely no one when I came. I've met plenty of people who id say call me a friend. But recently I've been feeling so beyond isolated. I struggle with depression and anxiety with bipolar as the Cherry on top. And with that I care about people so much and try my best to reach out and provide whatever I can to whoever I can. But no one does that with me. No one. I haven't gotten any texts asking how I've been or even just trying to hangout. I don't get invited out anymore and I can feel myself isolating myself now as this cloud of depression keeps looming over me. I want someone to talk to someone to tell about all of it to confide in, but I have no where to go. I have no true friends here or anyone who I feel is real enough to have these kinds of talks. When people ask me questions it's the novelty shit and it's never real and I feel pressured to lie and pretend I'm alright. I wish I wasn't stuck. I wish I wasn't like this."
3956,"Wellbutrin started to work on day 7. Jeez, I still have hope","The first 6 days, I felt like...shit. 💩 I ended up dropping out days ago. The first 6 days, I felt super anxious, depressed and suicidal. But on the 7th day (today), I feel mentally and emotionally stable. I don't feel suicidal anymore. But I cannot sleep..."
3957,I hate doing everything more and more every day,"Keeping up with chores becomes more and more annoying, don't even get me started on all the other things that I need to do, house maintenance-wise and general errand-wise. I burned out so fast this school semester, I'm so ashamed, but half of me just doesn't care and doesn't want to do anything with life anymore. 

Even the things I liked doing just annoy the fuck out of me. I'll sit down/go out to engage in my hobbies and just internally shut off. They're chores too now. 

I hate everyone more and more every day. I just want to spend the rest of my life in isolation. You can't tell anyone that or they get really uncomfortable though, so I do my best to act socially acceptable. Sometimes I slip and cut someone out of my life like they were nothing, and it's just making me hate myself even more. Wooo. What the hell am I doing with myself, making so many wrong choices every day of my life"
3958,Being an introvert is a living curse.,"Yes, you might have better judgement and be more productive, but social interactions are just not the same as being an extrovert. I have trouble understanding why people like to socialize so much, yet I feel alone too much."

3963,Life dynamics.,Does anyone else feel that life is intended to be a constant struggle? Because in my life I've noticed that when I'm just hanging around in limbo that is when I'm in the most pain. It seems to be struggle that makes me feel anything at all. A total crisis is different though. That I can do without.
3964,"I don't want to trigger anyone, but this decade is ending.","And it seems so am I. I, for an interesting change have decided that 2020 is my definitive last year. I have a date(s) (I will explain the plural) set! I'm excited. Because at least this is fucking movement in some direction. I'm also very anxious but I guess that's given. Not ODing, it's either wrist slitting or balcony. 

I'm 22, male. Here is how the decade has been for me. I'll keep it short ish because you know what? I type and I type and I speak and I speak yet nothing ever goes away. 

- Lost the one and only gaming friend I ever had, in fact he got me into gaming (he was my much older sister's boyfriend), to cancer. I still am traumatized (she's coped with it well, and that's honestly amazing - she's in such a good place now career wise) because video games were all I had, and one day we were Playing Portal 2 co-op and one day he never came online again, and the next thing I know, he died. 2011.

- Lost my grandfather before an important physics exam, and I still think about him. I'm ridiculously young in comparison to my siblings (they're both 40 ish currently) and all I remember of him was that I never knew him knew him, but he loved me. I couldn't understand and I lost that chance. 2015

- My brother died. Older brother. He was heavily autistic and I had an incredibly turbulent relationship with him, he used to get violent and I used to give it back. For the longest time I thought mom dad and everyone else loved him more, they just really ignored me and I was off doing my own thing in a corner. It was mostly video games and TV and though they tried their best, I felt like a footnote all through their lives. But anyway, he passed in 2016 and I never got a chance to repair the relationship, and I was fully intending to. I had made numerous attempts, and was on the track of actual progress. Never happened. 2016.

- My aunt (mother's sister) died to cancer. She was the glue that held together the extended family and boy, did she take down all of mom's nerves with her passing. Mom has honestly become... Unstable. She's 60 and sometimes when we get into fights she goes into full breakdowns and gets hysterical. I hate them (I will explain why). But I miss her. She always made me felt like I mattered, and was allowed to take space or celebrate my consistent good grades - more than my own parents, who had their hands full so much that I could've died somewhere along the line and they wouldn't know. 2017

- But perhaps the biggest, deepest loss to me is that of my dog. Happened just a few months ago. He was the only constant in my life. I loved him beyond words and when I spent two years away from him in college, my biggest fear was that he'd be dead and I wouldn't be there. That happened anyway. I went away for a weekend to my other sisters, he died of bloating (it had happened before, I had saved him and the vet had told me a quick way to make the suture myself to let the gas out). No one called me. My parents used to try and call my sisters to check up on me to make up for their overall shitty negligence, but when the one literal source of comfort in my life dies, nothing. No calls. Nothing except for a 5s missed call at 4 am. I come back, they've gotten rid of everything of his. I had to fight to get it all back, and I fucking went to the grave site and dug it all the way though I had to stop. I couldn't make out his face. I still fucking hate them for ""trying to protect me"". 

Anyway random stranger, that's that. I'm choosing to go because a) All of the above has rendered me hopeless but as a child, I've always had OCPD and the induced depression that comes with it, so it's not just a product of me reacting to all these deaths - one day when I was 12 the world suddenly turned fucking grim, and that was that; b) I really really want to physically harm and hurt my parents, though that's not fair. They're old geriatrics who've lived a pretty tough life them self. They disgust me, though and so instead of living in perpetual anger and sorrow, I'm going to die Q1 2020. When I said dates, I meant that I have a mathematical average of all the 5 death dates and I'm planning on going on that. 

Have I tried therapy? Yes. Feels wonderful for one hour! Then it's back to the fucking void. Have I tried medication? Yes. A lot, actually. Most of it makes me sleepier, lazier, that's all. Except that brief period of Adderall that made me angrier. Working out? I try every day but my body is literal trash. These fucking genes are rotten and I would like to have the last satisfaction of tearing them out of my body. If I can't harm others (and as much as i want to, I can't - too many years of coding to unravel that side) I can at least go way beyond on my own body. 

I have looked for help, I have tried it, and I am sick of waking up every day wanting to slice up my family's throats, only for that thought to be quickly turned into wanting to slice up myself, only for that thought to be quickly turned into ""wow then I'll never be able to reach my fitness goals, the one thing that might actually make me like myself"". So it's like this scream bubble trapped in me. It's 4 am now and boy would I love to punish my 70 year old dad for his hideous family planning and for his  idiot wife. 

Goodbye reddit."
3965,Ready to go,"Drunk, lonely and tired of everything. Doctor put me on sertraline, didn’t help. I’m so tired... I don’t even know why I’m writing this, I just feel so fucking alone."
3968,Broken and numb,"I don’t wanna feel anymore.

I thought playing sports will give me fulfillment in life but that was not the case. I’m still numb and broken from the many mental breakdowns from the past summer."
3969,I need to just put this out into the world to help me get by,"Ive struggled with moderate depression most of my life but i usually get by.  I have long swings of good times and bad times.  The holidays are always pretty rough due to my best friend passing  during this time of year and honestly the holiday season never held any positive memories from my childhood.  Also, my fiancee' s brother passed the day after xmas 6 years ago.  My mother in law still can't cope with the loss and i know my fiancee struggles every year with the loss plus dealing with her mom.  It makes the whole month dreadful.

We usually go out of town and do something non traditional to escape the pain, even though its financially hard (im a seasonal worker and dont have much work in the winter).  Well this year we have to cancel our plans because one of our dogs tore her ACL and needs a $2000 surgery.  Money is already tight and we have to care for the dog heavily  for the next 3-4 months while she rehabilitates.

The timing couldnt have been worse, i was planning on buying the ring and officially proposing (we have been together 7 years) so that i might add some bit of happiness to this otherwise abysmal month. 

I guess what im really trying to say is why now? Why is it always this time of year that everything crashes down around me? Even though there is a freight train of other problems in my life that i can usually deal with im just completely deflated right now.  

While it feels slightly good to just put this out into the world right now i also know ill probably just mask all the inner pain by drinking/working/distracting myself.  Its worked enough for the last 30+ years right?

I think I've kinda lost focus of what this post was supposed to be and now im just spilling out of the dam i have built up to contain the mess that is me.. uggg.  Just posting this is flooding me with emotions bubbling to the surface and pushing out tears that source from pain i have buried over the decades. Just need to breathe and focus..

I guess to close this post out,  anyone struggling during this time of year.. you are not alone. Its every fucking december for me with highs and deep low's leading up to it. We just have to continue to push back against the darkness at every turn. Seek out the small moments that do make you happy and strive to create more of them.

3970,Why can’t we just be more like other animals?,"I keep buying online lottery tickets. Not because I’m addicted but because I see it as my only way out. I feel stupid. I spend €100,- on 50 lottery tickets the past two weeks. I never spend so much on it in such a short time. I started buying them about 2 months ago from the money I earn with my part time job.

I feel like I walked into another man made trap. But I just need a lot of money to escape from here. I don’t want to keep being a slave to this society. Working hours for money just to give it away for something else. All of this is just so stupid.

Why can’t we just be more like other animals?"
3971,bad day today,"I feel like i have to give up on trying to find people to be friends with that understand my issues and accept them.

I seem to go through these phases of being completely shut off from the world because i feel so down, if anyone tries to talk etc to me I'm worried i will say something wrong so i don't let them have the opportunity."
3972,I hate myself and you would too,I hate myself and you would too... I wish I was someone else.
3973,What are the 3 most effective tools for managing depression - hands down in your opinion?,"i've been trying to wrap my head around this for ages. Every time I fall in to a debilitating depression pushing me to the brink of complete nothingness I tend to google the words - ""depression"", ""immediate help with depression"", ""stop depression"" and so on. I think based on some research I have done - that this is VERY common.  


I usually land up doing a free ""mental health assessment"" - like 15 questions and if I haven't been tricked in to signing up for some shitty service I get the results and for some reason this kinda helps!  


What are your go to's?   


I've come across of a few but I'm not sure what works for most people. Like if I have a family member or a friend who's definitely going through serious anxiety or depression - how do I recommend something useful... without telling them... ""READ THIS WHOLE BOOK""?

Things like:  


 \- Meditation  
 \- Awareness of the symptoms of depression  
 \- A medical/scientific approach explaining the chemical imbalance and how this can be cured or managed.  
 \- Positive feedback on the good things they have in life and how depression is something almost anyone can beet with the right tools... etc  
 \- Eating right

\- Monitoring when your bout of depression really kick in to find route causes."
3974,If I have to live in my house for even 1 more year I will slit my throat,
3975,I feel like a total failure,"Today I learned my coworkers are fed up with me messing up, which I had no idea about until corporate wrote a note to me. They won’t even acknowledge me now. And recently I overheard my managers mention that I’m causing issues, which, again, is all new to me. All this got to me today, and I ended up having to go to the bathroom and cry very hard for a good ten minutes (I almost never cry that hard).

My depression has been very bad lately. Four years ago this month, two of my cats passed away within twelve days of each other. Now my dog is in the hospital. On top of that I still haven’t recovered from everything that happened to me back in 2015 (it’s a long story), and my family can’t understand why it’s so hard for me to move on.

I feel like such a failure for not achieving my goals, for being the only family member that doesn’t own a house or hasn’t left my first job, and for just being an overall disappointment in life. Sorry this was kind of a mess to read, but I just can’t take much more of this."
3976,"Need some coping mechanisms to calm down, I'm too depressed to study for my finals","This past week has been fucking horrible. I’m failing two of my classes. If I fail the one certain one again, I have to switch my major, I can never take another computer science class again. My dad even told my mom that I wouldn't be able to do it, and that makes me feel even shittier. It’s been my dream to be a CS major since I was a kid. 

The girl I’ve been talking to for a couple months now, first girl I’ve dated in years, asked if we could take a step back and go slower and more casually since she claimed she’s afraid of commitment. My friend saw she updated her Tinder so clearly that just means she doesn’t like me. I wish she would just tell me that. She said she still likes me and is afraid of losing me but I really don’t believe it. In the beginning she seemed so excited to be talking to me and claimed she wanted to try dating me even though she had those commitment issues. It was so nice to have someone that was excited to talk to me. Now I’m lucky to get a response every few hours. I really fucking hate the idea of being strung along like this, I asked her just to end things over the phone if she only wanted to be friends a few nights ago so I could focus on studying and she insisted on meeting up to talk and then dropped all that confusing shit on me. I'm terrified of rejection, and so the idea of knowing that rejection is looming is so much worse than just getting rejected and moving on.

I guess I do have friends and some of them are really great but I just feel so fucking disconnected from everyone right now.

I’ve hardly been eating the past couple days, I get so stressed and depressed nothing tastes good even though I feel really hungry. I’m on the verge of tears but I can’t fucking cry. I haven’t been able to sleep much at all for the past week or so. I maybe get 2 or 3 hours. My friends keep asking if I'm okay, I keep spacing out and just staring into space, I can't complete any tasks right now. And on top of everything I’m broke. And I'm about to be fired at work for being late too often, I can't afford to lose my job, I'm really really afraid.

I need to do something so I can focus for long enough to study, I need to get good scores or I’m so so so fucked and I’m really really terrified right now, what can I do to get some relief, even if just enough to be able to study?"
3977,I want to commit suicide before 2020,And while I'm still a teenager. I have no reason to be excited for a new decade and my life would only get worse in the next few years anyways.
3979,Good byes,"does telling your parents that you want to die result in a good way ? 

or you just kill yourself and just be over with it ?"
3980,Day 2 of taking meds and i kinda feel a sliver of hope that they will work.,But the wait is agonizing. They should start working in about 2 weeks so yeah if they work ive managed to kick nicotine and start meds so this will be a good wrap for the year but if they dont then im afraid this will be it. I will finally do what has to be done and blow my fucking brains out lol. Figure of speech. No ill just hang myself but yeah only embers remain and i hope they are enough.
3981,Am I a coward for not being able to kill myself?,"I realize that I'm such a fucking failure that I also fail in ending my life. I tried with a gun that my father has but I'm to pussy to just pull the trigger. And is just moving a finger and thats it... all my pain and miserable life will just go away, by just moving a finger. But I can't. 

In the last few days I also tried jumping in front of a train but every time I go to the train station I just stand still watching the trains going and coming. I guess I don't have any courage.

Maybe I should try getting high or drunk. I'm 28 and I never got drunk or did any drugs. Sober all my pathetic life. So maybe I need that, maybe alcohol will give me that little push I need to stop being a fucking coward.

Sorry for venting out here about my struggles, even though I learned to be a loner and having no one by my side, sometimes I feel like I want to express a little of the shits that I go through."
3982,I don't want to be around myself anymore,"Hi, i have never posted here so here i go.
I have had a shit year, i worked at a job where they treated me like i wasn't good enough to hang around.
I spent all my money on food (that's how i try to kill myself) i have a friend who i practically baby sit and she comes to me for everything so i helped her with her break up over some boy, on the day i lost my job. I pretty much was on self-harm watch for 24/7 for a the full week, no sleep and felt sick to my stomach from worrying... now she got wayy to attached to this guy who didn't abuse her and she thought he was an angel. He didn't want anything serious and she had a full mental breakdown down, and came crying to me... never really asking how i am doing... recently she has had other family problems and mental health problems so she is on a break from the internet, she called me bc she was scared to go home and face her family, but the day after she only gave me one word response's and kept me in the dark, after everything i do for her she goes and treats me like i am just some acquaintance. I've known her for a year and she has done drawings with me and her in them and done papers about me for her homework, about people you can count on ect. 
So i can't hate on her, but i feel like i gave her everything she needed, she sees me as her brother and i see her as my sister (not related). I just wish she would treat me with some respect some times. 

My family are extremely critical about everything i do, i can't leave my room to have a shower in the morning without being asked about 3+ questions... I can't handle people when i am done working i have lost count on how many times i have mentioned this to my mum, she still gives me shit for being ani-social, but when it's the weekend and i hang out with her and her bf it's like ""not normal"" bc i am apparently ""antisocial"".
I'm always being treated like i am a child and like i can ever do anything right, i gave up on looking after myself and keeping my room clean. I know they are angry at me so i will have to work on that.
I can't saty in the shower too long bc i will steam the room up. 10 minutes tops, it's the only place i can think and have an excuse to get away from people. My dad is always talking down to me and making feel like i will never amount to anything. Simply put.

I now work at a job where i have no time for anything social activitys and one of my best friends is almost angry at me for not being able to hangout.

I feel alone and lost, but thank you for listening to my ramblings."

3985,Tired of the fight,"Hey Redditers, I've been lurking here for quite a while but now I feel it is time to let something out to whom it might be worth reading.

I would like to apologize for errors in my English, I live in the Netherlands so English is my second language.

I come from a family suffering from depression, the side of my father all struggle with this illness in some way or another. My sister struggles with it, I struggle with it. Compared to my family I dodged the bullet, my depression can take me by surprise for certain periods, but it is not as 'bad' or 'present' as with the rest of my family.

Around the time I was 16 my father told me he couldn't handle it anymore and wanted to commit suicide. I told him the same hurtfull words that I have heard multiple times: 'Just sleep on it or do something nice, it will go away'. Luckily my father is still around to this day.

Around ten years later I found out that the way i was feeling, the way my own head was punishing me for everything i did, say or think wasn't 'normal'. I always thought this was the way everyone was feeling and was often surprised by the fact how people could just continue with their lives day after day like nothing held them back. I was told by my therapist i suffered from depression, just like the rest of my family, and that this wasn't something everybody around me lived with. It was a relief knowing that not everyone around me felt this way. But is was hard to accept that i felt this way... why me?

Years passed, and i started to recognise my depression more and i was able to fight against it. I started to recognise the shadow lurking by my side telling me i couldn't do stuff, was worthless, unlikeable. There are days I can tell my shadow to sodd off, there are days he overshadows me. But all this time I am fighting, and I continue to fight knowing this is possible.

A couple of weeks ago, i was told my father has cancer. Today i will be driving him to the hospital, tomorrow he will have his bladder and prostate removed, hoping that will stop the cancer spreading.

This made my shadow stronger, but knowning i can fight it still gives me the energy to overcome him.

Three weeks ago, i was told my uncle (suffering from depression his whole life) has taken his own life, he wrote a letter and took all his anti depressants at once. He was 62 years old. This hit me real hard, and you can image, my father being the older brother, is devastated.

These are the days my shadow is stronger than ever, the fight becomes more troubling and more intense. My fight with my shadow was something i thought that was possible. But seeing my uncle, losing the fight after 62 years. Is it truly possible? After 62 years of fighting, thinking: no more.

What I am trying to say is, coming from a family living with depression I am quite used to it. But this is the first one of us to succumb under the pressure and it makes me scared for the future. I am 32, am i able to continue this fight for more than 30 years?

Thank you for reading, typing this has made me feel a bit better. If someone has experience with coping with something like this please let me know. Or if you're just curious about things, ask me anything.

Thanks."
3986,My depression," 

I have been meditating, and going deep into my mind and trying to find the root of my depression... I think I've realized that the reason I can't get better, is because the root of all of my ill feelings is due to civilization. Civilization puts us into chains, and prevents us from truly living free. I don't want to continue living in a world where it's okay to benefit from slave labor. Where it's okay to abandon our principals and our fellow humans because of something as stupid of what clothes we wear.

I think humans are lost, and stagnating. Civilization has ruined me, as well as it has ruined humanity. I don't hate technology, but I do hate how its used. I hate how cities are formed. How the black plumes of smoke and melted snow made from humanities indignant warmth has disconnected us from what matters.

No one knows what we need anymore, because people have created illusions over wants, and turned them into needs. We don't need any of what we have. In fact I guarentee 60% of the population being generous couldn't survive even a week in the wild WITH help.

Idiocracy is coming to life, humanity has fallen, and everyones hoping that planting a few trees is going to be enough to restore our connection to our world.

It's a start but I can't stand all of the senseless hatred and self projection towards those who ARE changing things. when I read ""Who does Greta Thunberg think she is, she hasn't even done anything and she gets on time magazine?!"" Of course that's a NICE quote. All I see is ""well I could do that too if I wanted to... I am so jealous of her oppurtunities to thrive and spread messages of wellness, and since I can't do that I am just going to be angry and repeat what the senseless masses are saying""

In the end none of you deserve this world. In the end none of you deserve the people who are trying their best to make this world livable for us all.

Your idea of charitable is throwing some money in a bucket, or buying someone something, and then what? Expect them to reciprocate because they now owe you something?

Goddess knows I don't owe anyone a goddamn thing. So maybe sometime in the future I will completely forsake this damn civilization. This thing no one wanted but the rich ass holes forced on us. For the sake of oil, and power and gold.

Freedom no longer exists. Justice no longer exists. But maybe they never existed in the first place.

To have thoughts of your own is a worse prison than ignorance. To have a world that you are not compatible with is an uphill battle that in the end we all lose.

I am tired of having anxiety for the sake of others feelings. I am tired of feeling indebted to people who think they are being kind to me. I am tired of forcing myself to give every little crumb that I am for a society that wouldn't miss me.

I have given you all my light, and all that's left is this pit in my stomach that is crumbling beyond repair. I am ruined.

This humanity, this civilization, this system. It has ruined me, as much as its ATVs ruin mountain sides, and destroys eco systems.

I am ruined...  
I am tainted...  
I am apathetic...  
and most of all... I am no longer lost.

I am going to live MY life, the way I deem it, even if it kills me. Because everyone dies. and I am no longer going to sacrifice myself for a people who would see me and the world dead anyway.

Fuck your borders, Fuck your laws, Fuck your debts, Fuck your polite society, and most of all FUCK ANYONE WHO GETS IN MY WAY!

&amp;#x200B;

(I wrote this almost as a way to turn my depression into maybe anger or motivation or something other than depression... but I can't seem to stay angry. I can't seem to stay motivated for anything. I feel so stuck and I really don't know what to do. I feel like I'd rather be angry because then at least I am feeling something other than this mucky swamp I am trudging through. If this isn't the right place for this then take it down.)"
3987,It's back again," It's back the felling that makes me want to suicide because nothing is happening like I really want it and I can't do anything to make it happen, I only have one last chance but it's not going to happen"
3988,I will lose my dad soon and I'm worthless,"I'm 32. Struggled in college. Most of the dreams/goals I had thought I'd have done by now were held back multiple times because of my depression and struggle with school. I finally had a chance to move forward this fall, but my mom passed away in July. I tried to stay positive and focus on school, but walking around campus...feeling out place...feeling like I'm a ghost...worthless...like I'm in a bad joke...I keep thinking of the things I'd promise my mom now that things were going to be better. I came home from school October 14ish and been in my room mostly since then. All I know is it was July and now it's December. I thought about joining my mom. I don't want to let her be alone. I thought a past relationship and how broken hearted I was and then I asked myself why...for what...what does it all matter anyway...through out this time my dad has fallen down multiple times. Finally, I was not awake when he had one of his recent falls...broke his hip...came back home..fell again..and again...and every time I feel like death is creeping outside my room. And I wish I could capture it...see it...and beat it up. Tell it to go away. But I can't. I caught my dad at the kitchen table few weeks ago...he came down with some infection and he isn't recovering. My sister just text me to go say goodbye....
I'm broke you see...I've been my parents care taker of sorts...ruined my semester at uni because I stopped going...do I even want to go back...I don't want to burden my sisters for money...and when I think of working...how can I when I'm like this...you should see my room...it's a shit hole. I'm supposed to be taking a shower to get ready but instead I'm here writing this out....because I think I'll fall back into a really bad depressed state worse than it's been this past few months...I wish I could go away....somewhere far...start a new life...or just disappear"
3989,My dreams show me how lonely I am.,"My dream was so simple, I was walking through a store alone. There were people in the store but I couldn’t make out faces. I was making my way through the crowds when all of a sudden someone yelled wait up. I felt someone bump into me and
 grab my shoulder lightly from the back. I turned around and there was this girl she moved her hand from my shoulder down to my forearm and intertwined our hands. I looked at her and we both smiled. A warmth came over me that made me feel as if I was on fire as we continued walking. 

Then I woke up and realized I’m so lonely something as simple as holding hands which 95% of the population wouldn’t even think twice about means so much to me it’s a dream. Honestly I can’t help but laugh thinking about how pathetic the situation is."
3990,I used to wish for cancer how sad is that ?,"I remember when my depression was at worst i used to wish for cancer so i could die without anyone blaming me and even feel sad for me.

How sad is that honestly ? to wish for the most hated disease.
The irony of all this is that i might have testicular cancer now.
(nothing confirmed but have a small ``ball´´ inside my sack) planning on going to doctor next week for a check."
3991,Could it be my lifestyle?,"These past few days I have treated myself like utter shit. Yesterday I was up till 3am and the day before I went to bed at 7pm and now today I slept through school after telling my parents I felt sick. I always eat junk food and mostly its because no one in my family bothers with making meals or going to the store unless we need to. I have a definite screen addiction and its hard for me to socialize. Im not always like this , just last week I was out running 2 miles every night and powering through school. But then a teacher I knew pretty well turned out to be a convicted predator. I also have body image issues mostly due to my acne. Some days I sit in bed and think there is no point in anything and that its all useless in the long run. I dont get jealous of others but I hate when people look at me and have that instant judgment. They see my eyes that are strained and have bags under them and they see my acne, not to mention my hair that I dont know how to properly style. Also I cant wear normal clothes like my peers cause of my tall skinny weird body shape. I have a select few items of clothes i can wear and when everything is durty or has been worn I often sit there and panic and wonder that I better find something before school starts or Ill be late and my parents will yell. Back on the topic of food-I dont eat at school or in public because I just end up feeling gross and fat. This leads me to binge at home. This leads me to also hate and products of any sort , such as lip balm lotion hair gel deodorant, it makes me feel weird but I still put all of them on to keep up my hygiene. I always take 2 showers per day. I had been taking them cold to make me feel more alert and awake but I resorted back to hot showers where I end up never wanting to leave them. Overall I think if I was just good looking I could live a normal life easy and have a girlfriend and hang out with friends but its not like that. Everyone is scared of me and Im scared of them. I already have my escape planned and ill have a fresh start soon enough though. Only 8 more months."
3992,I haven't been genuinely happy in 5 months,"I've had a few moments I'd consider to be mildly interesting but other than that it's been absolutely horrible. I know it's my own fault but I fucking can't help it, I just don't care about anything anymore. I've just realized that my life is absolutely pointless and there is nothing to do, I don't know how long I  will last any more. The only thing holding me alive is my family, I can't let them down more than I already have. I don't know what to do it just hurts all the time you know"
3993,Talking to happy people bugs me,I just feel overwhelmed by their energy. Can't keep up.
3994,Will quitting my job make things worse or better?,I have so much anxiety about every awful social interaction at work. I have a job where I have to travel and drinking is encouraged on these trips which leads to massive guilt spirals the next day/week/month. My spouse has encouraged me to quit to get better. This will put us in a worse but manageable financial situation. But I’m worried that if I quit I will just lay in bed all day and be even more depressed. Any thoughts?
3995,Don't have therapy for three weeks. Very worried I may hurt or kill myself without it.,"I started therapy 3 weeks ago and it's helped me a lot, but I've also already started to rely on it heavily. I find myself not caring about anything outside of therapy, but when I'm in the room I'm able to say everything and let it all go. But I have no outlet for that outside of it. No one to talk to and no one who cares enough to listen. 

It's done me good but at the same time made me realise I have no one in my life to talked to on a deeper level. 

Now being 3 weeks away from it makes me concerned for myself. I feel myself slipping. I've already started self harming again and the suicidal thoughts are constant. I know I'll do it one of these days for real if I don't have something to look forward to, and three weeks is too long to wait. I need to feel good now or else I'll just give up. 

Any advice would be appreciated."
3996,Where Would You Go?,"If you were being a realistic, young adult, with little cash and not to many personal connections... Where would you go? 

I think I need of change in scenery. Maybe for a day or so, but maybe longer. Any suggestions?"
3997,Hair loss is destroying me,"I’m a 20 Year old male.


I just turned 20, noticed diffuse thinning on my head for around 4 months now (although hair line  had been starting to recede slightly from a kid hairline to a slightly 'mature' hairline, just saw the dermatologist a couple days back and he told me I likely had telogen effluvium (i deal with an anxiety disorder) and also mpb. Hair is very thin currently.

Im really at a loss right now, its terribly difficult to go through this due to the sheer uncertainty and of course all the other reasons I'm sure you are very familiar with. Something that has also made this whole experience all the more painful has been reading hair loss forums of tens of thousands of young men who are in a similar situation as me and who are acting like going bald is the end of f*cking world and that being bald only leads to a miserable, sexless existence. These are really convincing me it will be a reality for me to and it’s so hard to deal with. My self confidence is shot and I dread every day what’s to come.

I'm just sort of floating right now, not really sure what to do and that uncertainty is the hardest part. My options are trying to fight it with finasteride (although I’m very scared of the side effects and potential ramifications on my body/brain), shave it off and accept the hair loss at a very young age. keep my hair as is and ride it out (this sounds like potentially the most stressful option however) or do something drastic like get a hair system or try and save up for a transplant. 

Im very sorry for the long rambly message, any responses and advice would be amazing."
3998,"Just a severely depressed eighteen year old that’s destructed their body, hates themself, will never be happy, and wants to die","I WANNA DIE I WANNA DIE I WANNA DIE I WANNA DIE I’M SO SICK of hurting myself every day because I fucking hate being in the world and I cannot feel happy. I’m too traumatized and I really fucking do not want to make it into a new decade and my 19th birthday. I need to die really soon but I don’t know what to do to achieve that goal. I’ve been horribly depressed through high school. I have absolutely nothing going for me but hurting myself all day long and that’s no one’s fault but my own and my mentally fucked up brain. I just don’t feel any care for myself at all and I don’t want to do this for another day. I need out of this so bad, I was meant to die ages ago it feels like. If I would have successfully died when I first attempted suicide, I would have never met the years of trauma and pain after that. But I’m still here just abusing myself because I hate myself and I’m ready to go on. I just am so fucking sick of this. I feel so damaged and torn apart and broken, I couldn’t make my body feel any worse."
3999,"When it gets this bad, I go big-picture","I keep thinking that, again infinite odds, I get to experience life in a lifeless universe, on a teeming planet, during the greatest time in human history, in a safe country, in a beautiful state--though only for a moment. 

But because I'm depressed, I don't have the chance to take advantage of that. I barely have the emotional capacity to watch Bob's Burgers on repeat. I feel like someone's got a death grip on my stomach, and I can barely get out of bed."
